welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at microsoft's recently released flight simulator 2020 and see how it compares to the previous entry to the series flight simulator x now before we get started bear in mind that flight simulator x released way back almost 15 years ago so we should expect to see improvements in just about every aspect with the latest title so the goal for this video is to highlight what exactly microsoft has managed to improve since then including the quality of the vehicle models the environment the lighting design and various other effects along with a brief demonstration of how the planes themselves are handled for this demonstration both games are being played on the pc with the graphics settings pushed as high as possible at a native 4k resolution i also want to thank both microsoft for providing the key for the title and thrustmaster for hooking me up with a tca sidestick airbus edition joystick which i will be using throughout this video in both games alright so let's kick this comparison off by taking a look at the quality of the vehicle models starting with the 747 passenger jet now at first glance these two models look incredibly similar but when you get in closer that illusion quickly fades away as the latest game has much higher quality textures along with a vastly higher poly count and improved shaders everything from the turbines to the landing gear all feature much more detail and also no longer appear to be clipping through the ground the passenger windows which appeared blocky and pixelated in flight cmx are now perfectly clean ovals with a new cube map shader applied to each set of windows to create the illusion of an interior space the only actual fully rendered interior space is the cockpit that is absolutely loaded with detail now flight sim x is similar in this regard though as you can see every dial knob and cable is now much more complex and the scaling appears more natural than it ever did before all the text from various dials and screens is now more legible with no sign of pixelation and the various leds appear like they're actually emitting light rather than just being given a different color tone moving on to the beechcraft baron g58 we see a lot of the same enhancements have been made the model has been completely made from scratch with much rounder curves and smoother edges and a lot of those small texture details like the rivets along the wings and fuselage are less pronounced blending in more seamlessly with the body of the plane though i do want to point out that despite flight sim x's much lower quality textures and less intricate designs the planes do still feature almost exactly the same characteristics like the lights attached to the turbines or the many pieces that made up the shape of the landing gear then of course we have the classic cessna with the sus now we get a much clearer picture of just how much better the interior spaces appear in the latest game all the dials and flight sim x appear to be digitized textures that feel like they aren't actually a part of the scene itself you'll probably notice this most with the attitude indicator that doesn't update nearly as smoothly as the indicator in flight sim 2020 there's this tangible depth now with things like the yolk no longer being the only thing that looks three-dimensional in the space the textures are also much more advanced with better representations of different materials like weather and plastic and there's also new dials and knobs that just weren't there before now we of course also need to talk about the environments fights mx allows players to take off from hundreds of different airstrips from around the world and fly across a lot of familiar landmarks and cities all with seemingly authentic scaling and terrain but of course back in the mid 2000s trying to render the entire world without any sort of sophisticated ai to assist was just an impossibility and so you get a lot of these cookie-cutter structures and assets thrown in all over the place in a way that only slightly resembles the real world with flight sim 2020 the development team have come up with a far more sophisticated method for creating the world that you fly in rather than trying to cram all that data into players hard drives flight sim 2020 uses a cloud streaming system to assist in generating the world this allows thousands of gigs of data to be streamed into the game generating a world using what appears to be satellite images like google maps this allows for almost perfect terrain reconstruction with groups of trees and buildings all being properly placed throughout the world along with approximate elevation levels to simulate hills and valleys it really does look amazing and the immense draw distance makes the old flight sim game look like a mobile title by comparison that being said it's not perfect either i explored a lot of different locations and noticed some recurring problems with the data streaming design like water along the thames river improperly forming hills and rectangular structures and cityscapes appearing like misshapen obelisks and spires i even flew over places i've actually been in real life and found things like trees and buildings were not being properly represented with placeholder structures and vast jungles being used to compensate for satellite imagery with dark shadows still disregarding the occasional glitch in the matrix it's absolutely incredible what's been accomplished here this is literally the entire world built to scale in a video game flying from san francisco to los angeles will legitimately take about an hour and a half to accomplish whereas in the older game the world feels much more condensed just look at how much closer the golden gate bridge is to alcatraz whereas in the latest game the bridge appears accurately far off in the distance and all the most iconic landmarks have been given extra attention like the statue of liberty that looks much better now than it did before one of the most impressive sites though at least one flying around the states was the grand canyon that previously just looked like someone had carved into the terrain with an elevation brush but now uses real elevation data to simulate the absolutely incredible vastness of the real world location it's still a little rough around the edges with textures coming in kind of muddy and stretching around objects in the world but it's great looking nonetheless it's also worth mentioning that the new flight simulator even features fully rendered fauna in some areas like herds of giraffe roaming in the valley near the blue nile there's not a lot of animals in the game but it's still a fun feature that i hope is added to further then of course there's the lighting lighting is absolutely gorgeous in this latest century the last flight simulator had some alright lighting effects for the time like some enhanced bloom to simulate the sun's reflection especially along the bright white metals of various planes but it was ultimately noticeably flat and baked in with flight simulator 2020 the lighting feels much more realistic especially when utilizing an hdr display light will pour in through gaps and clouds casting rays of light down on the surface of the earth and will even move realistically based on the position of the clouds themselves you'll also notice light illuminate pockets of fog especially during the early morning or late evening and it all seems to be reflected on objects in the world as well providing a consistent image with flight sim x you get this impression that regardless of the lighting preset selected the world below doesn't really seem to reflect it at all the skybox changes color but it otherwise feels like the lighting system is independent of everything else this is not the case with flight sim 2020 as everything feels genuinely connected providing a far more immersive experience as a result this game even features some nice reflective surfaces for the body of the plane and the cockpit windows allowing flight instruments to appear in your peripheral vision reflected on the side windows when flying at night the impact of the reworked lighting is even more apparent cities have actual light pollution now that will cause the atmosphere to glow from far away you'll also notice a lot more street lights than before along with more vehicle tail and headlights letting the city that never sleeps live up to its name i was a little disappointed when i flew over paris though as i found that the eiffel tower was not the glowing beacon i was hoping to see it apparently has automatic light sensors in real life that ensure that it's lit every night so i'm not quite sure why it's pitch black at night here considering other structures are properly lit this may be some sort of bug but disregarding the one or two issues i'm impressed with the look and feel of the nighttime scenes and flying a red eye and turning on the interior cabin lights looks really authentic shadows have benefited even more though gone are those sharp simplistic shadows used before replaced by much softer real-time shadow effects that actually project all the smallest details along the plane and within the interior even more impressive though are the long distance shadows especially for the generated structures on the ground when flying through a city in the old game only a few structures would actually cast shadows while the smaller buildings just sort of stood out without any sort of shading at all the latest game doesn't suffer from this problem as every single structure and group of trees now acquit cast shadows relative to the position of the sun and the cloud layer which brings us to our next section the effects despite the very straightforward premise behind something like a flight simulator game there's actually several different effects used to help enhance the experience water simulation for example looks much better now with improved reflective surfaces and superior texture work giving it a much more believable appearance it still doesn't react to the player's vehicle and instead of emergency water landing showing a big splash like before the screen just fades to black right before you hit anything but given that this is a flight simulator and you probably shouldn't be trying to skim the ocean with a 747 i can see why this effect wasn't a priority for the development team what apparently was a priority though was the cloud simulation the clouds in flight sim 2020 are some of the best looking clouds i've ever seen in a game they aren't just four to six different preset cloud configurations like in fight sim x but rather a complex system of volumetric objects that are based on real world weather data this gives them a real presence in the sky and it looks even more impressive when dealing with thick cloud layers or storms you'll even notice condensation accumulate on the windows as you pass through dense cloud formations the more intense weather is a huge improvement as well in the old game a heavy storm would just feature lots of dark clouds increase the wind turbulence to shake the plane around and would feature this ugly repeated series of rain effects directly around the player it looks really bad especially when looking up into the center of it and the water drops themselves are these weird long stripes that seem to always be coming from the same angle regardless of your orientation flight sim 2020 doesn't suffer from this problem rain looks much more realistic with not only small rain droplets that will splash against the window but even distant rainfalls being accurately represented by clusters of volumetric clouds being stretched downwards towards the surface you can even fly in and around storms rather than just the storm sort of triggering around you and fading away like before heavy snowfall is even more intense though unlike the gigantic snowballs that would flood the screen before snowflakes themselves are a bit more subtle and the real threat is the incredibly dense fog that makes it nearly impossible to see this is much more realistic and will require players to rely more so on their fight instruments to help guide them through the storm then of course we have to talk briefly about the controls now i've only flown a real plane once so i can't really speak for the authenticity of how these planes fly but when using the same thrustmaster tca side stick and configuring the settings to be as realistic as possible it's pretty obvious almost immediately which game feels more realistic starting with a simple takeoff there's a huge change in how the acceleration is handled in flight simx the plane just steadily accelerates before reaching a top speed and won't lift off until you pull back pretty hard on the stick the distance and max speed doesn't seem to make much of a difference as long as you reach a certain speed threshold of each aircraft and throw in the correct input in flight sim 2020 the plane has a noticeable weight to it trying to pull up too early may lift the front wheel up but it'll drop right back down pretty quickly causing it to bounce a bit but with enough speed the plane will lift itself up on its own similar to how a real plane would function and you just need to pull back the joystick to increase your elevation further once in the air the actual controls are mostly identical you have to manually retract the landing gear and adjust your flaps and all the pitch yaw and rudder controls are handled the same way however just like with takeoff the newer game is a little bit more difficult to maneuver and trying to perform stressful maneuvers can even instantly fail your flight flight sim x is a lot more forgiving in this regard and by default you can even bounce off of the ground without any threat to your aircraft though you can of course enable more realistic damage which will fail your game instantly as well finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you think has the better audio design [Music] [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] v1 [Music] [Music] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall i think it's safe to say that the latest flight simulator 2020 is a massive improvement visually over its predecessor everything from the complexity of the vehicle models the far more accurate representation of earth and the feel of the controls is a noticeable step up from flight sim x and is certainly one of the most impressive looking titles on the pc platform that being said it's also one of the most incredibly demanding titles on the pc at 4k with all the graphics maxed out using a 2080 ti and an i7 8700k processor i ran into situations where the frame rate would dip down into the mid-20s at times bordering at unplayable there's just so much being rendered at once that it seems the cpu just can't handle it all with the ryzen 9 3900x i fared a little bit better but in dense cities you can absolutely expect a huge hit to performance but this isn't exclusive to the new flight simulator this is actually a problem that still plagues flight sim x where the frame rate will tank whenever i do a flyover of new york city it's something that fans of this style of game should already be plenty aware of but if you're new to the series don't be surprised when your monster gaming rig struggles with everything cranked up it's a remarkable experience and an incredibly realistic one to boot but fans of flight sim x's thousands of mods and expansions may feel a little bit limited jumping into the newest flight sim right away sure it looks beautiful and is a much more authentic experience but this new game still has a long way to go before it matches the massive amount of content offered by the steam re-release of flight sim x it does seem microsoft is going to fully support community content which is great but it'll definitely take some time for that content to start making the rounds if you do want to try out this game i also highly recommend picking up a fight stick to play with the tca side stick works perfectly for this game and was even recognized immediately upon booning it up with all the controls already being set up properly you may need to tweak the sensitivity of the rudders as they feel a little bit too sensitive at first but otherwise it really is a game changer and a huge step up from using a keyboard or an xbox controller if you're interested in this particular joystick you can find a link for it in the description but what do you guys think are you impressed with flight simulator 2020 or are you going to stick with flight sim x for now let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more
