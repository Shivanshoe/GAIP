welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take an in-depth look at the mass effect legendary edition and see how it compares to each of the original mass effect titles from the main trilogy for reference all games are being played and recorded on a pc with the graphics settings cranked up as high as possible at a native 4k resolution however i will be disabling some of the post-processing effects like motionbar and film grain to provide cleaner image captures alright so let's kick this comparison off by first looking at some character models starting with our lead protagonist commander shepard now naturally the first game i booted up to look at was the original mass effect from 2007 but i was surprised to find that even with the segs cranked up as high as possible the quality of the models in this game just looked terrible by default but as it turns out this is actually a common bug with the game where the lod isn't set properly with the newer digital releases on steam or origin so after tweaking some lines in a configuration file i did manage to get the high quality versions of the textures to kick in and the result comes pretty darn close to what you'll find in the latest legendary edition release of the game the poly count for example remains the same so if you zoom in real close you'll find the same number of lines used to make up the curvature of his head and ears only the aliasing isn't nearly as bad this time around additionally you'll notice that the texture maps have been updated to support higher resolutions giving shepard much more detail along his cheeks and brow and similarly the eyes have been enhanced with more detailed irises that reflect light more realistically but the most noticeable improvements to shepard can be found with his armor with new carbon fiber texture maps applied to some of the torso paneling and more visible scratched paint along the red band on his right arm the changes here really helps shepard and his colleagues armor stand out better in the scene and the inclusion of the carbon fiber style helps bring the armor design more in line with the style used in later mass effect titles without compromising the general look of the armor as a whole unfortunately not all the changes made to shepherd have been for the better i did find some of the animation work to be a bit off now like in regards to the way shepherd's eyes behave most noticeable in this sequence after the introductory mission where his eyes are now so wide open that he looks completely insane at times it's a very odd problem that persists throughout the game and seems to mainly affect shepard alone and thankfully the rest of the characters don't suffer from this at least not to the same degree like with shepard all the characters throughout the game feature new textures along their outfits and faces giving them a lot more depth and complexity and with the rework to the lighting they do appear quite different in pretty much every scene i was able to match up but the changes become much less apparent as we move on to the other two entries in the series in mass effect 2 for example things like the eyes and the animations haven't been altered quite as much and the only real changes you'll find are the higher res textures and the improved anti-aliasing by mass effect 3 the changes are even more difficult to spot facial textures are almost identical between versions with only a slightly sharper image with the legendary addition and finer texture details like stitching buttons and leather along clothing can be made out much better now the character models across each of the three games have all seen some great improvements overall with the most noticeable changes found in the original game and the only thing i'd like to see tweaked in this area would be those unsettling eyes of shepherds and mass effect 1. moving on we have the environments the environments have seen quite the update as well especially in mass effect 1. pretty much every surface in the game has been overhauled with much better texture maps that no longer appear super blurry when played at a higher resolution and because many of the finer details utilized low poly assets bioware even rebuilt some of these objects and helped add to the terrain to help deliver a much more convincing natural space take this cliffside for example that previously just dropped off at the edge with a single series of brown textures rather than just updating those textures the developers actually populated this cliff edge with new rock objects to make the drop-off appear more believable while simultaneously giving the scene more variety the 3d grass objects populating the world have also been greatly expanded upon and new rocks have been added to give the ground more dimension other changes include additional decorative assets added into the background of out-of-reach areas like new trees here in the space station and a few small alterations to npc pathing that i'll talk about more in a bit oddly enough when it comes to the quality of the environments the good news kind of ends with the remaster of the first game mass effect 2's texture updates are either so small that they're negligible or in some rare cases a bit of a step back this snowy surface at the beginning of the first mission for example looks less impressive in the remaster with simpler texture maps and less bump mapping overall there's even some props that have been removed entirely like this weird broken turbine off to the side but other than those few examples most of the game worlds in mass effect 2 do sport higher resolution textures than before so while it's not as noticeable it's still a net gain nonetheless with mass effect 3 the changes are even less impressive sure the ground textures are also updated here and are a bit sharper but like with mass effect 2 there's some surfaces that have been altered too much and seemed to lack the detail they had before what's even more disappointing is that there's a few areas that were broken in the original release that still haven't been properly addressed like these floating rocks off to the side of the ship's landing site in this desert region you can tell they've certainly made some changes and the floating surface isn't nearly as noticeable now but it's odd that this wasn't just fixed entirely considering work was definitely done here i think collectively the updates to the environments in mass effect 2 and 3 are really just not all that great especially if you've already played these games on the pc before and he'd probably experience the full effect of the upgrades if he had only played these titles on their original console platforms instead the lighting on the other hand is an area that has been greatly updated across the board practically every scene in each game has reworked lighting effects drastically changing the look and feel of the experience take this intro mission in mass effect 1 for example previously the player is dropped off on the planet with the sun setting over the rear cliffsides with a nearly blinding sun glare if the player decided to turn around but in the remaster the sun has been moved to the right side behind the many trees allowing light to pour in with some baked in volumetric effects and new godway implementation also the ambient lighting isn't quite as foreboding as before which may be divisive for fans as it does directly impact the tone of the mission as a whole but there's no denying that the way the light reacts to the world and the characters is no doubt more technically impressive now on top of this mass effect legendary edition also makes liberal use of some nice new reflective properties for many of its surfaces that do a great job of projecting key scenes to simulate a real reflection interestingly bioware decided to steer clear of the popular screen space reflection method for this opting for more expensive planar reflections instead it's a really nice looking effect though because of how it's handled it only appears at very specific scenes and so a lot of areas that should have reflections still don't in fact in mass effect 2 i even found areas where older cube maps and shader techniques like along this metal surface have been removed entirely with the remaster though thankfully these instances are a bit rare because the lighting remains static across all three remasters bioware has also decided to make a few adjustments to the static light rays present in some key areas these spotlights for example are cleaned up a bit so the base of the light is no longer showing and a few areas throughout the game like this valley here now have new light rays added in that account for the repositioned sun while most of these changes are for the better there are still a few minor goops mixed in most notably this skylight in the council chambers where the white rays seem to be improperly segmented considering its position it's something very few players will ever even notice but it's an area that could use some attention nonetheless with mass effect 2 and 3 the alterations to the lighting are present but more subtle it seems as though they were happy with how the scenes looked in these two games so all the cutscenes and gameplay areas match up pretty much the same way only there's some improved bloom effects and shader implementation spread throughout to give the game a newer feel the shadows are an area that have also seen quite a few changes but sadly i feel as though there haven't been nearly enough improvements still shadow projections still behave completely independent of the level's light sources causing shadows to unnaturally appear in locations that don't make sense at all lights on the ground will somehow cast shadows directly under the player rather than against the wall or ceiling and while the wonky bouncing shadows and delayed projections have been updated to be more consistent in the remaster it would have been nice to see true dynamic shadow implementation here the only upside to this is that the shadows that are on display are much cleaner than the original counterparts with far less differing and practically no noticeable aliasing shadows also have a more natural softer appearance across players faces no longer shrouding them in darkness and hiding their facial emotes i think with the shadows the developers probably wanted to make more changes but decided against it as they would probably need to redo how each and every scene is set up in order to account for the lighting already in place so cleaning up some of the rough edges and removing the more obvious inconsistencies was probably the right call and with mass effect 2 and 3 just like with the other visual effects the changes are pretty negligible suggesting that they were fine with how this was handled already and made only a few minor alterations next up we have effects the effects in mass effect 2 and 3 have also not really changed that much the fire is cleaned up a bit especially in mass effect 2 and the explosions have more particles but all of these changes are tiny when compared to the great improvements made to the effects in mass effect 1. the particle density has been cranked up significantly with this game which is apparent right away when venturing through this forested region in the first mission fire effects are also more complex now with more dense smoke and ember particles added on top and other more stunning effects like the big electrical flash from this mass relay in the introductory cutscene have been given a great overhaul cleaning up the electrical currents and cramming in a lot more detail even the water surfaces have been given some much needed attention with the parallax surface being changed into something more modern which is then coupled with those improved reflections to sell the illusion further the fluid physics are still practically non-existent and i found some of the destructive props don't exhibit quite the same physical properties as before but otherwise the changes made to the effects all seem to benefit the design of the game as a whole and before we get to our final sound comparison i also want to point out that while mass effect 2 and 3 play identically to their original counterparts mass effect 1's gameplay design has also been tweaked a bit to help modernize the experience slightly this is most apparent when looking at the heads-up display that's simplified a bit and built more strongly around the look of the gamepad enabled hud the team command function has also been cleaned up making it easier to give squad orders and the ai pathing both for allies and for enemies has been modified allowing for much smoother squad based combat additionally all three games now fully support optional gamepads when played on the pc which i think is always a nice touch for modern pc titles finally let's wrap up this analysis with a brief sound comparison which version of each game do you feel offers the best sound quality and design no no i can destroy i'm on it all clear hmm overload will take out their shield try to overload the shields oh and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall the mass effect legendary edition is a fine package that delivers some much needed visual enhancements to the original title along with some far less impressive improvements to mass effect 2 and 3. from the hours i've had playing each of the three games it's become clear that the goal for this project was just to clean up the game without changing what fans loved about the series all the cutscenes with the exception of a few in mass effect 2 remained nearly identical with the same camera angles voiceover work and dialogue paths from before all the combat remains about the same with the exception being mass effect 1's updated controls and hud elements and really the only big difference with this release is the updated lighting and texture quality it's a shame we didn't get to see the full remake of these games as i feel the jump to later iterations of the unreal engine would certainly do the series justice especially in regards to its static lighting design and strange shadow projections but for players looking to jump into the series for the first time especially for those playing on the consoles i highly recommend checking out this package as the few technical hiccups and the lack of mass effect 3's multiplier are easily outweighed by the series's phenomenal story and gameplay design but what do you guys think are you impressed with mass effect legendary edition or
