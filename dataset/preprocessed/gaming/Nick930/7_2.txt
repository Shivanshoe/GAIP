welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at volition's upcoming reboot to the saints row series and see how it compares from a gameplay and content perspective to the most recently released saints row game saints row the third remastered now to be clear saints row iii is not technically the most recent mainline entry to the series in fact there's been two other entries since then including saints row 4 and a standalone expansion called got out of hell but as those two games are so wildly different from most other entries in the series i felt it was more appropriate to stick with saints row 3 for this particular comparison especially when considering just how much this upcoming reboot seems to take inspiration from it for reference i'll be playing saints row 3 remastered on the pc with the settings cranked up as high as possible at a native 4k resolution however for the newer game i was only able to test a small sliver of the experience by means of a newly released character customization demo called the boss factory with it players can freely customize their own boss or playable character and upload their creation to volition servers to be used later in the final release and if you want to give this a try for yourself you can download it now for free using the link that i provided in the description because of this demo's limited scope i want to spend less time talking about the graphics and more about the gameplay features and various other mechanics though i will be sure to follow this up at a later date with a full technical analysis when i get some hands-on time with the open world alright so to kick this comparison off let's first talk about the setting offered in each game in saints row 3 players explore a sprawling urban playground called steelport which takes inspiration from modern american cities like new york pittsburgh and bridgeport because of this steelport is composed primarily of towering skyscrapers large industrial zones and rows of apartment complexes all broken up by distinct districts but their own set of side missions and chaotic activities it's a playground of pure mayhem the one that's admittedly pretty tame by today's standards there's very little terrain variety here and despite being in a large city there's not a lot of verticality and typical gameplay encounters outside of a few mission-specific structures the new saints row on the other hand aims to deliver a much more modern take on an open world environment going beyond the boundaries of the concrete jungle and including more natural environments to explore as well this location given the name santo lasso is inspired heavily by the american southwest mainly las vegas and its surrounding area with lots of deserts canyons mesas and the occasional small town like with saints row 3 santa lasso is broken up into different districts each with their own unique look and feel some of the districts already confirmed include rancho providencia a sort of derelict rundown town that plays host to the panteros gang monte vista a high-end residential area with lots of fancy hillside mansions and frequent parties hosted by the deadly idols and the busy downtown area of lakeshore owned and operated by the corrupt marshall corporation from what's been shown so far santa laso certainly looks to be a much more interesting location to explore than steelport based on the variety alone though how players interact with these worlds is arguably even more important which brings us to our next topic the core mission structure saints row 3 is built on a traditional open world format there's main mission start icons placed on the map that you have to drive to with some scripted action sequences to help progress the plot and along with those are a bunch of smaller less interesting side missions to expand on other specific aspects of the gameplay like combat and driving the goal of the game is to take control of the city for your gang the saints by completing missions in each district buying property and fighting off other rival gangs on the street the newer saints row game seems to follow the same basic premise with a player working with their gang to build a name for themselves and take control of the city however missions are now tied more directly to the purchased businesses instead giving the game world a more immersive feel as a result buying a disposal facility for example will unlock missions where you need to illegally dump toxic waste while purchasing the let's pretend building will provide a base of operations to prepare heists where you can serve as the getaway driver during a robbery and of course fan favorite side missions like insurance fraud make a return as well and can be accessed by purchasing the shady tokes business by tying missions to businesses players have more incentive to expand their empire outside of just earning extra money and by attributing these businesses to specific districts this newer game world seems to provide more character and personality to each of its locations which in effect should make the world a bit more immersive moving on we have the progression system in saints row 3 progression is tied to xp earned by contributing to the mayhem in the city large explosions and big gang wars are often great ways to rank up and unlock more powerful abilities then using the cell phone players can choose between a wide range of player upgrades across several different categories allowing them to increase their stats to near superhuman levels including options to disable fall damage sprint infinitely without getting tired or fire weapons without needing to reload oddly the saints row reboot feels a bit more restricted when it comes to this system while progression and money are still used to unlock and purchase new skills and abilities players can't use all their unlocks at the same time active skills for example have to be selected from a list and equipped into one of four slots on a diamond passive perks on the other hand have more slots to make use of but these tiers will slowly unlock as the player progresses through the game as well my guess is that this was done to help ground saint rose gameplay a bit more preventing players from turning into unstoppable superhumans within the first few hours on the bright side some of these new abilities feature do look like they can add a lot of fun new approaches to combat encounters not offered previously players can for instance attach grenades to enemies and toss them towards a group of hostiles shoot from the top of a moving vehicle while in a prone position roll from side to side to dodge attacks and use their cars to sideswipe pursuers and deal extra damage players can also deploy a new wingsuit now to help soar across santeleos and can even bounce off of nearby pedestrians for an extra boost it's just as absurd as you'd expect from a saints row game albeit with some slightly more modern touches but the real standout feature that i actually was able to test out firsthand is the game's reworked customization system customization has always been key to the saints row franchise and has greatly expanded over the years to allow players to tweak everything from their face hair and clothing all the way to their sex appeal in saints row 3 all the player customization options are made available to the player by various storefronts found throughout the open world these stores are specifically themed around different styles of clothing meaning one store might have expensive flashy leather jackets while another might have more casual wear the player's base appearance on the other hand can only be changed via a special plastic surgeon store called image as designed here players can tweak their character's body face hair makeup and other miscellaneous things like the character's voice and emotes they can even make use of several different sliders to fine-tune the appearance of every part of their character's face allowing them to mold the model into whatever the player wants but some of the preset accessories namely hair are a bit limited the new saints row game however aims to address this head on with far fewer restrictions and a more streamlined character customization system overall first you're no longer stuck returning to a nearby store or headquarters just to swap your own clothes or your appearance all of that can be accessed right from the player's menus even standing in the middle of the street additionally the appearance customization sliders themselves are expanded a great deal to allow for greater freedom in design sex for example is no longer offered as an option to switch between opting for a more neutral design where players can modify their groin and chest size however they want players can also freely modify sides of the character's face individually if they want a less symmetrical look and can even adjust multiple color tones for individual accessories like hair and clothing in fact this system is so robust that with all the unlocked clothing and accessories found in the game you can really build any character that you want from celebrities and pop culture icons to iconic video game characters there's still a very cartoony vibe to these characters but it's a massive improvement visually over the weirdly disproportionate and boxy designs of the characters in saints row 3 regardless of how much he tried to adjust the scaling but the saints row reboot doesn't stop there customization is also available for other aspects of the game that previously were not expanded all that much weapons for example can now be fully customized with different attachments and unique skins and cosmetic accessories as opposed to saints row 3 where you essentially just upgraded weapons through 4 tiers and that was it crib customization from the fan favorite saints row 2 also makes a bit of a return as players can now customize their main headquarters or the church and give it an updated facade interior decoration and tweak the appearance of ai gang members vehicle customization also returns though from what's been shown it only seems to have been marginally improved upon the vehicle customization in saints row 3 was already pretty robust with options to tweak the finish interior underglow wheels and body kit modifications but the reboot does add more options to each of these categories to help flush them out further and with a much larger selection of different vehicle types to play around with vehicle variety in general appears to be much greater and that's pretty much all we have to go off of for the time being overall the saints row reboot looks to be taking things back to basics to some extent ignoring the overt silliness of saints row foreign got out of hell in favor of the slightly more grounded though still very silly saints road iii there's a lot of things from that game that still feel recycled back into the fold most notably this identical carjacking animation though i do appreciate many of the new quality of life improvements being incorporated as well including the expanded combat maneuvers customization options and the much more intriguing open world environment and while we didn't speak much about the visuals this time i will say that from what i've seen so far the saints row reboot does look to be an improvement graphically as well with higher poly count character models much better dynamic lighting effects and some nice particle density but again i'll save my full analysis for when i get some more proper hands-on time with the game so what do you guys think so far does volition's reimagine saints row experience do enough different from the previous entries like saints row 3 or do you feel there's something missing let me know in the comments section also just a reminder the boss factory demo is available to download and play around with today so be sure to give that a shot and as always don't forget to like and subscribe for more content like this posted every week
