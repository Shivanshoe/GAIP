welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released pc version of santa monica studios highly regarded god of war and see how it improves upon the original version running on a playstation 5. for this analysis the playstation version of the game will be set to its high performance mode as this has been proven to provide a near flawless presentation with the increased frame rate benefit all outputting on a 4k display thanks to its checkerboarding solution the pc version on the other hand will have its options cranked up to the absolute highest settings at a native 4k resolution and both versions will have their motion blur and film grain options turned down for the sake of capturing cleaner still images also before we move on i do want to thank sony for sending me not just the key to test this on the pc but also a set of their brand new color options for the dual sense controllers if you're looking to bulk up your controller collection and like something a bit different than the default white pads you can grab the nova pink starlight blue and galactic purple now at participating retailers alright so let's kick this comparison off by first checking to see if any of the character models have been improved upon starting with the god of war himself kratos now i just want to preface this section by first saying the changes here are subtle extremely subtle so much so that they're nearly indistinguishable between platforms under normal playing conditions of the same texture maps high quality animations and the beautiful attention to detail is there no matter which system you're playing the game on whether that be the playstation 4 pro version or this most recent pc version however there are still some changes that can be observed when zooming in extremely close during this initial cutscene for example you'll find that many of the details along kratos armor are slightly crisper on the pc an even more obvious example is his beard that no longer feels as pixelated as it did before this is most likely the result of the pc's locked native 4k output resolution as the playstation version uses checkerboarding to help simulate a 4k image considering this is nearly impossible to see from a normal viewing distance the checkerboarding method does a fantastic job but the pc version not quite as limited from a hardware perspective doesn't need to cut corners and thus produces a much more impressive output but strangely this isn't always the case throughout this cutscene i did run into some peculiar low res looking textures specifically during this moment where kratos lays the cadaver on the fire atreus's clothing here looks much muddier on the pc than the playstation at first i thought this might have been a texture loading issue or perhaps an actual low res texture but if you look closely you'll notice that the depth of field effect throughout this scene feels slightly different once the camera rotates around to show kratos the effect seems to focus more on kratos than it did before meaning the way the depth of field is handled is slightly different resulting in a slightly different presentation again it's barely noticeable but it does impact the clarity of the scene in many cases outside of the cutscenes things do thankfully lean more in favor of the pc version from a normal camera distance details along kratos are nearly perfect with much cleaner textures along the model itself the red mark along his eye in particular appears almost perfectly now as opposed to the playstation version where you'll pick up on some very obvious pixelated edges when the camera is zoomed in closer this pixelation does not appear on the playstation at all but even still you'll notice that the pc version's higher res textures produce much more clarity like around the iris ear there's still a few areas that have not been improved that maybe could have been kratos's arm shield still has this really blurry texture along the edge but other areas like the decorative etchings along the leviathan axe hold up even better now on the pc next let's take a look at the environment like with the character models the environments look almost virtually identical to each other regardless of which platform you decide to play on all the textures are in the same places each location is just as richly detailed and the pathing and level sizes are not altered in any noticeable way what has changed though is a sizeable bump to the game's lod on the playstation 5 version players may notice some minor texture popping occurring at a set distance usually for very small environmental details things like high-res textures on distant trees and small objects like rocks and stones will literally pop into existence just far enough to not be too distracting but on the pc this issue is practically non-existent while this method is no doubt still being used the lod is now high enough that you'll likely never see it occur unless you're in much larger areas as for the textures and level geometry itself god of war on the pc looks practically identical all the various boulders trees dirt paths and wooden structures appear the same save for some minor bumps to the texture resolution and of course that 4k output resolution but the textures that looked muddy before will unfortunately still look the same way on the pc which i do feel is a slight missed opportunity however minor these assets may be to the presentation though it is at least worth mentioning that this is a third person action game so small textured details in the game world are much less noticeable than they would have been in say a first person shooter title moving on we have the game's lighting and shadowing here's where things get a little bit more interesting at first glance all the lighting seems mostly the same between the two versions all the god rays are in more or less the same places the volumetrics and light maps seem to match up and even some of those weird bloom effects like here under the side of kratos house are still there as well but you may have noticed a very subtle alteration to the game's coloration to be clear none of the brightness or gamma settings within the game itself have been changed from their default value and the settings on my own displays have no impact on the way that these recordings were made so the differences here are purely based on the versions themselves as the pc version seems to lack some of the saturation that was in the playstation version the pc version also benefits from reworked global illumination and ambient occlusion techniques making things like the shadows cast by kratos's armor slightly more natural looking this is most noticeable when viewing interior scenes as light will now more properly bounce off of surfaces and illuminate objects that would have otherwise been left in shadow kratos head for example now stands out a bit more in this scene and the interior of the hut is a bit brighter overall another big change is the inclusion of more accurate screen space reflections this particular edition is not nearly as prevalent despite there being plenty of areas with water and puddles the screen space reflection technique seems extremely limited and only appears in areas like the shiny floors in the center mid guard room other areas that would have benefited from these reflections like this second troll boss location still make use of the same cube map reflections as before which really aren't all that impressive and fail to show any of the character models or the effects on the bright side god of war on the pc does at least offer vastly superior shadows overall almost all of the environmental objects cast shadows now as opposed to before where only a few select trees would cast projections the shadows that are shared between these games also look better on the pc with sharper edges and less dithering the only potential downside to the inclusion of more shadows is that they do sometimes directly impact the presentation of some of the cutscenes the scene where atreus is hunting his first deer is now cast almost exclusively in shadow whereas before atreus was brightly lit by the sun it's subtle but there's instances of this all throughout that feel different than before because of the change next we have effects now this is an area that i fully expected to look much better on the pc due to the increased power of the hardware available including an expansion to the number of particle effects but surprisingly the number of particles was already really high in the original version of the game and the pc version seems to match this almost exactly with any more particles likely feeling excessive however i did notice that like with the environmental textures particle effects have a slightly longer draw distance this time around allowing things like these fire embers to continue to appear in the distance while the playstation version sees these particles smoothly disappear once the player is far enough away other than that though the effects like water fire explosions and other scripted destruction all appear virtually identical regardless of the platform finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison now personally i didn't notice any major differences in how the sound was presented here but the section will at least provide some samples of the game in action so feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section below if you notice any changes either to the sound or the visuals that i may not have mentioned previously [Music] hmm [Music] oh [Music] hmm [Music] yes [Music] uh [Applause] oh we have no choice we have no choice okay just tell me when to shoot and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall god of war on the pc is a very very slight improvement on a game that many already consider to be flawless textures have been improved a bit for both characters and the environment the resolution can now be hard locked to 4k the frame rate can be unlocked shadows are upgraded and other pc specific options like ultra widescreen are fully supported however i do wish we could have seen a better implementation of screen space reflections or even some other reflection techniques to improve certain areas along with some more touch-ups to other assets throughout the game world i also ran into a weird texture loading bug when entering this interior location suggesting that the game still struggles loading between larger areas on slower drives so i do recommend installing this game on at least a solid state drive if possible as that should help to reduce these issues but other than that this is without a doubt one of the best ways to enjoy this masterpiece of a game and if you haven't played it yet and have a pc that's capable of playing it i highly recommend picking this up and giving it a go so what do you guys think are you impressed with god of war's pc debut or were you expecting more let me know in the comment section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more videos like this
