welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna take another look at call of duty modern warfare and this time see how it compares visually to dices most recent entry to the Battlefield franchise battlefield 5 for this comparison both games are being played on the PC platform at a 1440p resolution and all the graphical settings including Nvidia street-racing effects will be enabled as high as possible however the motion for options will be disabled in order to capture cleaner still images so first off let's take a look at some object in character models at first glance the first thing you'll notice between characters in either game is the coding style that can obviously be attributed to the different time periods bounty of 5 is of course a world war 2 shooter game and while there are some less authentic choices and characters to choose from the outfits are about what you'd expect from that era Call of Duty on the other hand is a shooter that takes place in present day so there's a bit more variety in the outfits available with the new season 2 content reintroducing fan favorites like ghosts Call of Duty's character models are loaded with detail with things like grenades radios flashlights and other tools decorating each skin foul fields characters for the most part are more minimalistic though you can more freely customize things like head pieces pants and jackets to suit your style battlefields models also sport higher-quality textures and feature far more realistic facial models making them look near photorealistic by comparison model Warfare's models are terrible looking but it's still not quite as sharp as the characters on display in the frostbite engine moving on from the characters we have a few shared weapon models between these games now bear in mind that while these weapons share the same name the difference in the time period will most certainly impact some of the design choices here though overall they do look practically identical the car 98 for example looks almost exactly the same though Modern Warfare's version features a shoulder strap along with a few other very small indistinguishable details that aren't shown in battlefield when firing the weapon Call of Duty's animations feel a bit more authentic with more of a visceral kickback and more smoke effects emitted from the however upon chambering the next round the bullet casings seem to eject a bit late and call of duty the reverse is true for the 1911 for bullet casings ejected properly in Call of Duty but aren't even visible in battlefield the weapon models themselves look great in both games though baloff its weapons feature higher resolution textures and come off looking more crisp as a result next let's talk about the complexity of each game's environments as we've discovered in previous videos covering the game modern warfare environments are richly detailed with lots of ruined structures debris and intricate past for players to explore in order to get the jump on their enemies the game features mostly the same locations featured in a single-player campaign like Middle Eastern towns Russia Piccadilly along with several recreated maps from past modern warfare titles battlefield 5 on the other hand features much more variety thanks to its world war 2 setting players can fight across a wide range of locations including northern Africa the Netherlands France Greece and now thanks to chapter 5 the Pacific Theater with several tropical island style locations along with the return of the iconic Wake Island additionally many of these levels feature some great weather effects like rain and snow that not only look cool but have a direct impact on the gameplay making each match feel a little bit different each time you play these maps are beautifully decorated with thick vegetation dynamic objects and an incredible level of detail that far surpasses the more static design of Modern Warfare's maps when viewing the environments up close it looks like another win for battlefield with far more complex grass sprites and surface textures though I did find that some textures like road surfaces and dirt looked pretty lackluster in battlefield making it more inconsistent whereas Call of Duty's textures are pretty much always a decently high quality all throughout now let's talk a bit about lighting as we've explored in past comparisons battlefields lighting is significantly more advanced than the lighting effects used in call of duty modern warfare certainly makes some improvements with more volumetric properties in some instances along with a more realistic color tone than past games in the series but it still can't hold a candle to the lighting used in battlefield 5 there are instances where the lighting can be a bit over done in battlefield directly influencing visibility in the gameplay but as far as realism goes battlefield certainly has the upper hand stone both games also feature some advanced ray tracing effects and call of duty ray tracing is used to enhance the appearance of shadows mainly shadows created from spotlights in the environment shadows with r-tx enabled appear softer along the edges and diffuse more naturally as opposed to the harsh sharp edges when the setting is disabled the effect is barely noticeable but thankfully doesn't impact player performance nearly as much as battlefields implementation now fat 5s ray tracing is built around real-time reflections this effect is far more impressive especially considering the large amount of reflective surfaces throughout each map bars can look at a shiny parked car or store window and actually see themselves along with anything standing behind them something that's simply not possible when running with battlefields more basic screen space reflections it's an impressive effect but it's not perfect as reflections on distant water surfaces look like a pixelated mess and the hits a performance is extreme lowering frames from a steady 100 FPS average back down to around 50 to 60 FPS still it's a really cool effect nonetheless and only strengthens battlefields already strong lead in the wedding department next up let's take a quick look at shadows for the longest time Call of Duty games have not featured any player cast shadows black ops 3 featured it but otherwise it's been completely absent modern warfare 3 introduces player cast shadows and the edges are softly diffused and looked great battlefield shadows aren't quite as clean with lots of rough aliasing around the edges environmental shadows also appear smoother and call of duty but it's important to note that because of benefits more dynamic nature environmental shadows can be influenced by player actions with things like buildings and trees being destroyed and creating new paths for light to shine through Call of Duty's environmental shadows benefit greatly from their static placement in the world likely explaining why it's ray tracing doesn't impact performance quite as much now let's look at some visual effects starting with explosions as expected battlefields explosions are much more dynamic in nature causing a rework of the ground tessellation to simulate craters destroying any props close enough to the blast the fireballs also look more impressive in battlefield with tons of yellow particles dynamic lighting effects and lots of dirt and smoke adding to the complexity Call of Duty's fireballs look decent enough with some sparks dirt and smoke along with excellent sound design but it's not nearly as impactful as explosions in battlefield also call duty incorporates a lens filter effect here almost as if the players wearing goggles it's a strange implementation especially considering that most character models in the game aren't wearing any sort of eyewear and I feel as though it probably would have looked better without the effect at all fire is another area where battlefield has a distinct advantage with beautiful flames coupled with great lighting the Molotov sin called duty however feature much better fire effects than the fire emitted from battlefields incendiary grenades they're different devices sure but the flame effects used in battlefield are disappointing when compared to the other environmental fires in the game battlefield makes up for this though with some great dynamic water effects that ripple as the player waits across the surface and plays a major role in the gameplay call D does get a pass here though as its gameplay doesn't feature water at all and effects involving water or limited to decorative elements off to the side of the map with no real player interaction smoke is another interesting area one to look at the smoke and battlefield looks much better than smoke use and Call of Duty the effect looks more realistic and the way it interacts with the maps of lighting is impressive however the effect itself is practically useless in practice as it covers very little ground and can often be seen through very easily throwing multiple smoke grenades can help to address this but called duty doesn't suffer from this issue at all smoke covers a decent amount of area making it a practical tool and the effect itself while not as impressive is still decent finally let's wrap up with a sound comparison which game do you think has the superior audio design [Applause] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall I think it's safe to conclude that battlefield 5 is a visually superior shooter game over call of duty modern warfare now don't get me wrong modern warfare has made some incredible improvements visually over past Call of Duty games and is in a much better place now thanks to the efforts by Infinity Ward it has more advanced character models fantastic weapon animations and the improvements made to the lighting effects look great but the frostbite engine has been evolving also and ballad 5s presentation regardless of how you feel about its overall game direction so far is still one of the very best in the industry but what do you guys think as Call of Duty finally caught up to Battlefield in the visual Department or is battlefield still several steps ahead let me know in the comments section and of course don't forget to Like
