welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to finally take a look at the recently released entry to the resident evil series resident evil village and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to the last mainline non-remake entry to the series resident evil 7. for this comparison both games are being played on a pc with their settings cranked up to their highest settings at a native 4k resolution however i will be disabling the motion board for cleaner image capture and i'll make use of the temporal anti-aliasing method without the assistance of fxaa as i feel this configuration provides an optimal presentation also before we get started bear in mind that due to the nature of resident evil games there are potential spoilers beyond this point i won't cover any of the big reveals of course so significant characters or features in the late game won't be used for the analysis but i will at least be showing various enemy types weapons and core gameplay mechanics that i feel probably represent the general feel of both titles the best also if you want to refresh our course on resident evil before hopping into the latest title be sure to check out my documentary on the history of resident evil which i've linked in the description below alright so let's kick this comparison off by first going over some of the character models starting with our lead protagonist ethan winters unlike most other resident evil titles both re7 and re village are played entirely from a first person perspective limiting the player's view of the lead character to just his arms and legs there's a few rare instances where more of his body is shown but there's never a time where his face is truly revealed that being said we can at least compare the player's hand models whenever a weapon is on screen for this i disabled the depth of field effect in re7 temporarily as it's much more aggressive in that game and will blur out ethan's hands with a disabled though we can easily identify an obvious increase in fidelity with re village with superior model geometry and higher quality texture maps you can now make out the folds in the skin on ethan's knuckles along with tiny hair follicles along the outside of his hand whereas in re7 the textures along his hands look flat and there's a very obvious texture seam along his left hand where the blood effect doesn't properly wrap around his thumb this increase to quality also applies to the weapon model designs too even if the guns themselves aren't technically the same the pump shotgun for example appears sharper in re8 and also sports a vented barrel shroud and an intricate inlay pattern along the metal receiver and wooden forehand it's a more interesting design choice that fits well with the game's new eastern european gothic setting but the improvement to the textured surfaces and the way that light reacts with the weapon helps to really set ari8 apart next there's one of the only other shared characters in both games mia mia has seen a few minor alterations to her character design since re7 she still strongly resembles her original design with her facial structure and complexion intact but there are some subtle changes incorporated that help to make her appear even more impressive this time around first there's her hair yes it is cleaned up a lot more this time around which makes sense in regards to the story but the actual fidelity of the hair itself is what i want to focus on here if you look closely at her design in re7 the strands of hair hanging over her shoulder move together in larger clumps with sharp angles being used to simulate curls it looks okay in motion but with re village these rougher edges have been smoothed out with individual strands being more easily identifiable and no noticeable sharp kinks though it's still not perfect with just taa enabled there's quite a bit of edge shimmering in this opening prolog sequence and the hair simulation could use further improvements down the road but even so it's improvement nonetheless mia also sports some higher quality texture maps and shader implementation most noticeable when looking at the surface of her skin there's a lot more nuanced detail along her forehead and cheekbones that was mostly devoid of detail before making her look more like a real person again it's all very subtle and i'm still impressed by how great she looks in re7 some four years later especially the quality of her scripted animations and the few scenes that you run into her but with all the improvements that have been made to the re engine over the past couple years there's no doubt that her latest appearance brings the series one step closer to that uncanny valley that the series seems to be aiming for other than mia there's no other side characters shared between both games at least none that i care to mention for reasons i mentioned earlier however there are still some characters that appear completely different that serve almost identical roles in the narrative the police officer in re7 and the villager in re village serve basically the same purpose at the start of the game as a tool to demonstrate to the player what type of horde that they're going to be dealing with only the quality of the animations and the incredible uptick to the level of detail of this old man in re8 greatly outpaces the design of the officer in re7 just look at the eyes and how you can actually see the concavity of his iris surrounding the pupil then of course there's all those tiny hairs along his face and the beautiful shader work that helps to realistically reflect the nearby light source the lighting and skin tone is not the same of course but you can certainly tell that the textured surfaces on this officer aren't nearly as crisp and the lighting doesn't really diffuse along the surface of the skin quite as realistically an even more obvious similarity are the key antagonists in the first acts of both games jack baker from re7 and the internet's favorite lady demetresque like before these characters look nothing alike but they still serve the same fundamental purpose in the game as they're typically invincible and will patrol key parts of the level environments forcing players to sneak by like with mr x vs nemesis that i mentioned last year these two enemies behave very similarly to each other walking back and forth along fairly simple pathing routines until they're interrupted by the player stepping into their cone of vision or triggering a loud enough sound however as odd as it may sound i feel as though jack is a much more effective design overall in theory demetreska's taller stature her sinister smile and her deadly wolverine style claws should make her a much scarier enemy and upon facing her for the first time she's certainly intimidating but something about the location that she chases you through really robs her of her potential even though she's technically over nine feet tall she doesn't really feel all that tall and menacing when placed in a giant gorgeously decorated castle foyer and because her pathing is so limited it's almost too easy to bypass her jack on the other hand managed to get the jump on me quite a few times when i replayed this game he's a really basic looking guy and there's nothing really that scary about him when taken out of context but the world he occupies does a much better job of throwing him at the player and the end result is an arguably more terrifying enemy which leads us to our next topic the environments the environmental design is a crucial aspect of any survival horror experience it can very easily make or break the mood that the developer is trying to convey and while yes resident evil village's environment doesn't necessarily lend itself to the same claustrophobic horror that we saw in re7 that's not necessarily a bad thing either because re-8 doesn't seem to be chasing after that same aesthetic you see resident evil 7 was built as a sort of soft reboot for the series abandoning the over-the-top action scene in re 5 and 6 to return to the claustrophobic dimly lit halls of the original game only instead of the marbled floors of the spencer mansion it's set in a rundown seemingly abandoned plantation house in the isolated bayous of the american deep south this semi-modern locale helps to drive home a more relatable horror experience kind of like the setting you'd expect in a slasher flick and the result is a fresh creepy location that feels remarkably unsettling to venture through resident evil 8 on the other hand reimagines the tense survival horror action of the fan favorite resident evil 4 with a return to its gothic horror vibe in an isolated european village set beside a massive medieval castle unlike re7 that takes place mostly within the baker mansion itself rv8 uses its outdoor village as a wide reaching central hub with lots of different unique huts to explore and enemy encounter sprinkled around them this area then branches off into four distinct zones that all offer their own distinct look and feel first there's the castle that feels reminiscent of your classic resident evil locale there's fancy marbled floors gilded halls and lots of fancy decor juxtaposed to the horrific discoveries players will make along the way further west is a remote cliffside manor that delivers a sort of similar feel to the baker mansion the architectural design is a bit more modern here and there's a much heavier emphasis on horror that re7 fans will appreciate the two southernmost zones the reservoir and the factory though are much more action-oriented with lots more enemies to contend with similar to the types of high-intensity combat found in similar locations in re4 there's just more variety in re8 aimed to appeal to every type of resident evil fan though the wider lanes higher enemy density and more over the top battles certainly leans more towards the action side of things as far as the quality of the environmental assets goes we once again can observe a pretty obvious win for resident evil 8 with sharper texture work and a lot more detail crammed into every corner of its much larger world i still think re7s baker mansion is gorgeously detailed and holds up remarkably well some four years later but it's plain to see that details like grass texture maps doors trees and other similar environmental props offer much more detail in real next up we have lighting the lighting is kind of the same deal re7 is extremely dark adding to its horocentric theme whereas re8's locations are typically brightly lit with the exception of a few interior spaces when the story calls for it i have no real preference one way or the other here i feel like the lighting choices work perfectly for each of their respective themes however the way the actual lighting effects have been implemented are no doubt superior in re8 to those found in re7 in fact i was pretty surprised by how poorly the lighting in re7 is aged it's one of the few aspects that really feels off when replaying it there's some significant color banding issues that i don't recall running into before that only seemed to go away after enabling the game's hdr settings and even after calibrating that properly things still felt weirdly off re-8 doesn't suffer from this problem at all however it's not off the hook as i noticed that the game's brightness when adjusted based on the provided calibration tool is still a bit higher than it probably should be you can see it a lot in this captured footage that re8 just looks more washed out on average so i do recommend carefully tweaking the setting without relying as much on the calibration image brightness settings aside r8 still features a lot of great improvements to its lighting design including superior subsurface scattering much better ambient occlusion liberal use of volumetric light shafts and the inclusion of some amd based ray tracing effects that more properly recognize ambient light sources to illuminate the game world there's also some improved reflective surfaces as well that are technically superior to the lack of reflections we saw in re7 though they're not great with really blurry projections that only appear at scripted moments and weirdly don't seem to match the fluidity of the scripted scene they're supposed to be mirroring there are a few instances of screen space reflections used in resident evil 7 but they're rare and they usually have a really pixelated look to them then of course we have our effects resident evil games lately have all had some pretty impressive effects implementation from nice fire propagation usually scripted to some fantastic over-the-top grotesque gore and while re-8 does feature these aspects still i feel as though the quality of its gore and really its physics overall is a bit of a step back enemies pretty much exhibit no physical properties when they die outside of some really cool ash particles that materialize to help them despawn re7 however does exhibit some ragdoll physics at least for its defeated enemies additionally re8 still suffers from the exact same re engine low rate distant animations when playing at higher frame rates which looks absolutely terrible in one of the later sequences because of the more claustrophobic level designs in re7 and the two remakes this issue wasn't nearly as obvious but with re8's larger scale it's pretty much impossible to ignore and moving forward i would really like to see this issue addressed for the engine especially now that target frame rates on the newer consoles are getting much higher now let's move away from graphics and go over some of the biggest alterations that have been made to the gameplay design re8 as i mentioned before returns to the first person perspective utilized in re7 the core gameplay loop revolves around environmental exploration scavenging for supplies and intense combat encounters with powerful enemies with a mix of puzzle solving and stealth action here and there it's extremely similar to how re7 plays only this time there's a lot more enemy variety to help keep the combat more interesting in re7 there's basically only six to eight enemy types in the whole game and even then it really just boils down to some inky mould monsters and the members of the baker family it works fine with the game's smaller scale setting but re8 does feel more ambitious by comparison with all sorts of variations of different creatures many inspired by gothic horror the most common enemies are the lykan a group of humanoid canine creatures that can run jump and dodge throughout the village in nearby ruins for a standard enemy these guys can be fairly challenging to deal with especially considering they often attack in packs and as the game progresses more formidable variations of them will begin to show up including some that wear armor plating to protect their weak points in the darker areas of the map like caves or cellars players will need to contend with the zombie-like moroica that are fundamentally similar to the mold creatures in that they're weaker and slow but they do also happen to wield sharp weapons and tools as well flying enemies also make a return and instead of being swarms of bees like in resident evil 7 they take the form of much larger gargoyle-like creatures called the samkha that patrol the skies and will swoop down to attack the player within the depths of the factory players will also have to contend with a number of frankenstein-esque cybernetic enemies usually equipped with protective armor to shield vulnerable weak points likely paying homage to the regenerators from re4 and if all that wasn't enough there's also a number of boss types to contend with like vampires werewolves giants and last but not least are yates lead villains the lords that rule over their respective areas of the environment much like the baker family did and like with the baker family each of these lords has their own special quirks making fighting each one of them a totally different experience that requires some sort of distinct approach though i do feel as though these boss fights are built much better than the ones in re7 there's a lot of different attacks to watch out for more so than any of the baker family members and the insanity of each of these battles feels large enough in scale to do each character justice to contend with these enemies players will need to gather quite the arsenal of weapons which can be achieved by finding money in the game world and spending it at a brand new merchant character called the duke that can be found in and literally around most safe rooms duke has a lot of things available to purchase in the shop there's basic consumables like health ammunition and throwables along with firearms made available at a steady pace throughout the story on top of this person can also upgrade each of their own firearms to improve their effectiveness and can sell found resources to earn back some cash this is a lot like re4's merchant however new to re8 is the ability to craft food items using various meat acquired from wild animals hunted in the open world areas each meal grants the player a specific permanent upgrade like increased health or movement speed much in the way the adrenaline shots work in re7 though there is a limited supply of animals in the game so players should be careful about which upgrades they feel like purchasing other changes include a new dodge counter mechanic that can be used to push enemies back if timed properly the return of the customizable inventory screen where you can freely move items in a grid and rotate them to make room for larger items and a plethora of new secrets to uncover often leading to a powerful new weapon or tool to make ethan's journey easier with all these changes coupled with the much larger level environments and the improved variety rates gameplay feels like a better realized action horror experience and its plentiful bonus content unlockable after completing challenges throughout a playthrough helped to give it a little bit more replay value too finally let's wrap up this analysis with a brief sound comparison which game do you feel has the superior music audio quality and overall design where the hell am i so foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] uh boom um see there you are and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall i'm extremely satisfied with what capcom has managed to accomplish with resident evil 8. while i'll admit i've always preferred the classic horror-centric tone of classic resident evil games over the more action-oriented style of resident evil 4 i do feel the choices setting enemy types and gameplay style all perfectly complement each other in resident evil village to deliver not just toward the sequel to re7 but a spiritual reimagining of re4 it's a brilliantly made game with great pacing beautiful visuals and an engaging gameplay experience all capped off with that quintessential resident evil borderline cheesiness that has helped the series persevere for so long it's certainly not perfect as there are some blatant performance issues on the pc especially during this combat sequence with one of the daughters in the castle that seems to be caused by the large amount of particles that flood the screen and those low rate distant animations really hurt what should be impressive sequences but it's otherwise a confident single-player experience that continues to build on capcom's consistently positive track record lately but what do you guys think are you impressed with resident evil 8 or do you feel resident evil 7 managed to accomplish more let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe
