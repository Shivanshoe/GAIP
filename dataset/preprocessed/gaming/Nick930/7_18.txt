welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to finally take a look at playground games recently released open world racing title forza horizon 5 and see how it's evolved visually over its predecessor forza horizon 4. for this video both games are being played and recorded on a pc with the graphic settings cranked up to their highest values at a native 4k resolution and the motion bar options will be disabled to capture the cleanest possible still images alright so to kick this comparison off let's start by going over the presentation beginning with the quality and complexity of some of the car models as you can probably already tell the design of these cars in both games is simply incredible there's an extreme amount of detail across every available vehicle in the game with considerably high poly counts for even some of the smallest details which is why it's not too surprising that the cars in forza horizon 5 really haven't received any substantial changes one way or the other of the four identical cars that i observed there wasn't a single detail that wasn't shared between both games down to the very same number of polygons on this tiny screw here when zoomed in significantly the only discernible difference that you've probably already picked up on is the lighting causing colors to appear duller and specular effects to be more prominent but this has more to do with the game's chosen environment than anything else which brings us to our next topic the environment design one of the most interesting aspects of any forza horizon game at least to me personally are the unique locations that you can drive across each entry in the horizon series has offered large wide open spaces with the freedom to explore and race across a large variety of interconnected tracks and circuits in horizon 4 players are treated to temperate forest regions in northern england with plenty of small towns farms and loose stone walls lining the roads it was a somewhat tame choice when coming from horizon 3's gorgeous australian-based level environments but it was greatly assisted by a new seasonal loop that saw the game world drastically change every week horizon 5 however drops players into the heart of mexico bringing with it lots of large deserts sunny beaches thick jungles and mountain ranges there's even some very cool ancient ruins sprinkled throughout along with lots of small towns that aim to celebrate mexico's unique cultural identity the map feels much more diverse overall offering drastically different biomes in each quadrant something that i feel horizon force map struggled with slightly due to the limitations of a uk setting along with this arguably more interesting map design forza horizon 5 also sees the return of seasons only they've been altered slightly to reflect mexico's much warmer climate instead of winter spring summer and fall horizon 5 seasons are dry hot wet and storm the difference between these seasons it's much more subtle altering the appearance of the lighting and increasing the chances of certain weather events to occur this includes typical rain storms gale force winds tropical storms and out in the desert regions massive sandstorms that can greatly limit visibility for players that like the snow the dry season does allow for more snow to blanket the mountainous regions towards the northern end of the map though this region is tiny relative to the rest of the game and there's only a handful of races that utilize it as far as the actual quality of the game world goes horizon 5 offers a ton more detail no matter where you look the ground for example utilizes more tessellation making the rocky deserts appear more three-dimensional it doesn't necessarily hold up when viewed up close but under normal racing circumstances it does add a lot more quality to the presentation other typical textured surfaces like rhodes haven't seen a big bump to their resolution quality which is a bit disappointing as it's one of the few areas that hasn't looked all that great but due to the nature of the game and the sheer size of each game world it's at least understandable why this compromise would have been made ryzen 5 does however offer a much higher density to its vegetation and dynamic object props most notably the various plants and trees on screen at any given time making the jungles and deserts really come to life in a way that the temperate forests and farmlands of horizon 4 didn't quite deliver now that's not to say horizon 4's game world looks bad necessarily it holds up incredibly well still but you'll find that 3d objects like grass and bushes do have a slightly lower draw distance in horizon 4 resulting in more apparent popping next we have lighting after going back to horizon 4 after several years of not really touching it i'm still blown away by how great it looks with some beautiful picturesque vistas showcasing hundreds of high-fidelity skybox presets that seem to blend seamlessly with cube map lighting across the playable space mix in the dynamic time of day lots of dynamic lights from things like vehicle headlights and the constantly evolving seasonal data and what you're left with is an extremely believable playground to barrel ridiculously expensive cars through now it's obviously not perfect the real-time cube maps on car surfaces don't hold up very well upon close inspection with lots of inconsistencies in the game world as expected the slightly more expensive screen space reflection technique is also utilized whenever there's bodies of water or puddles in the environment horizon 5 on the other hand manages to incorporate the much more impressive ray trace reflections at least when using the game's built-in vehicle viewing modes allowing players to capture some gorgeous still images that are technically not possible to capture under normal gaming conditions when actually driving around horizon 5 utilizes the same cube maps for vehicles and screen space reflections for bodies of water but there's no option to enable ray tracing there is technically a way to mod in the ray trace reflections but as it's not officially included in the game this won't be considered here as cool as it may be even without raytracing though there's still a few under the hood improvements that have been made to enhance the whole the lighting design most notably a rework to the way the global illumination is handled ensuring key areas incorporate proper bounce lighting more effectively add on top of this the return of some nice specular lighting improved ambient occlusion and shadowing all within an absolutely gorgeous tropical locale and horizon 5 ends up looking far more visually stunning than its counterpart which is quite the accomplishment considering how great horizon 4 still looks next we have our effects thanks to forza horizon's wild open-ended gameplay philosophy there are a ton of great effects to observe across both titles from the way snow dirt and water droplets accumulate across the surface of vehicles to the buttery smooth dynamic destruction incorporated in ways that while absurd still are executed quite well one of my favorite effects in horizon 4 for example is the way all the stone walls crumble into pieces when smashing through them it's a fairly simple physics-based effect but the sound and the many different pieces that fly across the screen all help it stand out considerably flattening fields of wheat and grass also look great and have thankfully returned the same with this latest entry though this is also combined with a lot more vegetation to smash through thanks to the rich jungle environments and numerous other dynamic props along the side of the roads the sheer volume of dynamic objects in the world at any given moment is incredible and a noticeable step up from the past entry and while there is some pop in out in the peripherals it's very easy to miss the other effects like water dirt buildup and various decals haven't really changed all too much which is to be expected considering it already looked pretty great before though i do wish moving forward that this series would begin to evolve the vehicle damage models to be more realistic because these games are built to be more casual racing experiences the cars even with the simulation options enabled barely deform at all they essentially swap between various presets depending on the velocity of the impact causing glass panels to crack and various dents and scratches to form it's the exact same damage effects we've seen in the series before which is a shame considering there's been several other racing games over the years that have managed to go above and beyond in this area still considering the game's target audience this isn't too big of a problem and it's also likely more of an issue with car brand licensing limitations as we've seen with other games in the past finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you feel sports the superior audio quality and design [Music] [Applause] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow [Applause] hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall forza horizon 5 is a visual marvel it was refreshing booting this game up after finally finishing my previous project and being blown away by not just the great visuals but some really solid performance to go along with it the forza series has been consistently impressive over the years constantly delivering beautiful scenery and realistic looking car models all with a fun and addicting formula that manages to keep the experience engaging for long stretches of time and thanks to new features like a revamped career mode new custom track editors and a ton of new activities to play with friends this may be one of the most ambitious forza horizon games yet there is always room for improvement of course i think the next step for playground games would be to further improve their global illumination technology clean up the object streaming and perhaps overhaul the damage models for vehicles i'd also like to see some official implementation of ray tracing without needing to modify the game itself and the textures while fine from a normal distance really don't hold up when viewed up close but it's still a solid improvement over an already visually impressive game and certainly worthwhile for any fans of the forza horizon series or even just a mild interest in racing at all but what do you guys think are you impressed with horizon 5 or do you still prefer horizon 4 let me know in the comment section and
