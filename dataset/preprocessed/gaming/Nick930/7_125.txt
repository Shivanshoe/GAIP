welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna take a look at code masters recently released a grid reboot and see how it compares to their last grid title from 2014 grid Autosport now of course these two games are separated by nearly 5 years of graphical evolution so we in theory should expect there to be improvements all around but the focus of this video is to highlight what exactly code masters have managed to change since then and how these changes impact the visual presentation of the experience before we get started bear in mind that both titles are being recorded on the PC with the settings pushed as high as possible at a 1440p resolution but the motion bar settings will be disabled for the sake of image clarity all right so to kick this comparison off let's start by looking at some similar vehicle models starting with the Subaru BRZ now of course it's important to understand that these are not the exact same vehicle the version used in the latest grid is likely the most recent iteration of the Subaru BRZ additionally it appears at this vehicle along with several others in the new game are now equipped by default with some racing body kit modifications and liveries that can't be changed due to a lack of any proper customization menu but despite this it's clear to see that the actual vehicle geometry used is nearly identical to the ones in grid Autosport everything from the rear panels up to the hood match up almost exactly except for of course those additional body kit mods what's even more interesting though is that when zoomed in grid Autosport appears far less blurry the tail light for example appears a bit crisper in auto sport with the less aliasing around the border this is even more noticeable when looking at the headlights that appears so low res that it's impossible to distinguish some of the finer details that are very clearly visible in grid Autosport grid 2019 makes up for this though with a much more advanced cockpit view that no longer blurs the dashboard like before this seems to be the case with all the similar vehicles that I could find between the two games with less aliasing and higher res details in Auto Sport the plenty of new body kit mods improved reflective surfaces to paneling and a new cockpit view in grid 20-19 environments on the other hand have seen a drastic improvement in the latest game road surfaces now sport much higher resolution textures has two patches of dirt and grass object models like traffic cones and barriers are now made up of more polygons and various decoration around the track has been enhanced with more detailed structures vegetation and improved dynamic turf effects when driving through grass the crowds also appear significantly better now thanks to an increase in size variety and overall complexity when viewed up close it's clear just how poorly Autosports character models hold up against the much more detailed models in grid 2019 the newer models still aren't great but they sport more facial detail higher res textures and more complex geometry the full effect of all these environmental factors help to drastically improve the presentation of the latest game and the addition of things like dynamic blades of grass that blow in the wind really helps to sell the immersion better one of grid 20 19 s biggest improvements though is to its lighting design lighting feels far more natural in this latest title with more biometric properties especially when interacting with smoke from vehicles more believable bloom implementation some decent reflective surfaces and an overall more realistic looking presentation grid Autosport lighting feels incredibly outdated with static effects and vehicles that essentially feel superimposed onto pre lit backdrops this design allows the bright colors of the vehicles to pop more because of that increased contrast but it doesn't look nearly as realistic as the lighting used in grid 2019 where the reflective surfaces along vehicles help to diffuse the color slightly align them to feel like they're generally a part of the scene this also applies to nighttime races where tracks now feel properly lit and taillights give off a more distinct glow in Autosport distant lights would just appear as bright yellow glares all roughly the same size but the latest grid now features improved distant light rendering that more accurately shows how different sized light sources and intensity would be visible from far away shadows have also seen some solid improvements there's less visual banding now and there's softer of shadow projections along with real-time rendering of environmental shadows on smoke effects created by the player and other vehicles next let's take a look at our effects starting with damage models damage effects have been improved a great deal on the latest grid game with tiny pieces of pan being ripped away before ultimately falling apart this effect presents itself almost immediately after impacting with the track walls and other vehicles though in grid Autosport the effect is much more subtle scratches will appear but the vehicle seems to maintain its general shape more that is until damage done to the front bumper where the entire front end can fall off very easily additionally tires seem to get damaged more easily in Autosport making the vehicle more difficult to drive there was some pull in the latest grid after multiple collisions but overall I was still able to easily control the vehicle so while the damage looks more impressive in the newer grid game its effect on the gameplay seems minimal in comparison to auto sport despite the damage settings being maxed out in both titles grid 2019 also introduces weather effects which don't appear to be available at all in auto sport though that being said the rain effects aren't all that impressive and grid as the options are severely limited and water droplets don't even seem to impact with the windshield in the cockpit view still it's a nice addition and does add a bit more variety to the overall package finally let's listen to a few sound comparisons which game do you think has the better overall sound design [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's go get coffee [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall grid 2019 is a definite improvement over all to sport Auto Sports vehicle models may have some nice details when beat up close but 20 19's improved environmental complexity superior damage effects and vastly improve the lighting really stand out grid certainly has a long way to go before it can compete with the likes of Forza project cars or even comb asters other titles like dirt but it's still nice to see the series make a return and hopefully if Codemasters does plan on continuing the series we may see an even more impressive iteration with next-gen hardware but what do you guys think do you think grid 2019 s visuals are an improvement or deeper for the design of grid Autosport let me know in the comments section and of course don't
