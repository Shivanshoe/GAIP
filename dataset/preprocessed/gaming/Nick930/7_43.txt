welcome back everybody i'm nick930 and in today's video i'm gonna bring you guys something a little bit different with some extended cooperative gameplay footage of capcom's recently released switch exclusive title monster hunter rides for those of you not quite as familiar with this game monster hunter rise is the sixth mainline entry to the popular action role playing game series where you track down ferocious monsters and fight them using a variety of big weapons and items and then use their hides to craft even cooler gear to fight even more ferocious monsters the game just released for the nintendo switch and introduces a number of great new gameplay mechanics to the formula including the wire bug that adds in more verticality to the traversal while simultaneously speeding up the feel of the combat and the power mutes which are essentially big dogs that you can ride around like horses who will also fight alongside you what's more you can also invite up to three other players to play alongside you cooperatively which makes the many different weapon types even more important as you work to configure your loadouts to maximize your effectiveness but the series is not necessarily known for its accessibility with its complex series of menus and controls making it come off as a bit too daunting to newcomers thankfully with monster hunter rise capcom sought to address those concerns and have implemented some clear menus expanded tutorials and several new mechanics to help streamline the feel of the gameplay so in today's video i want to put ryze's improved accessibility to the test and invited two of my friends to join in on a couple of the game's early quests to see if we could successfully bring down some monsters without losing all of our pooled lives in the process to be clear both guests have never once played a monster hunter game before and for the remainder of this video i'm going to show off the results of the experiment and explain some of the things that we learned along the way with the hopes that when you decide to pick up this game you'll be better prepared to take on monster hunter ryze's deadly creatures i hope you guys enjoy this gameplay and our interesting tactics and if you do be sure to leave a like and comment below and let me know if you'd like to see more content like this in the future alongside all my regular content as well additionally i want to thank my guests bananadude64 and forgivenjohn316 for joining me on this hunt and if you'd like to check them out they both live stream on twitch and you

set off just get ready you can check your gear and your chest you can also go to the canteen and get some food does the food uh give us anything yeah you can order a bunny dango and they should give you uh benefits oh this is gonna make me hungry oh look at this they're cooking my food in japan they have cats that cook right i've never been to japan so i can't confirm either way i'm ready to depart whenever you guys are yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and grab some gear before we head out from the supply box make sure you do the same i took all of our stuff i'm out i don't even i don't even know how to check my inventory to be honest your inventory is in the bottom right corner hold l and then you can tap y or a to swap through the items oh gotcha all right uh we got one of our creatures right here oh easier i don't think that's the right monster oh no that's that's not one of our things let's it's on my marker or one of my objectives there's a it's a bad honey badger right there my dog is just attached to it right now [Laughter] oh i'm just i'm getting pummeled hey make sure you back up and heal if you need to we do share lives so if you die then we only have like two eyes left man i feel like these dual swords are barely doing any damage on this guy i think this guy's weak spots behind him getting a lot of damage on the back all right let's go let's go you know what i guess i could attack him with my doggy boy let's ride pal so i keep mauling at him i'm attacking him with my dog oh he backed it up if you get knocked down just get up again you're never gonna keep you down i was gonna say hold lz and then tap x and you'll zip away using the wire button oh gosh jeez we might try to run [Music] he's running for it yep heal up before you go also check your weapon see that mine's at all about to be orange it's still got a sliver of yellow yeah you're going to want to sharpen it i i would but i'm fighting i didn't let him get away i said hey not not today but honey badger let's go let's go let's go oh oh oh these other creatures are attacking my dogs i think those other creatures the ones we're actually supposed to be fighting that's actually part of our objective oh yeah probably where you go is he running again let's go [Music] oh we can't oh he's gone going oh i just come back come back honey badgers back oh oh no he's mauling me he's smalling me help me oh get me out i fainted i fainted i tried a zipline out i'm back i'm back that was terrifying wait is this another monster oh they're about to have monster brawl oh that means we can ride one of them i got it i got the wyvern that's awesome that actually that's so cool oh my god i got thrown hard oh one shot you're about to go down oh he flipped over he flipped over oh get him attack his belly this is our chance this is our chance i'm taking some awesome pics right now dude we're fighting a monster here you're taking pictures of this i got like the cutest pose too like it's gonna be so good ow i'm i'm over here just chilling don't don't you come mauling at me again [Laughter] oh faded again i was not paying attention to my health oh okay i gotta heal up but we're gonna die no oh gosh wasted all our lives yeah that was all me i'm so sorry y'all quest failed well granted we didn't do any of what the quest asked us to do yeah we went straight to fighting the monsters right i'm going to gear up again from the item box i can upgrade my sword increase its attack damage oh this is if you follow the bridge in the village it brings you to a training area i wish that i knew that i could have been pushing x and a together for a combo flurry yeah so we definitely should have come here first [Laughter] all right we're all set i'm good to go we only have to hunt one creature i think it's the one you were riding earlier too all right off we go looks like we got two monsters right in the middle ooh perfect if we trigger them i think they'll hit each other oh no i hit the wrong one are either these are targets yeah this one's the bird one the big one to the back yeah the bird will they actually kill themselves you know kill each other yeah what they'll do is they'll stun one and then you can grab them and ride them now when you're when you're riding it what does that give you the benefit just to target wait what i'm writing why am i writing the bird thing because i stunned him now you could use him to fight the other guy but i don't want him if you press y you'll launch him and they'll do a lot of damage there you go uh oh whoa oh oh oh that's not good all right the bear is running away honey badger come back we need you okay fellaini fellaini phil now he's going to do that sprint oh if you do mid air attacks it does a lot of damage yeah that's why you want to use your uh wire bug you can grapple up and then do a downward thrust on them ah let me try that oh he broke something on him yep definitely broke something oh my gosh oh no oh geez yeah but you guys gotta go all right i'm good ah oh there's the monster oh he was ready for me yelled right in my face let's go oh he's getting mad oh he's limping he's almost dead let's go oh he just went yeah come back here no he's going back down he's going back down let's go he's coming towards you banana dude oh that timer doesn't look good no it does not it does not look good where is he wait isn't this him sleep he's sleeping right here i'm staring at him sleeping right here in front of me oh yeah he's right here yeah yeah me too no sleeping for you yeah nice i sent you guys some likes hit it a couple more times make sure it's dead i'm just gonna go and carve out its heart make sure it's dead i got his flame sack nice i got a scale got a flame sack he probably got a lot of good stuff from that probably did i just don't know anything about it so oh look at me i'm petting my dog he did such a good job and there you have it overall i think it's pretty clear that monster hunter rise is plenty accessible for newcomers to the series we may have gotten a little bit distracted on our first quest but even so we had a lot of fun playing through this game together and despite the impromptu barbecues and photo sessions we still managed to somehow take down our target without losing a single life at the end so thank you all for watching and again i want to thank capcom for
