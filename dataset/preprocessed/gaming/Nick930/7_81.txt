welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released skateboarding video game skater xl and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to the current early access build of creature studios session for those of you unfamiliar with these two titles both skater xl and session are highly realistic skateboarding sims that aim to capture the feel of real life skating with complex twin stick controls and authentic board physics unlike the popular tony hawks pro skater games the focus for these titles isn't on pulling off huge combos or running through a checklist of challenges to complete but rather exploring sandbox locations and experimenting with the game's free form control schemes the general feel of the skating is similar to ea's skate series but again with a more realistic sensibility and while both of these games may look similar on the surface they do differ in some fundamental ways for reference both games are being played on the pc platform with the graphics settings pushed up as high as possible at a 1440p resolution and it's important to understand that both titles are very much works in progress with sessions still being in its early access phase and skater xl only just this past week releasing into its 1.0 version so any bugs wonky physics or other issues i might point out may end up being fixed in the future alright so let's kick this comparison off by looking at the presentation starting with the quality of the character models now i'm gonna preface this section by first acknowledging that both titles need some serious work when it comes to the design of the skaters themselves not only are there barely any customization options available but the options that are available feel unfinished in lackluster skater xl's default character looks incredibly strange with some serious disproportionate limbs and awkward fitting clothes the character's face would be tolerable if he didn't have these crazy eyes and a locked facial expression that never changes even after he smacks his head into the concrete meanwhile in session the only available male face to tweak looks like chris angel for some reason with what looks like eyeliner applied around his eyes though i will give credit to session for at least getting the rest of the body right with some great looking arms and hands along with some decent texture work for the clothing still both session and skater xl would greatly benefit from more customization options especially more clothing and more freedom to customize the character's facial features on the bright side both games do a great job with the lower half of the skater mainly the feet and the skateboard itself they both feature some nicely detailed shoes many of which are modeled after real-life brands and the deck graphic textures are all high res with plenty of variety though it is worth mentioning that session skateboard model is a little bit more impressive with higher poly counts for the wheels superior texture resolution for the grip tape and some white screen space reflections applied to the metal trucks now let's check out the quality of the environments from a technical standpoint sessions environments are far superior to the ones featured in skater xl everything from the asphalt roads the sidewalks brick walls and tree trunks all are much higher resin session even the grass that really plays no role in a skateboarding game other than to indicate a play boundary is fully detailed in session with thousands of blades of grass all with varying coloration to help it appear more naturally while in skater xl grass is represented by a simple low-res texture map with a few sparse grass objects scattered throughout i think one of the most impressive models in session though are the guard rails that not only reflect light more believably but also feature an impressive amount of detail that far exceeds the quality of the textures used on rails in skater xl and while i can spend all day pointing out how much better certain objects look in session i have to admit that skater xl's level designs are far more enjoyable and more interesting to explore both games feature a very small list of maps to skate in each to ride from a single u.s city session for example features five maps each based around new york city these levels are mostly dense city streets with lots of rails curbs and small kickers hidden throughout and while it looks much more realistic these locations really aren't all that fun to skate in skater xl also features only a handful of maps five of which are created by the development team while three more were created by the community these levels are typically much larger and seem to feature a bit more variety including a high school downtown los angeles and even a massive mega ramp out in the desert there's a few dull levels mixed in but even these seem to have a more consistent flow to them with plenty of room to take advantage of the game's complex control scheme sessions levels are a lot more claustrophobic by comparison with smaller rails to grind on and more narrow ramps and it really limits what you're able to do with the tools given next up we have lighting here we have a pretty clear-cut win for session lighting in skater xl is all baked in and static with some all-right coloration along with some occasional specular effects in bloom but nothing else is really noteworthy meanwhile session features a full day night cycle with some great volumetric lighting effects and fantastic use of screen space reflections the result is a world that feels more realistic and the ability to manually adjust the time of day to suit your own preference is a great touch that players interested in creating things like skate videos or high quality screenshots will no doubt appreciate the skater xl can look great at times with light that seems to wrap around the character model realistically but the coloration just feels off and you'll frequently find that things like white clothing reflect way too much light next we have shadows now because session has a dynamic time of day in place i fully expected the shadow quality to be superior in skater xl but once again it does seem that session has the upper hand in this field shadows are darker more detailed and more complex than any of the shadows in skater xl though the shadow rendering distance does appear to be greater in the latter game visually i think it's pretty clear that session has a bit of an upper hand but let's shift our focus now to talk about the gameplay starting with the skater movement and control now if your only experience with skateboarding video games in the past has been the tony hawk's pro skater series then both session and skater exile can feel pretty overwhelming performing simple tasks like owieing or grinding are much more involved and will take a bit of practice in both games to really get the feel for it first there's the basic acceleration and steering in both session and skater xl players can kick off the ground either with their front foot or back foot using one of the two face buttons on the controller this is necessary to maintain speed and players need to carefully monitor their stance to avoid pushing but that's where the similarities end as steering in both games is handled a little bit differently in its default settings session requires players to use the rear triggers to steer the board as opposed to also offering the option to steer with the left joystick like in skater xl you can always swap to a mode called legacy in session settings that makes the left joystick steer and right joystick control tricks but this mode has a few compatibility issues and doesn't appear to be the intended method for playing so how about performing a basic ollie in session aveyang requires coordination between both joysticks to execute to initiate it players need to first hold down on the joystick that controls the skater's rear foot and then flick up on the opposite joystick which will kick the front foot forward and lift the character into the air this motion is similar to how a real-life ollie is performed however it doesn't feel very intuitive when translated to the joysticks considering the controls are turned at a 90 degree angle to the board on screen you can simplify the controls by switching the input mode but no matter what it will take some time to get used to skater xl on the other hand makes owieing a little bit simpler to perform an owie in this game all you need to do is push downward on the left joystick and let go to pull off an even bigger ollie you can hold down both joysticks simultaneously and let go as opposed to session where higher jumps require the player to hold down the rear foot for longer the ollies in skater xl while easy to perform are kinda ridiculous the player is able to jump what feels like six feet into the air from a standing position giving you plenty of time to perform crazy complex tricks session is a little bit more realistic with much shorter air time and a lower maximum height but it's still pretty generous the spins are also handled similarly between both games after performing in ollie players can hold either the left or right trigger to rotate the character in the air however i think skater xl pulls this off a little bit better than session with much cleaner animations that appear more natural and fluid you'll notice that even the board will bend independently of the trucks depending on the angle that the player lands at which looks way more realistic than the incredibly stiff landings in session after mastering this players can then move on to performing more complicated flip tricks which like the ollie are a little bit more involved in session in session flip tricks by default are triggered by first holding down on the rear foot stick and pushing both sticks in specific directions performing a pop shuvit for example requires that the rear foot be rotated 90 degrees either left or right which is then performed after using the front foot to kick up into the air skater xl however feels much more free form instead of offering specific button combinations to perform set moves skater xl lets you freely kick the board around with both joysticks and the moves are called out afterwards depending on how the board ends up spinning in the air this design feels much more intuitive and easy to pick up though it does look extremely goofy kicking your feet around with lots of hang time and it breaks the immersion quite a bit next we have the manuals to perform a manual in either game you need to gently hold forward or back on the corresponding joystick depending on the skater's current stance if done properly the character will begin to bounce on only two wheels for as long as the player holds the joystick steady this is an ok design though i found it to be incredibly inconsistent in both titles as the sweet spot to trigger the maneuver feels incredibly small though session does offer an option to adjust this threshold to make it easier additionally the animations for sessions manuals look much better than the ones used in skater xl as the board will actually lean left and right and move up and down based on the direction the players are moving next we have our grinds and slides this is probably where the two games differ most when it comes to the controls in session performing a grind is a lot like performing a flip trick in order to pull off a specific trick you need to jump on the rail and hold down the corresponding joysticks in specific directions i get the idea behind this as you would need to put pressure on certain parts of the board in real life while performing a slide but it feels a bit too involved for its own good especially when compared to the much slicker grinding mechanics in skater xl in skater xl all you need to do to pull off a board slide is to jump over a rail and rotate the board so that it lands perpendicular it's incredibly satisfying and i found myself repeating the same lines over and over again just to experiment with it you still need to hold down on the joysticks for certain grinds like five-o's and nose grinds but it all feels intuitive and i never found myself awkwardly bailing just for trying to jump up onto a rail like in session again you can simplify the grinding in session through the menus but even on the easiest possible settings it's not nearly as smooth and responsive as the grinding in skater xl next we have vert and grab tricks now this feature appears to still be in very early development procession so there's not much that can be said about that particular title but skater xl's current grab and vert system could benefit from additional tweaks as well to perform a grab players need to jump in the air and press either the two shoulder buttons along with a corresponding joystick direction to choose a spot on the board to grab it's plenty intuitive and works fine but i feel like the grabbing animation is far too stiff and unnatural when compared to the excellent flip tricks and grind mechanics doing something as simple as a kickflip to indy just feels forced and i would love to see the rough edges in this transition smooth out a lot more even going vert feels a little bit awkward i frequently found myself flying over the coping and off the deck into space while other times i would awkwardly get locked into a blunt or a rock and roll when i didn't want to when it works it looks great though there's also a number of instances where the camera will clip through the ground and it just feels unfinished in session you'll barely even get up onto those ramps the maximum speed is so incredibly low that i often found myself just barely getting enough momentum to reach the coping another major difference between both games is the off board traversal in session if you press the y button on the xbox controller you'll dismount from your skateboard and you can walk around freely perfect for positioning yourself for a new line but in skater xl there's no way to get off the board however if you press y you'll instead be given an even more convenient map screen where you can easily select the location to drop your character instantly without any load times at all it's not quite as immersive but it gets the job done much better and allows you to reach some truly ridiculous skate spots if you want it's also worth mentioning that the start point and resets are much nicer in skater xl as they function instantly as opposed to in session where you're stuck holding down a button and waiting for the game to load your reset point finally let's wrap up with a quick sound comparison which game do you think has the superior audio design [Applause] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall it's kind of a toss-up both games have some distinct advantages and disadvantages session is clearly aiming to be hyper realistic with a ton of complex controls and higher quality visuals but i do feel it's a bit excessive at times and it takes away from the fun of the experience skater xl on the other hand has a more limited feature set but some great controls that led themselves to a far more enjoyable experience grinding and pulling off flip tricks feels great and the design of the level environments lend themselves better to pulling off lots of cool tricks whereas in session the levels can feel a bit too realistic and the lines aren't quite as obvious the session does offer a lot more creative control over the gameplay with lots of control modifiers time of day settings and even the ability to drop in extra ramps to tweak the environment further again both games still need a lot of work especially with the character models and liveliness of the environments but they're at least both fun to mess around with and i personally found myself wasting lots of time just roaming around the parks and discovering new lines to master but what do you guys think which of these two skating sims do you prefer or is there another skateboarding game series you enjoy more let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more videos posted every week
