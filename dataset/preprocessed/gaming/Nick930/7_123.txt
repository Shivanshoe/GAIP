welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode I want to revisit a pair of World War 2 tactical shooter games that I covered last year hell let loose and post scriptum as both games have received a number of pretty significant updates with new maps factions weapons and other important features that I feel married and updated comparison additionally I want to explore the actual gameplay features this time around including how things like movement combat and team play mechanics differ between the two games for reference both games are being played on the PC platform with our settings running at the highest values and II 1440p resolution and the motion bar setting will be disabled to capture cleaner screenshots all right so to kick this comparison off I want to revisit one of my bigger complaints in my previous comparison regarding the design of the weapon models mainly the m1 garand in my previous video I noted how the m1 garand and post scriptum featured some high resolution details and a more authentic manufacturer label on the receiver hell let loose on the other hand was sporting the incorrect label of the m1 garand type that wasn't in production until after World War two but instead of changing this it appears helmet looses new depth of field effect that can't be disabled in the game settings blurs the receiver completely making it impossible to read now this also seems to have affected the soldiers arm that previously looked great but now appears more like a low resolution texture due to this blurry depth of field implementation meanwhile post scriptum as weapon models look even cleaner than before and the pinging sound effect that I noted for being missing previously can now be heard more clearly when the player empties the M ones clip overall the weapon models now appear to be superior in post scriptum than the models used in hell at loose and are improved further by more authentic ballistic physics and weapon sway effects that i'll expand upon more in a bit next let's talk about environments here we see another major improvement for post scriptum as various ground textures and objects have seen a significant bump in quality since last time in fact some of these textures are even better than in hell let loose especially trees and grass though other surfaces like sandbags and dirt do appear a bit more detailed in the latter game another complaint I had regarding post scriptum last year was its interior environments and mainly how empty various structures were around the map but with post scriptum x' newer chapter 2 maps this issue appears to have been addressed with more building interiors featuring things like tables cabinets and chairs to help make the environments feel like a real place but these improvements are still minor when compared to the already superior interiors used in how let loose that feel like actual lived in structures next we have the lighting previously I noted that post Krypton's lighting was more dynamic with more volumetric properties and superior gadre and bloom implementation this appears to still be the case though post scriptum lighting has been improved even more with a West washed-out tone that provides a more colorful presentation helmet loose on the other hand hasn't benefited from as many improvements lighting does feature more volumetric properties this time around but there's also the strange glitchy looking Sun that seems to be stretched out across the sky the lighting effects also still appear more static with only a few preset lighting conditions available per map though the nice rolling cloud shadows that I noted before do still appear to be present additionally how that loose seems to have added in player cache shadows something that was missing previously though they're still not quite as clean as the shadows used in post scriptum other than that the visual designs of these games haven't changed much with the same explosive effects and general aesthetic so instead of retreading the same ground I want to cover in detail some fundamental gameplay designs that separate these two games starting with the general movement and combat mechanics both games on the surface handle as you'd expect you can run sprint crouch lay prone and vault over obstacles however post scriptum does impose a limit to how frequently some of these actions can be performed by means of the stamina meter stamina will deplete for actions like jumping or sprinting and will deplete even faster if the player tries to sprint while in a lower stance having depleted stamina can slow the player down and even affect their ability to aim steadily to refill it players are encouraged to rest or drink from their kids canteen now what loose doesn't feature any sort of stamina meter players can sprint as much as they want providing a more consistent pace to the action however the movement doesn't feel quite as smooth as in post scriptum vaulting feels clumsier and the lack of an ability to sprint while prone or free look while running does make the action feel less immersive next let's talk about the feel of the combat if you didn't already know both post scriptum and hell at loose or World War 2 tactical shooter games this means there's a super load time to kill and much less forgiving combat mechanics and while both games aim to deliver the same type of experience they both feel drastically different when it comes to their combat post scriptum has a much weightier feel to its weapons repositioning your aim for example will cause the weapon to sway and aiming-down-sights is a bit slower making it difficult to pull off quick shots with something like a bolt-action rifle in helmet loose the weapon handling feels far less natural there's almost no weapon sway and repositioning your aim is more stiff like a traditional shooter game when firing you'll find that posts kiptyn's weapons are harder to control was significantly more recoil to contend with however assuming your first shot is aimed properly the weapons are also incredibly accurate making long range engagements surprisingly effective helmet loses weapons don't suffer from nearly as much recoil but feel much less accurate I found myself mean to unload several rounds of enemies at a pretty short distance before they would stop firing back especially with the Thompson SMG though scriptum also handles its ballistics more realistically with the projectile system that requires players to account for distance in bullet drop helmet loose on the other hand uses a modified hitscan system instead with an artificial bullet dropped bullet deviation and travel time to simulate the feel of a projectile system while certainly not the most realistic choice helmet looses modified hits can still works just fine benefited further by the increase in close range engagements and it does appear that the developers are still looking into improving the ballistic design in the near future overall the combat design of post scriptum is designed to be more authentic with a slower pace and higher difficulty curve helmet loose however is much more forgiving and built with more standard shooter mechanics in order to emphasize its objectives and team play next let's look at how both games handle health management as with most tactical shooters taking incoming gunfire is often lethal if you do happen to survive you won't be able to run around a corner and wait for your health to reset players in both he'll let loose and post scriptum are required to treat their wounds with bandages to stop the bleeding a lengthy process that will leave the player vulnerable to a follow-up attack however post scriptum takes this a step further and requires players who are injured to seek out a combat medic in order to fully replenish their health just like with the stamina and slower ABS speed this system of healing makes for a slightly slower pace discouraging players from rushing into combat without proper support medics and helmet loose only seem to be effective at reviving down teammates a feature that is mostly the same between the two games except hell let loose revives take longer and don't cause the brief IED player to stand up incorrectly abun revived assuming you managed to survive incoming fire without taking any direct hits you'll suffer from a suppression effect in both games inhale let loose incoming shots landing near a player will cause the player screen to darken and the weapon to swing a bit in the center of the screen and post scriptum however incoming fire darkens the screen almost entirely and causes the player's weapon to shake out of control making it very difficult to return fire this again seems to be a design choice intend to make the experience more immersive and encourages players to engage moreso in guerrilla warfare rather than direct firefights like in hell let loose alright so now that we have a clear understanding for general combat and movement field let's talk about the structure of the team mechanics both post scriptum and health Atlas are built heavily around specific roles and classes each designed to accomplish a specific goal on the battlefield the first role and arguably one of the most important is the team commander the general idea behind this role is the same in both games one player on each team can apply to be the commander and can communicate directly with the rest of the team squad leaders to coordinate team movement and provide air support however the method for calling and support is handled a little bit differently in post scriptum the commander needs to be standing near a functioning radio in order to call and support for their team help loose on the other hand is a bit more lenient and commanders can call and support anywhere on the man assuming that they have enough supplies to do so the squad leader for both of these games also functions similarly in that they can deliver orders to the squad mates and receive orders from the commander correctly in a private voice channel squad leaders can also construct spawn points something that has handled very differently between the two games and post scriptum squad leaders can place down something called a recall point that can only be placed when standing near a radioman squad member hello lose drops the requirement for another player to be nearby and simply requires that the squad leader have enough team resources in order to construct a spawn point helmet loses squad spawns are some of the most common in the game and because they're not quite as temporary players can get back into the action more consistently delivering a more constant pace in post scriptum more spawn points can be created via the logistics team that can either resupply the frontlines and build forward operating bases or reposition mobile spawn point trucks both of which are essential to the success of a team how Atlas has introduced its own variation of this by means of the engineer class but rather than mean to drive vehicles back and forth the engineer simply needs to build resource nodes to gather resources for a team automatically these resources can then be used to construct various structures and can supply the commander with the ability to launch airstrikes outside of the logistics and engineer classes there are several other standard infantry classes to choose from including riflemen medic anti-tank and machine gunner though post scriptum does have a few more to choose from including the radio men to different 80 classes mortar and the marksmen hell let loose does feature its own marksmen like class but they operate in their own unique squad type called recon that consists of a spotter and a sniper perfect for providing long-range support without taking up a valuable slot in a standard infantry squad and then there's the armored units that in both games are the only members of the team capable of controlling powerful tanks on the battlefield in post scriptum crews are made up of four members each with a crucial role in operating heavy vehicles there's the driver the main cannon operator the machine gunner and the tank commander that can pop in and out of the top hatch to spot targets for the crew some tanks and post scriptum can only be operated by three users but the general idea is still the same inhale atlas tanks are all controlled by only three crew members the driver main cannon operator and tank commander the machine gunner role is given to the driver who can aim the turret using a rectangular HUD element in the corner of the screen while this seems like it's simplified the armored units a bit more the tanks and helot loose are much more challenging to control thanks to the awkward gear shifting mechanic built-in additionally tinks and he'll let loose seem to get stuck more often especially when trying to cross over dirt mounds on the side of the road making them much less practical than the tanks in post scriptum finally let's wrap up with a follow up sound comparison which game do you think features the better audio design now [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall based on my experience playing through these two games it's a very clear what direction the developers are going for post scriptum is a game built to be as authentic as possible with stamina that can be drained more difficult to control weapons more complex logistic features and significantly larger Maps how that loose on the other hand is more forgiving to new players combat is more frequent weapons handle like most shooter games and the general gameplay mechanics like healing resupplying and setting up spawn points are simplified a great deal they're both great tactical shooter games that do a decent job of delivering a more deadly take on report 2 though it's important to understand how these games play before deciding on which one to pick up so what do you guys think which of these two tactical World War 2 shooter games provide the best overall experience let me know in the comments
