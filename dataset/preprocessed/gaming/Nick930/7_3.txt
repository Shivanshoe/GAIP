welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna look at rebellion's newly released third person shooter game sniper elite five and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to the previous entry to the series sniper elite 4. for this analysis both games are going to be played on the pc with their graphic settings cranked up to the highest possible values at a native 4k resolution though the motion bore options will be disabled in order to provide cleaner still image captures alright so let's begin by first looking at the game's presentation starting with the quality of the game's lead playable character carl carl has seen some considerable improvements in this fifth outing his facial geometry has been enhanced a great deal adding more subtle muscle definition around the eyes nose and mouth his hair also looks less like a plastic hairpiece with individual hair follicles visible near the top of his head and a clearly visible five o'clock shadow along with smaller details like dirt smudges that can be seen under his right eye the textures are the real takeaway though as every inch of the model now features high-res texture maps that hold up great when viewed in 4k that being said 085 still feels like it's far behind when it comes to its character model designs overall carl his allies and his enemies all have a very unnatural look to them a big reason for this is the way the game's baked lighting effects react to the characters faces there doesn't seem to be any implementation of subsurface scattering here so what you end up with are harsh shadows hiding important details around the eyes and nose another thing that seems to hold the sniper elite series back are the animations like with elite four the fifth entry makes use of a combination of both keyframed player animations throughout the course of normal gameplay and more advanced motion captured animations for its cutscenes even though there have definitely been some improvements they still feel remarkably dated when compared to other more modern third person action games the player movement in particular feels incredibly clunky with sudden directional changes feeling awkward and difficult to control stealth also feels too restricted and takedown animations aren't nearly as smooth as other games in this genre but for the sake of keeping the focus on just these two games yes all these areas have technically been improved upon carl's walking and crouching animations in particular look much better especially in regards to camera orientation and the character's movement direction next let's talk about the environments in sniper elite 4 players embark on a string of solo whops in and around the northern coastline of italy in a big departure from the designs of previous sniper elite games the fourth game introduces much larger sandbox style level designs with multiple objectives offered to the player and the freedom to approach these objectives in any way that the player wants this means if the player needs to assassinate a nazi general they can search around the environment to find a convenient vantage point nearby or they can move in for a close range kill instead it's a lot like io interactive's popular hitman games with distinctive levels each with their own unique layouts objectives and lighting conditions sniper elite 5 on the other hand takes place in france prior to the allied invasion of normandy it too offers several large sandbox style map designs but strangely these levels restrict the player a great deal almost every location seems to funnel the player through distinctive paths separated by impenetrable hedgerows fences and structures elite four did suffer from this to some extent too but instead of relying on flimsy vegetation walls the pathing was broken up by cliff edges and other more convincing barriers as for the visual quality of these environments sniper elite 5 is unquestionably a step up with beautiful high-res texture maps and superior geometry for just about everything and thanks to upgraded tessellation effects the worlds of sniper elite 5 have a much more perceivable depth to them whereas the previous game often appeared relatively flat the only thing that really holds sniper elite 5 back and sniper elite 4 for that matter is its lighting design in either game the lighting is entirely baked in each level has its own set time of day that will remain static no matter how long the player spends sniping at targets there's a few instances of volumetrics at play mainly with the sun as it shines in through windows or around clips but they aren't quite as clean as they could be with rough edges that detract from an otherwise nice looking scene but i was surprised to find that there are a few lights that can be shot out in elite 5 and will appropriately remove the surrounding ambient light attached to that light probe 085 also improves on its reflection properties as well with better shader work and specular lighting applied to surfaces that seem to reflect the sun or moonlight along with higher resolution screen space reflections that reflect more of the environment than the same kinds of puddles in sniper elite 4. the shadow projections have seen a few improvements as well including higher res shadow maps for character models and static environmental props however i did encounter one odd bug in sniper elite 5 where zooming in will actually remove the player's shadow altogether whereas this was not the case in sniper elite 4. then of course we have our effects sniper elite 5 actually does a great job with its various effects fire from destroyed vehicles and the occasional campfire are much more detailed with superior flame alphas and a large increase to the ember particles floating above explosions are similarly more impressive with high quality smoke plumes and again high-res flame alphas but the water was what really surprised me water has now been modified to be very dynamic and will realistically react to the player's movement it would have been nice to see some shader work applied to the character models to show that their clothing has been soaked but just to see the water surface react at all is a huge improvement over sniper elite 4's very generic water splashes so overall as far as the graphics are concerned elite 5 is a pretty solid improvement in most areas the character models look much better the environment while more limited is still more visually dense and many different lighting shadows and miscellaneous effects have seen some solid upgrades so now let's turn our attention away from the graphic side of things and see what sniper elite 5 changes in regards to its gameplay starting with the available game modes this is probably one of the more impressive aspects of sniper elite 5 as i was genuinely surprised when i booted up the game and found such a large amount of content for such a seemingly small game not only does elite 5 have a full 9 mission long campaign experience but players can also team up with a friend and play through it cooperatively or group up with a squad of 4 and defend against waves of nazi soldiers in a survival mode on top of this elite 5 also sees the return of its competitive player vs player mode that while a bit dated in its overall design is still pretty enjoyable when combined with sniper elite's unique sniping mechanics additionally this pvp mode offers full cross-play support which is a great addition considering how small sniper elite 4's pvp community was when it first released but one of my favorite new modes brand new to elite 5 is the invasion mode where players can directly invade another player's single player campaign assuming the role of a german sniper this completely turns the standard formula on its head as the host player suddenly goes from being the hunter to the hunted and must carefully navigate the mission without being seen by both the invading player and the rest of the ai soldiers to help find this opponent players can make use of one of the many telephones located throughout the map that will ping the approximate location of the enemy for a short time the catch is that once a phone has been used a cooldown begins before any of the other phones can be used again if no phone is used by either player for long enough then both players positions will be pinged simultaneously forcing an inevitable confrontation what i really like about this mode is that it's not quite clear who the enemy is there's no name tags or distinctive appearance for the jaeger sniper as the player can choose from a large selection of different models and accessories smart yeager players can even attempt to blend in with the ai soldiers as they make their way to an ideal position forcing the host player to carefully scout out the area and identify their target it's an asymmetrical battle of wits and it's probably one of the better implementations of an invasion mode that i've seen in a while as for the actual gameplay mechanics themselves sniper elite 5 makes several small changes across the board to try and build on the formula traversal for example now includes the ability to climb up netting and vine covered walls or quickly descend using muddy slopes and ziplines all of which add greatly to the game's verticality weapon handling has also seen some big changes with a larger selection of different ammo types accessible through the player's expanded weapon wheel a new active reload mechanic similar to the popular gears of war series and the ability to aim down sights for all weapons in a first person viewpoint allowing for more precise aiming no matter what weapon that the player is using interestingly sniper elite 5 limits the player's ability to swap weapons on the field making every enemy weapon only a temporary pickup unlike before where players could freely swap out their primary or secondary weapons however they like thankfully players do still have some freedom when it comes to loadout customization thanks to both the pre-mission setup screen and the new workbenches found hidden throughout each of elite 5's level environments by accessing these workbenches players will be rewarded with additional weapon kits that can be used to modify each of their weapons including barrels stocks scopes grips and pretty much anything else you can think of sniper elite 4 has weapon customization too but it's much more limited in that it only offers passive buffs to weapons like damage and accuracy improvements after completing specific challenges on a per-weapon basis alongside the conventional firearms players are also treated to a selection of various tools and gadgets as well while grenades teller mines and explosive satchel charges make a return the popular s mines and trip mines are absent and are replaced by decoys and the non-lethal shoe mines along with these mines players can also now non-lethally dispatch enemies using a new knockout close quarter attack or alternatively they can fire at weapons using soft round ammunition both of which will reward the player with bonus xp at the end of the mission like before players can whistle to draw in their prey but the unlimited rocks from sniper elite 4 have been replaced by a new bottle system instead which limits the number of ranged distractions players can make likely to make close range stealth more challenging overall by doing this long range engagements may seem like the more practical choice and for the most part this is the case thanks to the new warning indicators over enemy heads that will give the player a clear idea of whether or not an enemy will hear a shot if fired from that position however because of the more linear environments i mentioned earlier i do feel as though the freedom to snipe targets has been limited a great deal and doesn't have quite the same sandbox feel as sniper elite four finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you feel offers the superior audio quality and design [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall sniper elite 5 is a solid improvement over the previous sniper elite 4. not only are the graphics a noticeable step up but all the changes built into the gameplay helped to better streamline the action providing players with necessary on-screen information to better explain the rules of the sandbox without completely breaking the immersion for players that do want a more hardcore experience many of the ui elements i mentioned can of course be disabled but being able to see when a long range shot will trigger a full scale alert i feel is a nice touch and makes sniping a much more appealing option in the game at the same time i do wish that elite 5 had taken more lessons from sniper elite 4 when it comes to its level designs as i feel many of the missions in this latest game are too restricting and aren't as much fun to explore as a result but what do you guys think are you enjoying sniper elite 5 or did you prefer sniper elite 4 let me know in the comments
