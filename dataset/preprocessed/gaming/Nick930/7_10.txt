welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take another look at the recently released horizon forbidden west and see how its final retail release has evolved since last year's state of play gameplay demonstration for this analysis i'll be playing forbidden west on the playstation 5 running in its 4k fidelity mode to ensure the highest possible quality though bear in mind that while we will be taking a look at some visual elements like textures characters and object models the footage on the left will ultimately look more blurry at times due to its video compression so the primary focus for this video will be more on the environmental layout mission structure gameplay mechanics and the overall design now before we get going here i do feel it's important to clarify that the entire mission shown during the demo last year is not actually included in the final game every cut scene every surprise reveal and every enemy encounter shown is done so purely for the showcase and while there are some similar events that occur throughout the course of the actual game they don't happen in this location or even with the same characters that being said the path taken by the player in the demo can be very closely replicated in the retail build so we can at the very least try and retrace steps and piece together how this location has been modified so let's jump right into it with our introductory cutscene of a soldier awakening in the jungle surrounded by his fallen comrades as he comes to the game's protagonist eloy appears on the scene providing the soldier with aid and pressing him for information about her missing friend aaron not only does this cut scene not exist in the final game but there doesn't seem to be any instance in the main story campaign where aaron is kidnapped by raiders and requires rescuing as for the actual background scenery being shown here i was surprised to find that the environmental design of this area remains somewhat intact using the game's photo mode i was able to position the camera in roughly the same position as that initial pov in the jungle and after tweaking the time of day and bumping up the overexposure option to 1.5 it starts to look a bit more recognizable every bit of vegetation shown in this frame is still exactly where it was including the purple flowers the ferns the palms and all the moss lining the jungle floor and while there's of course no fallen soldiers or lit fires here you can actually still see the burnt grass from where those flames used to be suggesting that this was definitely the area that they used to script out the demo you've also no doubt noticed the dramatic change to the game's lighting resulting in a very different look and feel with tone down bloom and saturation likely in an attempt to make the colors look more realistic then we have our first close-up look at eloy this is of course a fully animated cinematic being shown demonstrating the more complex character animations that are featured prominently throughout the course of the actual game but i was surprised to find that the incredible level of detail shown in that cinematic can also be found on the in-game character model as well by positioning aloy in approximately the same location as the demo and again tweaking the lighting a bit you can see the similarity in detail with things like the individual hair fibers the subsurface scattering and even the reflective eyes teeth and the peach fuzz lining the side of her face however the retail game does appear sharper in general both in cut scenes and in game and while ailoy's cheeks can at times look about as wide as they appear in the demo her default resting face has been slimmed down to bring it more in line with her appearance in the first game additionally this particular armor worn in the game now comes with some more detail by means of the decorative paint designs along both of alloy's arms following this cinematic eloy then walks underneath an old overgrown machine and into our first glimpse of actual gameplay now despite the environmental layout still matching up almost exactly we can observe a very clear change to the game's lighting here by using the angle of the volumetric god rays shown here i manually adjusted the time of day to try and match it as close as possible but due to the increased density of trees to the right the sunlight no longer pours in as much at the specific time of day however by reversing the direction of those light rays to the early morning hours you can still observe a lot of the nice effects being shown like the silhouette of that old street light and the green glow of the tree leaves as light passes through them even some of the weird volumetric artifacts are retained where certain object models seem to be weirdly poking through the light rays and causing some unusual shimmering though despite some similarities eloy still seems to have much less indirect lighting applied to her character model regardless of what time of day is set moving on a little bit more we get a better look at this waterfall as aeloy passes over it using a fallen tree this is the first area where we can definitely observe a drop in quality as the water rapids here utilize fewer alpha effects than what was previously suggested and the areas where the water supposedly flows downward look more angular and unnatural now as opposed to before where you couldn't really make out that underlying surface space other than the waterfall and its connecting river the whole of this environment remains surprisingly consistent save for a few trees that have been added to some areas and removed from others the biggest consequence of this change is that this particular spot in the demo used to reveal the large wide-angle view of the ruins of san francisco is now almost completely blocked by this one tree canopy which i find odd considering what it's blocking still looks nearly identical one possible reason for this change is that the impressive reveal is actually used in a separate sequence shortly after discovering the island where a large storm bird is scripted to fly over the player as they discover the city the sun wings seen flying here in the background do occupy parts of the island as well but they just aren't flying circles around the downtown area as suggested in the demo as aeloy moves onto the beach there's a few more noticeable albeit minor changes that have been made some of those decorative ruined structures and walls sticking out of the sand have been swapped out with more barnacle ridden walls instead likely to cut down on the need to render more complex shadows with the broken windows shown before you'll also find that the lighting isn't quite as bright and vibrant despite the time of day being set in a way that ensures the shadows are in the same positions changing the time of day to an earlier time does allow for more vibrancy with some white sand rich green palms and blue water but even then the demo had a much more vibrant and colorful appearance as aeloy proceeds across the flooded street corner we get to yet another cutscene this time revealing a pack of new machines called clawstriders these machines are featured prominently throughout forbidden west but this particular variant does not appear at this location this area instead plays host to a more deadly fire based claw strider that will roam around further down the street they are not controlled by any rebel forces though rebels can be found riding them further inland complete with their own custom regala paint job interestingly this cinematic in the demo also seems to suggest that this is the first time aloy has ever seen an enemy riding a machine however in the final game eloy discovers this much earlier long before the player is able to reach the san francisco island location after this cutscene ends alloy is soon after detected by a free-range clawstrider she dodges an attack churns and fires an arrow only to be stunned soon after she then drops a smoke bomb instantly confusing the enemy and runs into a nearby ruined structure in the final game this scenario won't present itself as there's no patrol route for any nearby claustriders that brings them through this building to the side however all the attacks and evasion methods demonstrated are still available in the final game and function the same as what was shown after avoid escapes that first claw strider she then turns the corner into another fires an arrow and continues to flee she veers off the path and up a collapsed roof and then leaps off of a palm tree onto a platform below now while a fire claw strider does occasionally walk up onto this roof here the chase behavior demonstrated isn't nearly as aggressive in the retail build they'll definitely pursue the player but they're more prone to losing track of them if they manage to break the line of sight this means that they won't follow aloy into this church using a separate opening and then attempt to climb the ramps as the player scales the central pillar this isn't too surprising as i felt this was easily one of the most scripted sequences of that demo considering the enemy seemed to patiently wait for the player every step of the way though i do believe that the intent of the scene was to add an exciting element around the demonstration of aeloy's new traversal maneuvers including the ability to vault over low objects the ability to use the focus to pulse for usable hand holds and the new free climb system all of these mechanics are present in the final game and are used heavily throughout though the vault and jump maneuver shown here isn't nearly as fluid as the delay between the vault and the jump aren't as seamless and the role performed as abloy hits the ground causes the player to leap much further forward likely a change made to make combat throughout the rest of the game more manageable as for the environments here there's again only minor changes these coral shelves for example have been removed from this barnacle-ridden wall and instead of a completely flat surface transitioning to the grass field near the church the retail build has a slight gap in this corner requiring the player to make a small jump i also noticed that in these few frames you can actually see the edge of the playable area used in the demo as there doesn't seem to be anything past that pile of rubble but in the retail build you can see past these distant objects revealing that the demo was more than likely a vertical slice of the game that was only expanded upon following the showcase moving into the church ruins we can spot a few more changes first a new hiding place has been added near the base of this first pillar and then there's the lighting that's not quite as bright as it was before despite the time of day still lining up almost exactly it appears there's less global illumination in the retail build with areas in the corners and opposite direct light being hidden in more shadow than before and with the change to the coloration i mentioned previously it just feels less vibrant as a result after being spotted again avoid vaults up onto the pillar using the free climb system and then using the new pull caster device zips across to a nearby beam and then quickly dives off into the water below all these actions can be replicated in the final game and aside from the enemy placement and the lighting that i mentioned before it looks more or less the same too it's not until we arrive to the underwater scene that things start to change drastically after diving underwater the demo reveals a gorgeous underwater coral reef filled with brightly colored undersea life brought out further by a luminescent blue glow but in the retail build no matter what time of day is selected it's impossible to generate the same results this location is much darker now with the details along either side of the reef hidden in shadow and while most of the detail remains intact there are a few coral shells still missing once alloy resurfaces we're greeted with a vibrant view of the ruined church window and the nearby structures as two burrowers paddle in the distance burrowers can swim just like this in the final game they just don't have any patrol routes around this area and while all the decorative objects like vegetation coral and high res textures are retained the difference in the saturation is made clear once again as the bright blues and greens now sort of blend together resulting in a much less vibrant but arguably more realistic appearance there's also a little bit of detail added to the scene as well like the small metal window frame sticking out of the water to the right and the addition of white foam along the surface of the water after spotting the burrowers alloy dives back under the surface and slowly swims through the coral reef because this location is now much darker the bioluminescent coral lights up even more brightly here starkly contrasting with the rest of the scene after passing through this undersea archway aeloy then swims through some thick seaweed at the edge of the reef and stops to watch as a large snap maul swims past this same snap mall is still present in the area but if you check its routine pathing it now only swims counterclockwise as opposed to clockwise like before once it passes ailoy swims out to the edge of the reef towards a yellow ledge here there was a lot of activity with large schools of fish swimming in the distance significant plant life and a strong current moving in the direction of the church but in the retail build there's no current these currents exist in the game but this particular one has been removed though otherwise with the exception of some removed decorative seaweed this undersea area remains mostly the same after her swim alloy then surfaces near the side of a building and pulls herself back up onto the beach there's a few more changes that can be found here for one the water surface has more white foam to account for the increased wave activity and alongside the building itself you'll find that the vegetation has been replaced with some concrete rubble though you can still see some of the older assets hidden behind after vaulting over another fallen tree we get to this gorgeous wide angle shot of the wrecked plane sitting atop a distant waterfall you'll notice in this same scene with the time of day tweaked to try and line up as closely as possible that the retail build is considerably darker trees and vegetation on either side of the frame are hidden in shadow more whereas in the demo there was a blue tint that helped to illuminate some of this additionally the bloom used to accentuate the cockpit of the plane has been removed and it's difficult to even see the cockpit itself without changing the lighting completely however there have also been some more details added here including more vines dangling over this building's facade along with additional trees growing through the top as aeloy proceeds forward a third cutscene triggers this time revealing rebels dragging aaron through the woods who are also accompanied by a massive robotic elephant called the tremor tusk that knocks down several trees in its way again the mission is not in the final game but it is interesting to see that signs of its existence do remain as the trees that the tremor tusk knocked down are still knocked down in the final retail build once they pass aeloy then follows them into another beach area where a few enemy rebels can be seen on the beach below staying hidden she veers left and through a broken window and then into some tall grass to get a closer look in the final game there's no rebels here at all which at this point is to be expected but strangely the window here has been sealed off as well as the structure has been replaced with a different building entirely blocking off a portion of the tall grass that can still be seen inside once aloy reaches the edge of the grass she comments about the tent on the far side of the beach being eren's despite the same ruined tent still being in the final game there's no indication in the game itself that aaron has ever stayed there and interestingly the blue cloth canopy off to the side has been changed from a striped blue to a striped orange pattern perhaps in some early attempt to associate it more with aaron's outfit of choice another key takeaway here is that some details have been removed there's less rocks at the edge of the water here and the wooden planks while still present seem to have sand covering most of them now from here the demo highlights aloy's new melee combat mechanics including a new silent takedown animation some spear combos and a new enemy grapple animation courtesy of the heavily armored axe wielding enemy here after being thrown down eloy then uses a valor surge electric attack to stun the attacker and then proceeds to latch on and detonate a resonator blast every one of these moves has been included in the final game and seem to function the same as before after the skirmish eloy continues her hunt for errand finding more traces of the tremor tusk in the nearby overgrowth before turning towards a winding river cleverly disguising san francisco's iconic lombard street remarkably this area has retained all of its rich detail which was so impressive before that i fully expected to see a lot of that vegetation toned down but instead we see a few more details added in like this metal plating on the ground at the start of the path and while the lighting still doesn't match up quite the same it does look fairly close this time after taking in the sights eloise then rushes up a metal ramp on the left side pulses her focus and then zips across the river below using her polecaster she then walks out to a nearby overlook and spots the ruins of the old golden gate bridge just like the big wide shot revealed from before this scenic overlook has been blocked partially by some repositioned vegetation but aside from this one tree and some ferns that have been removed off to the side this area still looks about the same eloy then jumps down and makes use of her new shield wing to glide safely to the beach below again a feature in the final game as well once she reaches the beach she then sprints and slides through the sand kicking up dirt as she hides in the nearby tall grass she then moves to another set of grass closer to a wild claw strider now unlike the church area from before this old shipwreck location has absolutely no spawns for any type of machine so while you can override clawstriders and use them as mounts it's just not possible to do here for the sake of consistency i've called in my own mount for this particular sequence as aeloy emerges with her clawstrider mount into this next beach location you'll notice some odd red vegetation off here to the left this is a key part of the game's narrative as aoi must stop this red growth from spreading throughout the world but as this particular issue should be resolved by the time the player reaches this island it's no longer visible here anymore though it can be seen often in the first few acts of the game finally we reached the absolute biggest change here the big fight with the tremor tusk it no longer exists in the game at all at least not this specific fight on the beach the tremor tusk itself can be found in a few locations throughout the game but these particular war equipped tremor tasks appeared to be limited to missions mainly this one earlier in the game as this was the only time i recall ever having a chance to fight one thankfully fighting a tremor tusk does seem to function mostly the same as what was shown all of the same weapons attacks and weaknesses are all included and the way it smashes through the environmental props is consistent with how other large machines can destroy pieces of environment as well which brings us to what actually roams this area in the final game instead of a tremor tusk this beach now plays host to a new deadly machine called the slaughter spine it's a similarly challenging fight to the tremor tusk though this enemies attacks are a bit different but i was pleasantly surprised to find that the tremor tusk's laser attacks that were shown to create trails in the sand do still function the same way in the final release as seen here in this desert region following this big showstopper of a fight eloy regroups with the now rescued aaron who reveals that he has found what she's been looking for she takes the device and activates it revealing a map of the united states and some mysterious pinged locations on it the camera then cuts to reveal a massive red storm cloud over the golden gate bridge serving as a cliffhanger to the end of the demo like with the red plants shown earlier this red storm cloud is in the retail game but it's not really shown in this location either for the same reason as before and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall while i'm certainly disappointed they didn't incorporate at least some similar mission into the game to take advantage of this particular path i'm happy to see that every actual feature demonstrated has been properly integrated into the final game what's even more impressive is that the overall visual makeup of the game looks very close to what we were promised sure the lighting has been changed some enemies have been moved around and there's a few small environmental props that were either relocated or cut entirely but there's also other areas where things have actually been added to and improved upon and overall i'm very impressed with the outcome of this game's final presentation but what do you guys think are you happy with the final retail build of forbidden west or are you disappointed by something that was cut out let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more videos like this
