welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released crisis remaster and see how it compares visually and from a gameplay perspective to crytek's original pc version of the game released back in 2007. now for this analysis both games are being played on a pc with each game's settings cranked up to their highest presets at a 4k native resolution however i will be disabling the anti-aliasing for both titles to help save on performance along with the motion bar options in order to provide cleaner still images alright so we're going to kick this comparison off by first taking a look at a few of our character models starting with the members of raptor team in the opening cinematic now right away we're going to notice some pretty big changes to both the character models and the atmospheric lighting that impacts the look of them jester here for example is cast more in shadow than before so a lot of the details that were so easy to spot before are not quite as pronounced you'll also notice that each character model in these cinematics sports an identical amount of polygons and you still get these unnatural straight lines that create the curvature of their heads the lighting in general certainly appears more natural here and diffuses with the skin properly though i do feel that the repositioned light sources feel inconsistent and hurt the original look of the scene especially in this shot where the light is coming from the right rather than from the left now the one thing that i will say has most definitely improved are the nano suits the suit looks fantastic now with lots of crisp details and textures that help to clean up the really boring look of the suit before even psycho's weapon here features more polygons giving details like the scope a more rounded realistic look however just like with jester psycho's face seems a little bit off the stubble of his beard isn't as nosable now and he seems to lack any sort of depth with the new lighting method not creating the same bright angles and shadows as the lighting method from the older cryengine build it's even worse with this nanosuit helmet where the new carbon fiber texture just looks like a blurry mess as opposed to the crisp look it featured before however it is worth mentioning that on the island itself the nanosuit visor actually looks much better and sports what looks like real-time trace reflections though i still found that in each and every cutscene the facial models look worse than before and this is odd because the in-game models actually look pretty good this enemy soldier for example has much better shading and textures for both his outfit and his face and the same is true for the members of raptor team the few times that you see them so it really just seems to be the way they're rendered in the cutscene cinematics using the new cryengine lighting next we have the environments this is of course one of crisis's strongest assets as its beautiful ling shan island locale is loaded with plenty of tropical eye candy and while the remastered certainly improves some aspects of the island's appearance there's a few questionable changes mixed in take these rocky cliff faces at the beginning for example that before featured lots of complex geometry shadowing and high quality textures but now appear mostly flat with reworked shadows that do a bad job of hiding the objects clipping through each other this can be observed with every cliff face in the area and it stands out pretty badly and even had me going back into my graphic settings just to ensure that the settings were still set to their highest values there's similar downgrades all throughout the game especially to the chunks of trees and other dynamic objects though thankfully this isn't always the case there's still quite a few areas where the remaster does look better the ground textures for example all look fantastic with much higher resolutions and better shadowing that give it a more photorealistic look there's even a few upgrades to some of the object models like this barrel that has received all new texture maps along with new reflective properties to help it blend more naturally with the game world but it's the new extended draw distances that really help the remaster stand out objects and vegetation are now rendered from much further away allowing players to view distant buildings and clusters of trees that previously were completely invisible i also found that the distant mountains look much better than they used to with more complex geometry along with more trees and bushes to hide those ugly bare spots from before this area in particular perfectly demonstrates just how much better the remastered's environmental lod looks with a lot more dense vegetation visible along with new volumetric clouds that provide an extra layer to the scene that just wasn't there before but even if you did have a powerful enough pc capable of running the game with all this extra detail it still doesn't change the fact that the remaster's lighting effects just look a bit off the game's coloration looks more stylized now with an excessive amount of color and bloom that ends up taking away from the original's more photorealistic approach now the actual techniques used to create the lighting effects are certainly more advanced thanks to the latest version of cryengine crisis remastered makes use of a more advanced global illumination which in theory should allow for more lifelike behavior of the game's lighting effects but the end result feels overly vibrant and unnatural instead and the beautiful orange sunrise in the game's opening mission now has an entirely different coloration to it that doesn't at all match the game's original art direction it's not all bad though the new lighting does make the image pop more on the screen with volumetric effects and post processing helping to separate distant landmarks to simulate the extreme distances the overlook point in the second mission for example feels much more grandiose than before with the light design helping to separate different sections of the scene more believably i just wish they hadn't gone so overboard with the saturation and given the world a more natural color tone to make up for this crisis remastered does feature some interesting ray tracing implementation including a few instances of ray trace reflections especially for the polished interior force as some of the larger structures i also found that the visors on the nanosuits and the windshields of some of the vehicles also feature similar raytrace reflections as well but surprisingly the surface of the larger bodies of water that surround the island do not use raytraced reflections and seem to instead use screen space reflections though because of the way the water moves in the game it's kind of hard to notice either way next we have shadows the shadows like a lot of the other changes throughout this remaster are a bit of a mixed bag the player shadows look great with much cleaner edges and more detail visible like the top rail of the player's assault rifle but environmental shadows like the intricate palm leaf projections cast by moonlight look a little bit off now it was never perfect in the original with plenty of differing but i feel the softer projections were more convincing then as opposed to now where the shadow looks weirdly pixelated i've also found that in some levels the main light source has been repositioned resulting in a slightly different look for some of the more iconic locations then of course we have our effects probably one of the more impressive aspects of crisis's visual design so first let's talk about the water as i mentioned before the water surface seems to be using some type of screen space reflections which is already a big step up from the lack of reflective surfaces used before but the water simulation effects have also been tweaked making smaller ripples more frequent though considering this is a much larger body of water i think i prefer the larger waves used previously as water now looks a little bit flat by comparison this would be fine if it were in a lake or something but it just doesn't look right in the scene what's even worse though is the underwater effects white previously would pour in through the water surface and cast shadows of the ripples on the ocean floor and while the remaster still does this the shadows look terrible and the volumetric lighting used to simulate that underwater look seems to be missing making it feel more like the player just fell through the map the explosions on the other hand do seem like an improvement as the explosive blast not only features a higher res fireball new smoke effects and increased particle density but the force from the explosion interacts more believably with the dynamic props in the world causing pieces of this house to fly in every direction rather than just clumsily falling straight down the big chunks of metal flipping around in the air still look a little bit ridiculous but it's an improvement nonetheless the same can't be said though for the game's dynamic vegetation this has always been one of my favorite effects in the original crisis where you can shoot any tree at any point and it will collapse realistically with its palm leaves hitting the ground and folding out of the way as they should but the remaster doesn't quite get this right you can still destroy most of the trees in the game the same way as before but for some reason all the vegetation physics seem to have their animations locked at 30 hertz resulting in a jittery mess whenever the tree collides with the ground i also found that enemies don't impact the vegetation as frequently when they walk through it now and when they do the vegetation is again really jittery an even more drastic downgrade comes with the way things like this wood fence break apart rather than breaking apart into tiny pieces based on where the player fires their weapon the fence now comes apart in big pieces cracking in places far away from where the player actually shot finally let's listen to a brief sound comparison which game's audio design do you prefer [Applause] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall crisis remastered is a disappointment sure the nanosuit looks nicer there's a few new ground textures thrown in and the lighting effects are technically more advanced but almost everything else feels like a big step backwards the level geometry is less complex the coloration is less natural there's some major bugs with the game's destruction and underwater lighting and worst of all the performance is atrocious with the settings cranked up to their highest values at a 4k resolution i was averaging well below 30 fps bordering on unplayable and while i appreciate the nostalgia of tweaking the settings to get the game to run well just like i did back in 2007 the game's overall visual presentation doesn't really justify the performance hit this time there's no legitimate reason for the game to run this poorly considering the quality of shooters we've seen since 2007 and cranking up the lod just feels like poor optimization design rather than a genuinely impressive technical feat i would have much rather this remaster have just fixed the original's reliance on a single cpu core and thrown in a few high-res textures and retracing options but instead we have this remaster that somehow looks less believable than its predecessor from over 13 years ago what's worse this remaster even removes a lot of important gameplay features including the ability to lean the option to toggle suit abilities using a comma rose and even an entire level towards the end of the game where you control the vtol in a huge aerial battle over the jungles on top of this you can't even create manual saves anymore and other options like the originals multiplayer mode are not included in its current state i simply can't recommend this remaster of crisis it's an interesting test of cpu power with its extreme draw distances but when compared to the original release of the game i'd argue it doesn't even look quite as good with the crisis series having been on a long hiatus since its last entry i was really looking forward to a return for the series's graphical showcase potential but i think this remaster needs a lot more work before it gets to that point but what do you guys think were you impressed with this remaster of crisis or do you prefer the look of the original game let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more videos
