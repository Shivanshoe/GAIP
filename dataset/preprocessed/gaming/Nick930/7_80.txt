this video is brought to you by amd welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take an in-depth look at the upcoming release of horizon zero dawn for the pc and see how it compares to the original ps4 release for those of you unfamiliar with this title horizon zero dawn is a third person action adventure game where you explore a beautiful post-apocalyptic world where robotic creatures have become the dominant species the game was widely praised for its breathtaking visual design and unique ideas and has become one of the playstation 4's greatest achievements but now over three years since the game first released the title is coming to the windows platform allowing pc gamers to finally experience alloys adventures at beautiful native 4k resolutions unlocked frame rates and various other improved visual effects so today i'm going to try and break down all the changes that you can expect when it releases on friday and how the game's performance varies across several different hardware configurations to give you a rough idea of how it'll run for reference the original playstation version of the game is being played on a playstation 4 pro and is being captured with a 4k capture card while the pc version of the game is running at my monitor's native 1440p resolution with all the visual settings cranked up to their highest values however to improve image clarity i have disabled the motion bar option and while both games are being outputted at a different resolution the main focus for the sections covered in this video will be on general asset improvements new effects performance and any other issues i ran into while testing the game alright so let's kick this comparison off by first looking at our character models starting with the lead protagonist eloy now if you've already played the original game on ps4 you probably already know just how incredible these character models look especially avoid and even after all these years it's still one of the most detailed character models i've seen on the platform the character model appears to have been ported over directly high fidelity and all though unfortunately there does seem to be an issue with the field of view controls in the pc version's photo mode that makes it more difficult to get some of the same close-up angles and because of this those higher res textures for extreme close-ups are much more difficult to trigger and while the difference in the main output resolution may seem like the obvious culprit you can clearly see that the high resolution textures are still there only you have to manipulate the camera very carefully to get them to pop up so knowing this let's disregard any super close-up comparisons for now and instead focus on objects at a regular distance where you'll notice that the model complexity and texture quality should match up exactly this is both good and a bad thing as there are a few models i was hoping would see an improvement on the pc especially the robotic creatures whose intricate details don't hold up as well when viewed more carefully they're still great and creative designs and because the game is played in third person you'll pretty much never notice these muddy textures outside of the photo mode but it would have been nice to see some newer high-res texture maps thrown into this release of the game next let's check out the environments the environments in this game are gorgeous with huge draw distances dense foliage that reacts to both the player and the great wind simulation system and some excellent high resolution texture mapping applied to practically every surface everything from the rocks the ground and the trees all feature a ton of depth and the pc version carries this all over great again just like with the character models there doesn't appear to be any new textures applied to any of the surfaces and the amount of vegetation has not been increased in any noticeable way but there has been some adjustments to the object draw distance the game's draw distance as i mentioned before was already pretty decent and i never noticed things like pop in on the ps4 pro version of the game but with the pc that distance was pushed out even further allowing things like this yellow tightrope to appear from much further away you'll also notice on a few distant surfaces like cliffs and boulders that new details are visible and the other less appealing texture work that was on the ground before has also been touched up as well additionally the pc version also features improved foliage animation made possible by amd's tres fx technology that in combination with the smoother frame rates allows things like grass and alloy's hair to move more believably as opposed to the clusters of grass moving a single units like before next up we have lighting now here the difference is pretty negligible i use the game's photo mode quite a bit to adjust the time of day settings to line up identical scenes but the general lighting method used has not been changed you'll still get that same great warm color tone with harsh pink and reds during the sunrise and sunsets along with that eerie blue and green tin at night underneath the moonlight it's a highly stylized lighting design and one that features a bit too much lens flare at times but for the most part it looks fantastic and i absolutely love how the light will bounce off of certain surfaces realistically and pass through others like tree leaves and clothing one change that has been made to the lighting though is the improvements to the screen space reflections because of the randomized cloud patterns it's a little difficult to match the scenes up exactly but a lot of the reflected objects i focused on have a high res reflection along the surface of rivers and lakes now it's not a huge improvement but it's an improvement nonetheless next we have shadows this might be one of the more noticeable visual improvements that have been made not only do alloy and other character models show much cleaner and detailed shadows but the environmental shadows also render at a further distance this coupled with the better ambient inclusion helps to make the objects throughout the world stand out against the background more and the world itself just feels more detailed as a result next we have effects with the effects i noticed very negligible improvements throughout the game the fire effects for example feature maybe a few more particles than usual and you'll probably notice some high res sprites used for dirt when it's kicked up during interactions with robots but i did notice a nice tweak to the water simulation possibly one of the weaker effects in the original release the surface of the water not only features improved reflections as i mentioned before but it also sports high res textures used for things like the white foam along the riverbanks and you'll also notice new splashes appearing around rocks along with additional shader effects applied to boulders to make them appear wet but all these visual changes are incredibly minor when compared to the pc version's best new feature the unlocked frame rate thanks to the power of the pc platform horizon zero dawn can finally break free of its locked 30fps and it runs well over 60 fps now the game looks incredible like this and all the gameplay animations including alloy the robots and environmental effects like grass and water have been updated to reflect this smoother experience i did notice a few instances of the character dialogue animations coming out of sync and looking like they were still running at a locked 30 hertz but this appears to have been an unintended bug that the development team is aware of to give you an idea of the game's overall performance i tested horizon zero dawn running on several amd powered builds using a range of different gpus and i'm impressed with the results on average the radeon rx 5600 xt paired with a ryzen 9 3900x managed to pull off an average of 51 fps at 1440p with the graphics all cranked up as high as possible moving up to the 5700 xt the results improved even further with an average of 65 frames per second oddly enough with the radeon 7 i also acquired an average of 65 fps in the benchmarking tool but when actually in game i found the frame rates to average a little bit higher and with fewer instances where it dipped below 60. now typically i like to feature a sound comparison at this point but because both versions appear to feature identical audio i'm going to instead show you a few brief clips of the game in action on both platforms to give you a better idea of just how drastically the higher frame rates improve the look and feel of the action hmm uh come on now faster stop dragging gotta keep going the outcast on the other trail is she crazy come on now faster stop dragging gotta keep going the outcast on the other trail is she crazy good i'm gaining i think i can leap onto the tallneck from here all right now i just have to reach its head i'll have to find another way okay time to climb up to its head and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall horizon zero dawn looks and plays amazing on the pc all the game's incredible visual effects have been perfectly preserved with no noticeable downsides outside of some of the functionality available in the photo mode character models look identical environments are gorgeously detailed still and the game's performance makes fighting robot dinosaurs even more immersive there are a few nice improvements hidden throughout like higher draw distances for objects and shadows along with some improved water simulation but these changes are nothing compared to that glorious jump to an unlocked frame rate but what do you guys think are you impressed with the pc board of the game or were you expecting more let me know in the comments section now if you're
