yo what's up guys so i know i've said this quite a bit in the past but i seriously think we found the best combination of decal and wheels this car when it comes to straight up looks and looking the best it possibly could in terms of cleanness it's got to be up there the only thing i think could make this better is maybe white octane but i personally don't like how white octane feels to play with so i just don't use it but yeah today we're going to be using this brand new super sonic legend decal so if you're a supersonic legend in the season that just finished you get yourself this decal if you're a bronze you got this one champion is this diamond gold grand champ is red for some reason i'm not sure why they did that but it looks pretty good too uh silver looks pretty clean as well silver is like a off-brand uh supersonic legend to be honest just a dimmer color um and then you got platinum honestly they all look pretty nice not gonna lie but super song legend has got to be the best one and then you mix that nice bright white decal with the beautiful old but gold white zombas this car looks crazy like it looks so nice honestly it does i don't think there's a car in terms of just straight up cleanness that can beat this car so today we're gonna be solo queuing some more twos doing some more of our games i think we got ourselves placed finally at grand champ two division three so let's get into some games should be some of the games let's get straight into it hopefully we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we gotta sweaty game [ __ ] off the bat here playing with peak against creams and paulo i recognize every single person in this lobby i put him quite often so i know it's about to be a sweaty one but the decal wheel combo will get us through it there 1v1 here i'm going to fake it there we go i put on the new gold explosion as well i think it just matches the the whole feel of this preset the vibe but yeah that was a good play there at that point in time if i have the ball there i see myself in a 1v1 situation i'm just watching the opponent my eyes are just glued on the opponent i know i have full ball control you shouldn't have to worry about that that's why you want to get your ball control to the point where you don't even have to think about it and it's just easy to understand what to do with the ball right you want to get yourself to that point and once you get there all you have to do there is just focus on the player and that's the the beauty of practicing 1v1 because you can get to that point very easily you get to the point where you're so comfortable with your ball control that you can just look at other things and have dribbling be second nature right so like i said that situation all i was doing was just looking at the opponent the entire time that pretty much gave me all the information i needed to know when i needed to drop the ball off my hood and complete the fake teammate might get beat to this it's gonna be awkward you might have a flip so i have to just wait for this boost should come back in a second good patience should i play this to myself not a boost now so 50 is really good here to be honest gets to my teammate in a pretty good position i know i can't score off that you don't need to try to force to go out of that just be in a position where you can at least give your teammate the ball that's what i was able to do it's fine if it goes back to him i can challenge my teammate again and like i said same situation go straight to my teammate puts him in a prime position to get a free ball now i have to kill time for my teammate and it's a little bit awkward so i'm getting bumped we got a good block i'm gonna go for the mid left boost here try to get ball control if my teammate shoots it's fine just try to keep this in now anything works don't need to try to shoot [ __ ] off of it more just to keep the ball in play play it off the wall like i'm panicking a bit good 50 for my teammate back middle to my teammate i can't get a good shot i'm better to pass that mid it's a better play every single time there i'd say play this left side you don't always have to go for the goal obviously in that situation like although it is free don't overthink it don't panic you have more time than you think you do try to assess the situation around you i know i have time here if he goes for this ball it's fine i know he's not gonna go but if he does go i know i have it covered i played around one here let him touch this maybe play this middle the team is not there so i'll go again try to take the boost from him be annoying i got killed but it's fine good job my teammate baited the ball for me i gotta split it forward might have a shot here really good try tough angle i don't want to dive in on this it's very risky i'd rather just try to get in a position i could help with my teammate but how did i messing up i should have just i should have honestly just full on dope i think my teammate must have stopped or something at midfield it's the only way that would have been a goal i feel like unless maybe i misread a situation but i think he must have just stopped for a second or something because i felt like he should have been back i didn't need to dive on that it's a risky ball to dive in when i was lost back for a while there pop it over one it's gonna be all the way back here that's fine teammates should go here take my time on the bounce i don't know what's that close you might try to make a play here oh really close would have been a really good goal pass it back and give him a lot of options now he's a 1v1 he jumps a little bit early so he's not going to have a play out of this very low chance this goes in got her just played this smart try to make him do something now i can go for this ball try it to the side should be fine i don't have any boost here play round one let my teammate self take good amount of boost here try to pop this up again teammate died this might be really bad now all right we got the kill which is good good block from us maybe he goes for this he can't alright this might be rough i trust i know he's a little booster so i'll take from him nicely forced a good touch for us to be honest they don't have much out of this which is good teammates going for that boost i don't have anything behind him hopefully he knows the challenge good job challenge from us tell my teammate take it i just stopped boosting all together to make sure my teammate knew so you can kind of show your teammate some signs like that sometimes where they'll know us they're about to go for an x-ray it's a good fake jump forced out a big touch for us don't have to overcome any situation just take some pads we're chilling 40 seconds left one goal let him touch his he's awkward last back i'm just gonna fake challenge make him do something make him panic i have the ball again touch it back to my teammate played from us you can't get a goal of this i know that teammates going to right mid boost so i'm just to wait get the ball for free play a good 50 not bad at all teammates should beat him to this he has time he realizes that good dribble smart play i'll take left mid here fake challenge make him do something i can go for him again i know he has no flip there's no danger only thing that makes situation dangerous is if he has a flip there a challenge for my teammate i'm not gonna go for this i want to make him panic take the boost instead this is smarter play play it around nice all right good first game that was quality the car feels really nice to be honest i'm not gonna lie like something about it it's so bright you can't make a car this bright with any other decal right so it just feels super nice yeah pretty good first game to win let's get into the next one stephen keep it up get another dub see how it goes all right we got sobrel against angel and peak sweaty games footy game again these beginning of the season games are always sweaty like this can't get a good shot of this impossible the angle i was coming at a little bit too far so obviously keep pressure it's not bad play it off to my teammate side go for the other corner boost gotta have trust in him to get that play going down field don't want to go for this yet now i have a better opportunity ended up missing so can go for a shot at least drop my team to play patient here smart player already had a couple opportunities to score here tried to go for a shot a little bit weak though it's hard to get a good shot on that angle played around one i'm gonna fake jump make him panic make him hit it away to my teammate [ __ ] to me i'm hoping for the clip i can't really shoot off this i played that mid though if you can't shoot i would always say it's best bet to just get a pass always best bet or just try to play it around your opponent i tried to really line up a good 50 there but they played it well they just sat on the goal line covered the whole net it's round one here good 50 again play off the back wall like i said i couldn't shoot so just make it awkward for the opponent it's best bet it's going to be an awkward 1v1 now for my teammate though should have it pretty easily over one cut off the back wall it's a decent positioning for my teammate almost ended up getting a scored on but play forward to him he's going for the bump i like the idea a lot smart play i try to play in a spot where he can just pop it off the back wall for me but just launching it toward your teammate you know it makes you just give them that option that's the whole point of that situation right i'm just trying to give him an option there he has a couple things you can do you just pop the ball off back wall for me you try to just tap it back for me it's a lot of different options a lot of different things that'll work well play back to him but he played it well going for the bump there smart just thinking about what would be the best thing to get us a goal there and the bump definitely is up there i'm gonna fake this fake the big hit he has to go back to goal and respect me i can go for a shot i could bump on one he's using the super sonic legend decal as well everyone's using that now feels like i think everyone's catching on one of the better decals released could be from us teammates should have this he knows it says ball here jump a little bit early but it's fine he actually played really well i'll go back wall all i can do here is boom it high try to play down i thought my team is ground to be honest so i played that badly for the situation trying to help all right we had everything blocked if i spawn right side i think it's better here it's fine though i don't think there was a back boost up but it'll work out teammate played it well downfield trying to make him panic he messed up he uses flip after somebody uses their flip in a situation like that you know most of the danger is gone so it's a really good thing to look out for try to make people flip early decent play for my teammate because stay honest it's huge got away here that again is sweaty the demos teammates should have trust him let him go for that that's fine block dangle on goal get 50 from us nice dude the new explosion holy it's so bright really good 50 from us so smart well played didn't have many options we're playing out these two games pretty smart very very minimal mistakes i don't have many options that's how you got to play out twos let me go back wall here get a much more favorable 50 going backwards and if you just sit on the floor nice all right they ended up leaving that's gonna be off this one though i hope you guys enjoyed the video even though it was a little bit shorter than i would like it to be
