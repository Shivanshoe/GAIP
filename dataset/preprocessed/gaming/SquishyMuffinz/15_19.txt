against mr s daddy andy and combat angel already these games have actually been fun for me lately you should not like rank threes that much but generally i've been actually enjoying it it's a good demo i don't know how i didn't kill him as well i thought i was definitely going fast enough looked odd if you touch for me should get a big hit like awkward for him try to bump him as well hit the other run through take their boost soft touch to myself here should be able to play it over him as well i'm gonna make it harder the last time back it's very interesting fake i feel like i definitely scored i just misread that he's gonna do that didn't really make much sense to fake there so kind of a hard thing to read one of the beauties of not quite being an ssl yet random stuff like that happens way more often than you'd expect let's get it look a try can't really commit on this still has full control of the situation as such as try to get ready to go back post there to react whatever's going to come could be bad let's say gonna fake first here retouch now really good fake i'm past middle instead of shooting and that's just unfortunate can you do so i ended up going straight into like my path falling down this happens he didn't try to do that i didn't try to do that this goes on sometimes i sit forward probably the left side here if he wants to use me my turn i don't think he is so i'll just go i'll play it over one more it might get beat to that okay wow it could have been bad i have zero boost here i should should have just expected him to miss because all they've been doing is missing in the situations but oh good it's been a hard game to read what's going on i feel like a lot of stuff just very unexpected but definitely a very winnable game not doing anything we can't beat here might be bad though kind of open for a bit try the passage here get attempts actually good try i'm just got the dunk perfect there nice it's a good read of them not being able to go i think that's how i kind of just said whatever i'm just gonna expect them not to go because that's like the thing they shouldn't have uh done there they've been doing a lot of what they shouldn't be doing so i'm just gonna play what i don't expect to happen sounds weird but honestly what i did there i did what i thought they shouldn't do i played off what i shouldn't do there it worked should be okay it around two with that one touch shouldn't touch it to the side control here played around one it's not just gonna be not great try to bump last let's go for bumps yeah at least force them like to at least have to back off like give that to me a little bit more space to make a put on the wall there which i think is good i think it's worth it let's play it around them here best case scenario would be my teammate being able to bump him but i think it was just too hard right behind pop one forward unfortunately i'm trying to play for that boost kind of trying to play it around them let him hit should be okay got the boost actually really big there and i dunked both which is good do you make sure you go nice just faking no one like over commit a spot like that especially because i'm technically third man for a while there so it's really not worth it to just full commit on something like that there's the chance of us even scoring is so low maybe a shot here actually really a pass even though it wasn't like just straight on target it was a really good pass to be able to score jump just in case i don't want to leave that uncontested honestly don't say i can't say with confidence i have trust in my ring teammates say that every time my pro game probably leave it but again the kickoff just got missed in the ball stationary so i don't really have um you know you can't really call me crazy for not having a full trust there in this situation oh well i'm not expecting to be there maybe a goal oh unfortunate would have had the free shot challenge for him nice i'm gonna fake you you should panic make a take now a shot push played off the corner and just leave teammates shouldn't get it in fact we should be up now in a second unless someone went all the way back for this okay i was going to say should have been up even before that oh i can't really commit on this should be fine to the right would be huge wow okay getting a little bit sketchy didn't want to there again because he might be playing the fake so i kind of faked first that's it if you're a third man like the main thing i feel like you have to think about is just is this worth flipping into if it's not worth flipping into then don't do it because most time it's just not your teammates can't help you i was about to just stay there for the miss because he's been missing a lot take my time here teammates need boost and they need to like find a way to get moving forward so oh actually almost just worked as a goal dropped it for myself played the bump would have worked waited so long on that team i should have for free like the dribble here actually really smart try to play it around today i wasn't going for a shot there because i feel like the shot was blocked every time let's read i went back just in case the best way to deal with that situation i touch mic killer pressure for a bit i'm gonna go back my teammates don't have any way to follow this up so would be fine retouch maybe one more he would be huge play to the left wait for his touch here i'm gonna fake play a low pump him off as well he'll turn across here most of the time this will spill at mid off this 50 if they can actually challenge it looks like they're keeping it in a good spot but not that happen let's head up to the corner boost they should be there for it nice actually good shot let's nice should be fine it's not gonna do anything really just plain to beat me there and if i challenge when i should like i did i should be back more than in time nice well done very um very sweaty game mainly just rotations to be honest but it's fun all right get the next one see me keep it up get back to my dubs see how it goes all right we had glocka paperclip against ventus density in miles for the last game maybe end off strong here i don't know i love that name so much paperclip sick hit round one no miss teammate probably can't score though i wasn't expecting all the the whips to come through should let him go go to the wall here let's follow it up the double touch mid actually would have been really good i think i'm gonna wait didn't have one more touch here touch my teammate just gonna wait behind again go back hole that's fine i actually should have probably not even jumped off that wall at all wait that's crazy these four oh my gosh that's actually crazy he got bumped and back flipped off of it and scored off of it that's crazy definitely a tilter for the other team and that guy could have said that he panics really hard always try to use the space you have you have all the way until the ball's on the goal line right to try to use as much space of that as possible i think you try to save a little bit too early and more time than he thought he did of course good attempt he's gonna backflip oh almost dunked him as well actually a good pass i blocked everything out so it's kind of forced to go for the passing route there it's all done pass is the smartest thing there i think nice pop retouch here try to hit it over him i meant he may have a double maybe fine there's playing the beat i don't mind that it's challenging that's not a big deal you could say from him i played a round one you're trying to bump me i think it's better to go for the booster just keep pressure and it should be here if we touch nicely middle here my time to actually place the shot instead of just panicking too because i know i have time there i had an idea where everybody was i knew the mid guy i couldn't actually stop the pass it's a lot more time than it looked like gonna grab the mid boost here played as missed for a second just in case i still pull boost you can turn again here go for a bump i'm gonna stay ready middle in case anything can happen for me ah i could have maybe scored it to be on i don't think it would have been ready if it was on target maybe he would have been nice teammates should have time though okay left maybe close if he flipped left at the end there would have been a crazy pass i got right mid here just chill trying to beat him i can actually shoot off that but these beats and the bump is more than enough there it's gonna be a really good play to get that goal hit around one put it around two and then just ignore the ball one for the bump on the last guy the sorry play to make there for sure i'm not sure what he's trying to say that's winter not sure what he means by that honestly i was kind of just rolling with that you should never jump i just jumped for that ball just kind of trolling turned off my brain for a second i'm trying to figure out what that guy meant to say just playing the miss there's a vehicle if you miss it why not put a round one off the wall he actually messed up yeah turned really bad there always trying to put yourself in a position where you're facing the ball like you turn himself away from the ball in a really bad spot there but it's all good all right get two games today we're almost at ssl we're actually extremely close but i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
