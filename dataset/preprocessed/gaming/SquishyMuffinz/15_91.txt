yo what's up guys gonna be queueing all ones twos and threes whatever we get we'll play let's get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got two's game off the bat and we got we got justin no way against jasper and t curls it's a good lobby let's try it from just on the shot if i didn't get bumped there i should have wait on this so i can't really pounds yet make him hit it away doesn't get a free ball wait for the fake key trying to 1v2 from justin maybe both of them jump off that so it's actually not bad make him jump early justin should go for me now i was actually a bad such a bad shot from him but that's one of those situations where the shot's so bad that it actually works like most pros in that scenario is gonna expect the perfect like top corner shot so the secret to scoring on pros in that situation is literally just to shoot bad no one ever expects the bad shot wait for both of them they're both up i know i tried the past i hit off the wall here just absolutely destroyed me on the the challenge adjusting the ball in the corner hope you make a play here i think justin's actually just starting to play ranked first time this season somebody doesn't play much rank nobody grinds a lot of unranked actually he enjoys enjoys casual it's actually really relaxing playing catches though like i've started to play every now and then and it's actually really fun i like it a lot and for the bounce here then i have the password i think i gotta stop passing it's my my threes have it especially when i see justin i like to cut it past them but it's not a good idea you choose this way on the ground here nice from justin he's gonna have a wonder what now for a little bit try to be annoying i can't really go for that about that should i kill him like fire right here if he wants to use me i'm gonna have a pinch probably got a pass to him on the ceiling oh [ __ ] did it mean to get in his way there gonna have one more touch i gotta be careful i have some time to make a play here try again i keep trying to pass and it's just not good and twos a lot of time it just gets you scored on but i like i like to practice playing this way because i like the playing threes right i think the best way to play is using each other i've always kind of thought that so i definitely i definitely like the practice the same way i like to play in threes shot from dustin though thunder's instantly go for that messed up his touch a little bit take my time for justin to get back now go for a solo play here nice good job from justin to be there decided to not pass this one time and it worked the beauty of being selfish and soul playing in twos more often than not works when you pass actually leaving a bad spot most of the time let's say from t-crow from the side here i step dressing gonna wait for his touch here he probably has one a double i'm gonna hit her around them let me have to go for shots there it's more just to keep the ball in right just keep them in an awkward situation apart from justin attempting to solo play he's got a white patient hit this high here see if he does nice with the i was close it's a good attempt just gonna leave that now there should be fine i can go there back i'll be okay we'll have two people back as long as these challenges are good all right good first game let's get the next one let's even keep it up get back to bag dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a ones game for the last match gonna fake challenge show off the bat try to get an idea how he wants to play i'm actually not sure who this is but it's probably good i found this game instantly and i'm pretty high in ones he's gonna try to address me early probably most of the time i'm gonna fake jump here like i think i'm up for this and i can challenge i get all this boosts take my time here there we go i like not to flip up that because flipping it that makes you just fully commit right if you flip with that and you miss you're gonna be in the net and you're gonna be stuck there's no way to actually convert it and you're probably giving them a free goal to be honest so saying ground that even if you miss it covers all the options again just gonna say ground but if i die it's okay actually kind of a bad situation though still i don't really like that spot that i was in but might still work out fine it's going for a lot of demos from behind this is a smart way to play for sure i just closed down this angle it doesn't have many ways to shoot that so i know i have freedom to try to close that down there should be okay awkward situation because i got stuck on the post i think the fake jump there of the wig dash might have made him jump i'm not sure but if so that's pretty good just make them jump for this right if we take it on on net anywhere you have to try to block the shot i don't mind that situation for us most of the time i take this mid boost not try to aggress him again make him not feel too comfortable in in his area his owner try to get this boost now it's our ball unless he pinches this of course i'm staying just close enough to the ballroom we can actually stop all these plays which is good we're not giving him space i think a big problem that that i used to have really bad in ones i give people a little bit too much space where i think if you stay on people and you just make them a little bit more panicked that makes her life a lot harder because even a situation like that i should have probably closed that down earlier instead of giving him a chance at that shot at all hopefully he just misses this probably has though yeah that was one of those spots where if i just wait i save it for sure but i tried to be unpredictable challenge early but if i wait all he has there is a very slow air dribble and it should be okay for me to save it really good save actually he read like the the randomness of that really well see he does off this i want him to go he's not going though get that high i'm going to fake jump for this as well so i can get that touch back to me kind of makes him think he has to beat me right but i'm so grounded all he does is hear that that sound cue and has the ball above his head it's really hard for him to know what's coming and it's the challenge here if you could challenge off that first touch it's always best off the touch where they're actually trying to control the ball that's the best one to challenge off of alright we have time here let me go up the wall i don't have a flip here but i can fake that i do i have a free net so i think that i have that wave dash fake that i have the the threat of the flip and the whole time he's gonna be worried about it to get kickoff shutters 50 on me didn't win the mid boost i can go back i should have stayed i think but it might be okay for me still really good reactionary save that was a mistake i knew as soon as i was pushing forward that was a mistake it was actually obvious he's gonna do that but i should have left some space between me and him just to wait for that touch and even if it got over me i had some boost to deal with situation pick the kick off here get the possession for free should i make a play off this nice i wanted to fake their dribble see if he'd actually you know bite on it if he if he actually went for the first challenge i would have been able to tap it over him i think that was my intention at least nice really good pick there again there's that chance to just shoot it on net right he has to pre-jump that and then i could just back off get a good 50. i still have boost as well and it keeps my position so it's almost better in every way to fake that than to go all in for the shot him pre-jumping literally just allows me to be able to fake that i'm gonna stay again here see that's the right play i think that's something i should have done earlier right there's kind of goes with what i was talking about trying to shut down the space as early as possible right not to give him time to actually make a play but i went too wide on the the boost path there and he was able to just get a really good flick if the flick was bad i would have saved it but you got the perfect flick not saving that one nice wait for this bouncy i think i'll go right away didn't expect me to shoot there we go i plan to go for my boost but i still had full speed right the only thing that boost does on the gun is help you get to full speed and i'm ready full speed so i don't really need it pop it once i just gotta wait for follow-up shot actually it was so much better for him that he missed like that was actually a thousand times better for him that he missed that because obviously if that was bottom corner i have it saved and i thought it was i thought there's no way he can miss this right sometimes making those like little mistakes actually work out better for you in this game i've noticed oh i think he own gold i like that attempted shot from me there because again i can say ground any shot that you can actually stay grounded and recover off of i think is always gonna be better than something where you can i've always thought that way especially in ones it's just something that like you'd never want to put yourself in a spot where you're fully committing on a flip for a challenge or something like that or fully committing on a shot because it's going to leave you in a really bad spot after the fact and you're most likely going to get scored on so you always want to put yourself in the most advantageous position when it comes to your offense especially in 1v1 because one mistake and you're automatically getting countered on but uh yeah big dub there yeah i think like eight points eight or ten points off that pretty good all right good game today guys hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as well as watching this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace you
