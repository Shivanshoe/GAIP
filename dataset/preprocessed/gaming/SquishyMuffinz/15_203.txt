but yeah let's get into the games for today i'll stop rambling i appreciate y'all as always you guys know i do so let's get into the games let's see how it goes all right for the first game of the video we're playing against dot dot hazard and titan i believe it's how you say that i'll try to get this over to the right side it's not bad for alpha cap could have been lower for sure would have been better for him if it was lower not bad though wait for his touch here on the back wall driver should have that over to alpha i'm just gonna wait try to follow this up in a second let's try you could pass over to gyro let's be patient here good defense should be a goal there we go i tried to kill him for some reason it didn't demo him i'm not sure why to be honest did i slow down maybe just the corner of my car hit weird but yeah got the goal still it was a good uh i could clear that from gyro that was what allowed that play to even be possible cut away middle here if he wants to use me nice pass from gyro really good job from him to look for me there obviously we have to give him that option but that's hugely on gyro to give the proper pass there so all the credit goes to gyro there on that on that pass good stalling from us i'm going to win on this boost just for an extra second good job from jar we're going to wait back here i played a smart for my team i could just bait them in here let him touch that it's fine again i don't need to overclean for any of these balls i'll just let them hit this away there's no issue with this to be honest because it goes straight to my teammate i'm gonna play patient here should be alpha kept's ball that's actually really a pass really fast room didn't expect them to go for the pass i could have played that a little bit different i should have jumped at all i think i should have drove up my back so i would have stayed pretty easily so playing patient there and not committing especially when i wasn't sure if i was last man if i knew i was last man i obviously wouldn't win at all but if you're not sure because you're not calming for whatever reason then you should definitely play it a little safer than i did there good play from gyro here good play hold on good pass jar was just a facilitator good touch to control that to himself hit it over another guy and pass the middle it's a really tough thing to do we made that look super easy jar was very talented for sure try to take a light touch here just go down to the ground play it around then i'll just leave it there that's fine should be alpha's ball to go for next right behind you worst case scenario dryer gets me to that ball it goes straight to me anyway there's really no downside to it should have maybe went for a pass there the alpha kept or not jumped at all would have been the better plan and taking it more slow fade off the wall let him hit that mid pass to me maybe pass back to kep good try i'm just gonna place to the wall and go back let them hit it over to us oops my jump got eaten that happens right when you come off the wall if you jump the game literally just doesn't let you jump for whatever reason so definitely something you have to kind of get used to i couldn't get a good touch on that i couldn't even tell where it was off the wall it was in such an awkward spot but yeah something you have to get uh kind of used to as time goes on still messes me up very often it's a very annoying thing that a lot of people might not be aware of passing this off to kep you could beat forward here i should try to fake this make him hit it away take time back here try to play it around good demo should be easy for my team though nice i'm trying to block there from gyro let him pass this right maybe play this off the wall should be shootable oh almost got the dunk as well good try from caps gonna be a 1v1 for a while gyro is normally pretty smart with dealing with these though still a lot of time for the team to get back it's kind of all he needed to do and he got the the block which was huge that was very smart from jar very well dealt with and he got a goal he literally just won't be three dumb stuff well done from him i'm making some mistakes on defense this game but still coming through with the win all that matters so far at least we have the win gotta hold on to it good shot from dryer i'll try to go for this play at mid it's fine maybe a little bit too risky for me there fully committed for that that was a good pass from gyro well done jar is playing really well looking for his teammates whenever he has a chance to that's all you can ask out of a teammate in threes being very aware of where everybody is trying to go up the wall with this started blocking me i don't know if i like going for those nowadays because i feel like everybody's really good at defending it and there's more risk involved than reward it seems i had to just bump him there dryer pre-jumped my pass it looked like i went for the bump on the other guy so it didn't exactly work out as we intended but this should be okay it's not going to be any danger with this good control from kev you're trying to shot there from gyro might have faked him a little bit so i'm last back for a bit here that's where you got to kind of throw in a fake challenge and then try to delay for your team if you can to me driving toward that and stopping is me just trying to fake challenge and bait out any kind of play from the opponent there trying to make it less dangerous all my teammates will be back in a second trying to stay on this i'll get the boost first thing that's more important here i'll just play that off the ceiling i'll just keep this in hit it up the wall should be fine the pinch oh should still work there we go i wanted that to be top bins pinch there i was hoping but definitely works all right good first game solid stuff from us again to the next one let's see how close we are to supersonic legend off of that how many points we we gained as well i think thank you uh let's see we're at 18.89 i think we gained one point from that if i'm not mistaken so this uh super sonic legend thing might be a little bit out of reach for a bit here because gyro is super sonic legend and probably pretty high up on leaderboard because gyro is a grinder so the higher he is up on the leaderboard the less points that we will get uh from from winning these so let's see where is gyro probably pretty high up i'm guessing it's not that high actually all right jar is 57 so yeah we're not gonna gain crazy amount of points from every win right now but it'll still be something so let's keep on grinding let's even get some more dubs let's see how it goes a pretty sweaty game here we got bembo mile and snake so let's see how this goes like the soft sheet on these see if all my boost that whatever happens i can follow up on i'm going to hit that doesn't really accomplish much for them i play this off the gyro good beat my pass could have been better i need to lead on gyro there more what i mean by that is just try to hit it in front of your teammate wherever you possibly whenever you have the time to and you're passing like that always look for trying to hit it in front of where your teammate is so they could kind of like transfer more power into the shot if you hit it directly at them it's going to be a lot harder for them to to get a good play on it let me wait for the bounce here let him hit that try to pass middle nice last middle again the cap good teamwork a try i'll be waiting mid here if he wants to use me should be kept ball to pass to the right here can't really touch it so i'll leave it for him gyro to go next hit this off the wall to myself let's go for a shot there we go good place moving the ball around the field really [Music] well yeah gyro sees it too we are moving the ball around super well i'll put it over to gyro side put it again over to where there will be space and a teammate and i'll just wait middle here if he wants to use me [Music] leave that for my teammate play it over to the left for him you should play this back down to me play this again to kept side don't need to go for a shot at all here looking for each other every single time we have the chance to see i'm just going to bait this play this over the gyro our ball movement is actually crazy right now play this over the gyro side again trying to keep the ball for as long as we possibly can they haven't even be able to touch the ball really low-key walking circles around them right now looks like he's missing so i'll just go there we go that was our chance to strike and when you do see that opportunity you can't be afraid to go for it because most of the time your instinct is correct and you should follow your instinct always that's a big thing about rocket league you can't be second guessing your instincts if you think that you're about to make the right play then do exactly what you think should be right in that situation you can't take time to second guess your decisions in this game it's just not gonna work so here i'm just gonna try to bait the ball up for my team now it's my time to go for it because you lost possession of that it's a good 50 for us it's good especially because we kind of lost it behind us which means that my teammates end up getting the ball out of it play it back to gyro side if i had a little bit more boost probably a goal oh that's my fault too it's not on gyro it was a good good idea it's a selfless idea didn't go for the shot straight off the bat should i control this back it's like time here bait the jump in i've kept a free dribble same situation here i'm gonna make them just hit this ball away i don't care if it goes down to my teammate that's actually a really good thing if it's around me there we go that was beautiful good plays so many good players in this video already it feels like playing super well as a team that's a super good three-man play very fast don't do that against me ah almost the play almost one more finger oh close good idea all the way back here demonstration here i'm gonna fake this trying to get my team the ball kinda did it's a right idea there have a lot of time here i'm going to play this over to the left side take the time when we have it should be gyra's ball can't reach it so i'm just going to go down save my boost here i'm not going to go for that no point of aerialing with my 20 boost or just wasting it all so i might as well just go back should be a goal maybe i'll never mind is it safe from now yeah we played gyro on uh on sunday in the major first round uh which will be i think after this video comes out so that's the context of why he said don't do that against me refer to touch again here let him touch that that's fine i could just go back now he's gonna be the only one for a while this could be dangerous but jared is very smart on defense so should be okay good 50s almost a goal out of that i'm going to try to take our back corner boost here should be a double tap from dry right here most likely good try very good attempt and leave that boost for gyro good pass i shouldn't have won it all would have been the smarter play just to bait that out and go back but steak was made you learn from it move on wait for a mile here i'm going to be alone for a bit this is when it gets really tough because you have to play it smart you got it but there yeah which i was saying you can't see through the wall sometimes on the back wall it's very true it's kind of an annoying glitch that's been happening lately that's actually really good points for us because uh mile is super sonic legend so that's pretty good all right i hope you guys enjoyed that some really really good gameplay out of us out of us three as a team yeah i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this like comment subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace [Music] you
