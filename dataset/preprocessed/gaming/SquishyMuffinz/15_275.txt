call it as many cool goals as possible we're not gonna play down to the rank plane we're just gonna have fun with it and show you have any cool as possible you guys have been requesting that for a very long time so many you guys haven't asked me to do something like this and we brought along a fan favorite player one of my best friends forever says 2015 so it's a blast to have him here along my side and record this with me so yeah I hope you guys check out his channel I'll announce who it is right now it is energy Justin the homie for the longest time the link will be down below to his channel so make sure you do check him out he just started his computer not so long ago make sure you drop him a sub he makes amazing content one of the best players in the world probably has been the best player in the world for the last two years in my opinion definitely check out his content use a homie to me it always has been yeah there's gonna be a really fun series like I said it's gonna be having fun with it trying to get as many cool goals as possible today we're gonna be starting off with some of our placement games will show every single game and just you can see these are brand-new fresh accounts zero games have been played I'm gonna try to get you know I really I won percentage hopefully hundred percent we're gonna be messing around a little bit but we're obviously gonna try to win also just really quick before we get into the games just a back story on our names and profile pictures I asked Justin to pick a show and they picked Outer Banks which is a Netflix series I don't actually watch it but I decided why not we'll pick a different show I mean every now and then I'm guessing change up the names people don't know it's us but he's gonna be Sarah Cameron for this episode now I'm gonna be Deputy shoot I think is that you saying I'm actually never washed out or not was pronounced but we have our profile pictures and names change to the characters in the show so that's why our names are that just just a little backstory but we'll get into the games now should be some good ones let's get into it let's have some fun all right so our first opponent is actually someone who's split screening it seems you don't even know how to go for the kickball fast enough so this is definitely gonna be a interesting start so the six is already off the ceiling I think we grab the boost did something about like the early games of these I always have funny to me it's gonna be like super weird at first cuz these guys these guys won't be able to actually like go for the ball so just gonna be them kind of just watching us so we're hoping for some reactions I guess and get as many cool goals as possible for you guys but yeah sorry about the little stutters I don't know why that's happening it's been happening lately but hope my mic sounds better by the way guys I did make some changes to it Chuck pass it to Justin try to get as many passes over to him as possible so I'm pretty jumping on the side the other part is watching like what the hell is acting I was gonna say I made some adjustments to my mic and I should sound better now you shouldn't hear as much at the background noise so I know you guys been asking about that for a while try to remove that so I'm glad I finally got it removed to an extent I hope I hope it sounds okay let me know down below oh my said his wine hey know what to do here I said free jump oh I tried the fasted bag dude this is gonna be like the trollese other guys have I've ever done but I know you guys are gonna want us to do comms so I'm fully done to do comms and one of the the future videos for sure and a bunch of them if you guys really want it no problem at all Oh back nice around that boost I wish these guys do have that tight man I didn't know how to type and make it somewhere better his first team you guys have been ask me I do something this for a long time I figured it'd be more fun to do with someone I know is very good you can go for cool clips together rather than me just trying to do a bunch of solo stuff I thought I could jump off the ceiling pre jump um try to get some nutty ankles deputy shoe is on the case I was naughty fast from who Justin nice double but it [ __ ] haha this schemes already been investing a surprise these guys aren't armed forfeiting probably just mesmerized no wait the ceiling we might still work I said here for the double that buys back Justin what is that she she she it's really crazy though like this skill ceiling and rocket League you really notice it when you see like pro players at high school players playing against lower rank that's what I really want to do that series where I found a 1 B 5 or 1 B 6 different ranks just so you guys can really see like the skill difference and Rockley it is crazy I was a big mistake for me not the best bass tried too hard to get a get past I actually messed it up oh we're gonna get used to going for these days you're looking clips we never go for them in obviously pro games or your high tension games his there gets going on most of the time but in this obviously there's no real downside to it Mike yeah sheesh everybody got in so many in singles it's gonna be a super fun series I definitely think if we're it calms we'll bill to get cooler stuff does it cold or up and stuff so I guess I definitely let me know if you guys want called I know you will and we'll do uh videos in the future with comms Oh I didn't have to do [Music] I'll pass it back oh you actually just drove into Justin you guys actually haven't really been terrible for bronze I feel like in bronze II fine like really inconsistent matchups where people won't even know how to how to crush the ball and these guys they're a weird like mixture of brand new and also kind of decent for their rank I don't know it's weird oh yeah Risa Kennedy stuff like this on ps4 when you first met each other back at 2015 but obviously we both suck so wasn't as fun as it will be now let me try to bring this up this wall bang off the crossbar oh do you really get so much better this I get so like we'll get the setups down I'll try to pass it back so I think you got bombs holy right over to him bang I got to make a see you guys can see his alpha Bruce as well cuz he's using it as ball and Bacchus one two forgotten somebody in the goal this just one game is all you let me make a montage out of this single game folks I messed up wasn't that fast alright they finally forfeited finally after all those goals that was a super good first game that's just the idea of what I want this series to be like it's just a lot of fun a lot of good goals and just two pros having a lot of fun he said next go backward I'm down this is gonna be a backboard champion game when you try to snipe me over and over again y'all too good alright let's get into the next one see if we can get some banger goals I'll stay on the backboard the last game of this video alright first second placement game the last game of this video putting its cake and mighty schemes and Justin wants me to stand backwards so I'm gonna go for kickoff I think I don't know I think so yeah I'm gonna have to go off and then I'm gonna go on backboard right away see just thinking there are some passes over to me I trust these guys are already better though though I'm actually curious how many games gonna take for us to get the GC like this oh dude I feel like Jessa's Justin's gonna be better at these in me I've always felt like inconsistent I've been so on the spot also like it's super fun to just do a bunch of passing plays like back and forth passes so he could probably get some goals like that as well it doesn't need to all be you know like super high up free jumps just bumping me I'm at flipster oh my god oh my god you imagine but the best little wall you go back to where I sick let's see Jessa's gonna hit them every time guarantee Ganci you're gonna hit the first one I hit to him I don't really practice those but like in a game I feel like in an actual game I'm not bad at them and I can hit okay this guy is way too good oh this guy's way too good for for bronze this cake guy we're probably gonna run those Smurfs as well though it's inevitable [Music] for this guy's crazy I heard yes it is dude this guy is insane this guy is actually insane I'm going wall the bounce-back yeah this guy's not fun there's no way that's guys broad 30 that's the one oh my I was super close all right we gotta set up again that's funny already buddy running into the Smurfs it's crazy how many's firsts are in this year I'm not complaining obviously we're on it's perfect ounce but it's just like crazy it's way more now than it used to be oh my god that would be actually insane if you hit that tag to me whatever rake we're playing at but this guy keeps pressuring me every time I try to pass it's too good give me crack on the Oh if they hit the Justinian somehow I don't know how but if it did it was the nuts guys are nuts gonna go up that's fine that's the one thing you know I was a absolute slapper in Dustin get past his shot off right I'm off he's been a pastor man I love Houston I don't know what it is so I wonder what passing just fun to me obviously likes corn as well but hit the perfect pass so satisfying Oh Oh what are we nuts no comment no compris tiling why are we in singing dude what the hell there's so many good goals this video it's actually been a lot of fun it's nice just thoughtfully oh my god is so bad sorry cuz it's been bad fast I should have just banged it right away I'm in incomp mode still a little bit part of me could have been a better pass for sure which I had this adjustments I like a call I was gonna get this to me that's so stupid this guy's just a phase the backward pass the pinch down to the pre jump we got some good gold zone that one wasn't that great but definitely gotten some googles this video I think most Road aggressions take like I want to say like 30 30 years games 28 25 to 30 games if you went all of them so it's like I have at least at least 12 videos of this straight good goals minimum to Justin Oh Mike I wish I kept flying should I pass to him we had it we had to go for like a bunch of passing places to you when we're in columns oh he's fun no time to you I did another big but it's fun though Ally it's fun just floating around carelessly oh sorry are you guys GC how do we respond to that no I can keep it up it is no wait cake is brand new I don't believe that he was way too good to be brand Navis unranked as well and you never liked fly already kind of anyway that's gonna be what you can expect out of this series I hope you guys enjoyed it's gonna be a lot more of that obviously it's a higher ranks gonna be harder to do this cool stuff but it's gonna be a lot of fun make sure you do subscribe to Justin because he is an insane player or very good contact creator as well he notes which pretty often if you guys want to fall over there and yeah he's gonna be uploading every single game from this series on his channel from his POV so you guys should watch that as well he's insane so yeah have yourself a wonderful day or night like I said I'll see it on the next love yo peace
