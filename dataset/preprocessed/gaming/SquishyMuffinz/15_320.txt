subscribers from this point until 1 million so make sure your the SUBSCRIBE one enjoy the video guys yo what is up guys this is the series that I absolutely could not wait to get started this is our road to grand champ in Seoul standards but we can't score a goal throughout the entire series we have to get from unranked to grand champ without scoring goals so we have to make place for our team in terms of assisting or just bumping players out of the way you're just creating chances for them to get goals so the whole point of the series is cambiar each branch here without scoring a single goal it's gonna help you guys a lot in terms of learning how to play with your team how to rotate and how to just create opportunities for them so this is something that every single person's we're trying to get better at the game competitively if you want to become a pro player at some point in time you need to know how to play threes correctly I'm gonna be trying to give you guys as many tips as possible from all my experience in pro play in 3b3 I'm gonna try to put that into this series and give you guys as many tips as possible in terms of setting up your team and creating as many opportunities as possible but yeah it's gonna be a fun time for sure we've made it to grand champ in TV 2 and when we won and we only lost one game so far as we see we're fifty nine matches played everybody grande chip and both of those players the one game that we did lose was in the random camera setting series and we figured out that was just gonna be impossible to play against the the high-ranked I don't think this challenge would be impossible against high ranked and I think this will be one that can generally help a lot of people that are trying to get better at 3s learning how to rotate and just trying to figure out new ways to pass the ball cuz there's a lot more to the game than just banging it off the corner even though in the low ranks you'll probably see me trying to be that a lot more because that's all that the lower rights can read in terms of passing but when you enter the higher ranks the game is a lot more than just hitting it off the corner right you can still do that and it'll still work but that's I'm going to show you guys throughout the series there's a lot of things you could do to pass the ball and create opportunities for your team so right now as you guys can see we're at 274 goals in our 59 games right so that number should not change at all throughout the series when we're done the series when we reach agree in Seoul centered we should still be at 274 goals with way more matches played obviously but we should still be at that same number of goals and hopefully we don't lose that many times but we'll obviously have to lose a couple games here and there I'm assuming just because it's gonna be gonna be hard for our team to score every single thing that we give them but I'm gonna try to see how good we can do if we can even pull this off I'm not sure but we're gonna try and this is a serious guys no matter how long it takes no matter how much we lose I'm gonna be giving it my all until we reach grand champ I promise we're gonna release as many episodes as we need to until we finish this thing I promise you guys this will be my most jam-packed with tips series that you'll see on this channel ever probably and I'm gonna try to do more like this in the future and other game modes maybe even at to be two like this that'd be really tough but I could try something that if you guys like this idea but I think there's a lot to learn out of this seriously guys so yeah without further ado let's get into the games but this is the number that we don't want changing at all until we get to grand champs so that's we're gonna try to do if we accidentally score I think the only way to counteract that is to try to own goal but it's gonna make my teammates a little bit upset so let's just try not to accidentally score and if we do we'll deal with it when it comes so yeah hopefully we don't ever though but yeah let's get into the games we are zero to ten matches played in solo standard as you can see so his first few games will be interesting like I said I can't score so my teammates are very bad at everything with they can't jump so high I'm gonna try to keep the ball grounded I'm gonna try to keep the ball low for them to be able to score so that's the whole point of this let's see how the rink progressing Sola stated I'm actually very excited so let's get into it all right so we found our first game again I'm not sure what we're gonna get we have to console players against three PC players and one of them seems to be a brand new account based off of the question mark profile picture there we're gonna grab this back boost alright not bad we're gonna pop this up here see if my teammates do give him a chance to shoot on that try to put a little bit defensive as well I don't want like goals in as well.you we can't score but we also want to be getting scored on of course I was trying to make it by a couple people here we got a kill and I'm just gonna roll this around the curve just to see what they can do so try the aerial for the ball a lot of them are which is good to see I'm gonna play back here my team I said both forward I can see them on my on my screen I see both of them so I know that I should be going for a super aggressive challenge trying to get me score don t miss dinner they're both art rotating very well like quantum should already be were sitting behind me in that situation but that's a thought point of the series you just gotta see what we're dealing with the soleus a turd trying to learn how to play around your teammates should be easy ball from a teammate nice again what's like get a full boost I'm trying not to waste it on absolutely nothing about my teammates shoot well done let's go big plays from this serie that's right I don't know how to say his name to be honest but good play yeah I like to see that quality quality quality also we change the dance of prison Mike I've used the prison Mike picture from the office I forgot a coal kick off I wasn't paying attention that's my bed so we can get in front of the equity members waiting so I'm gonna try to help you mount good pass I'll put it to the side I'll fake you I know I have a little space that I have right so I'm gonna pop this middle and see my teammates do okay I need to put this to the side be safe now I'm just gonna pull this up middle even though no one's there you want to kind of practice being able to do that obviously Judy does off the corner I wish you just I'm gonna fake because on point of series I can't shoot that stuff so it's good to fake this for the sake of the series oh my god don't go in ok we're good must remember kicked in my teammate is bumping me not sure his position it hasn't been too great my teammate which I pass back to him nice pass back on my team a half close oh you're so funny trying to create some plays here I'm gonna see this off the backboard I don't need to shoot because again I'm not allowed to but can I open up this chance at least to shoot you didn't go for the shot but it's all good oh ok ok ok so I get it's all ghetto his name isn't quantum what am i seeing you I don't know why I've been calling him quantum it's named out Adam oh alright well talking it's ok no problem no problem at all he hasn't hit the ball a single time that's not too good I meant to me okay I know this is this is why this is hard because my teammate actually I think you just got the game for the first time but luckily my other teammates not terrible my familiar for the ball you're nice I'll pass it over to them again I don't want the pass back take the shot oh my head is off the backboard I guess okay try to discover this is like no whitey me okay it's fine it's fun take outside okay these early ranks up a lot of you guys you're not gonna learn a crazy man just be funny trying to get them to score oh you got that open net come on buddy Oh closest I'll show you get back middle okay no no one's gonna be there on my team so I got to be patient here I gave him time nice he hit the ball this time let's go huge I'm gonna go for this I'm just going off the corner nobody can't go straight in and my teammates can maybe finish this off should be open close good try we're getting there were getting there I mean I off the corner again I really hope one of these just doesn't go straight in off of that off the wall this time open up another opportunity come on team they're they're just not positioning in spots where they can help me out they probably wasting their boost a lot when they shouldn't be yeah I still your time here if we have a lot of space on the ball but since the guy bumping us get past my teammate I was gonna play it middle but he's gone for the solo play again I'm using like a high rate mentality right now and I keep forgetting what we're working with here trying to play this middle okay not gonna lie that Adam guy has hit me more than he's even been close to hitting the ball but it's okay maybe he's not sure how the game works yet you never know we're actually gonna lose hold no this is so hard like if I could score it's obviously wouldn't be hard at all but it makes it hard cuz one of my teammates just isn't sure what's going on I mean alright teammates should go nice perfect rotations we got going on here exactly what you want to be doing I've placed over to my teammate side okay I'll put off the wall should go straight middle off of that please don't miss oh my god is gonna go all right teammate huge huge touches we go for this once now I'm gonna just play this off the corner oh my god I'm almost scoring off of these puffle this is my heart I thought like we ready an OT game you can't pop in turn up teammates oh he bangs it Oh even nothing oh yeah actually did nothing the whole kidding but at the end bang let's go dude good job let's go I'll actually not well done well done they shot you got 551 m tomorrow to that game that's huge that's huge everyone that yeah that's high that was super hard there and that should not have been that hard but hey little hundred percent take that game one down these on right games gonna be really hard to get through I won't lie to you guys it's gonna be so random but let's just let's just hope for the best here you know out Adam you didn't do too bad considering it looks like that was probably his first ever game a rocket League it might have been as for Soviet rocket I don't know I don't know man it's hard to tell but you just look very lost it could just be lower rank 3v3 looks like I haven't played a whole lot of low rank TVT is like my first time playing it in a long long time so we'll see we'll see what we get in the next game but that scheme one down we got our first win reading scores single goal we almost did accidentally off the corner we got to be careful of those specially these lower ranks but yeah it's getting to the next and seeping keep it up let's go all right I'm gonna call kickoff no one was following that last time all right I don't think it matters at this right the rank the Rattler doesn't matter if you're talking off you still win all right Tyler's friend doesn't seem bad like his mechanics you can already tell he's not bad at all it's probably someone who doesn't play got my way dude so low standard look on the right side here okay this is already gonna be a super unfair okay nevermind that's a smurf never mind never mind never mind I might literally just a smurf account this would be interesting try to place high off the backboard or just backwards I gotta try to bump it this summer it's the only way we're gonna win this probably made us off the back there mom kill this guy kill one of them at least all right why is everyone like bumping each other in this rank okay one huge tip I can already give anyone is this low rank or just starting to put the game it's just don't go in the same corner is where your teammate is if the people that playing with followed that one single tip already a lot of their positioning errors would be fixed because they're just bunching up too close okay see if you waited middle there which I thought he still was good probably gonna go up in that middle city does nice try their team seems really solid my team doesn't exactly see my solid but let's hope for the best here trying to block that dude it's gonna be high he's gonna miss okay my teammates pop up again somehow see what Dad does here one more touch up middle that's fine all right I'm gonna fake this Charlie I hit this middle my teammate you got a belief all right dad alright man this series the series is gonna be so hard this is I saw this idea in the comment section right and I was like that's a good idea but I did not realize that like the low ranks associated or this like wow it's fine teammates teammates any of you alrighty ok he's up for that again teammate in the same position is me you don't want to be there I'm waiting for it to me to go nice let that go and real quick know these guys are like way too solid compared to my teammates alright what am I see they're both kind of just waiting back I like creative play middle you can go for that dad I believe in here alright my teammate is now permanent defense he's decided that is how he's gonna play it I'm bumped so let's see it alright well dude a bumpy I would've built the same sued our our win-loss percentage is gonna go so far down it says it's gonna tank so hard well my teammates fighting for the kickoff good start to this next play here all right like there's no there's not even a porter be passing this game that's the worst far as we it's like no way there's no possible way this is winnable I don't think nice alright alright positive I'm positive us I'm a challenge this yeah alright I my place down you're ready for a goal you got it Oh how did he get beat how did they get beat there there's two to my teammates dude this is so hard this is like so impossible it feels like you win a game like this first of might got afraid even for a while like I want so badly to just squirt what your goals and win this but I can't have I have to stay with the client even though this game just feels like super unfair middle come on dad I don't know that there's so much wrong with how my teammates are playing but then again they're probably very in there so you can't even really give them give them any yeah mister word slack my place out the back and just let it drop straight down oh I was trying to like not score and just have it flop in front of goals my teammates can just walk it in but they've already been there anyway trying to go for a kill of their past we can maybe do one more game I don't know if my brain can take on more these right now middle again are they gonna  too high from a whitey meter cable world if I had the guy in the other team on my team he'd probably able to hit them but the dudes of my team are reeling very well all right yeah I wouldn't know why I waited for my second teammate to go for the Paul oh man this idea like this series idea seems so good but these first these first few games no one knows how to do anything is gonna be very hard man mentally very hard to get through my hit this middle again no one's even remotely close so their biggest problems well what I would say is that they're not positioning in a way that they're supporting me in it at all like on offense like again another pass middle and he's super late to that ball like you you want to be pushed up away fair do I pass it middle again no there's no one's there to support when they are there to support that it's not sure how did I get read the situation it's over the whole team why should I get this middle at least one go come on yeah their team's like catching the ball they're all comfortable reeling my team they all don't know how to do any of that stuff yet yeah yeah so pretty unfair game caddie baby tips at the that we lose that it's just gonna be very hard to wait every single time but that definitely gonna stunt our our MMR increase if you already lost that early like could've just oh my gosh I hope you guys enjoy it enjoy this this the series idea and watching me struggle and have a terrible time and he's hurting it's not even about teammates faults like they're obviously very new to the game yeah I mean you can't really be too upset but the matchmaking there's a huge problem with the matchmaking here like this dude I don't think it's a sum everything the gamers didn't love this picture yet it's probably whatever rank this is or just doesn't play so center much but his mechanics work definitely definitely solid both of these guys actually could Ariel dribble the ball boom the ball easily but both of my teammates weren't actually able to do that yet so I guess the game can't really tell the difference between like 40mm are because these guys probably just don't play this place much and they just you know they have a good idea of how to put the game already whereas my teammates don't so that's something that the game can't really account for but that's just the beauty isola standard you never know we're gonna get right you know what I think I think I might end that one day that's a good start to the first video and I could read you guys's comments and see what you think oh man this is gonna be fun but uh but yeah that's that's two games out of ten down with lost 68mm or for that loss so yeah let's see what our our win right dropped to 96 off of that slowly dying slowly down but we'll see we'll see if we can get through the rest of our on right games hopefully not losing any more we'll see how it goes yeah hope you guys enjoyed the first like I said it's not gonna be much I can give you guys out of these first few games just because like that game right there is the simple of my teammates aren't experienced and either you can't use them I can't pass to them there's nothing I can personally do to make them be able to score against the players we're pointing it's because they were just better than their dear Amy so it's kind of a hard situation like that I can't really give you guys any tips now sense but once we get into like the slightly higher ranks like instead of plots of diamonds I can show you guys exactly how you want to be setting up plays and stuff like that but right now it's more so just hoping that my teammates get hit the ball and we somehow got one win we could have lost both games today already so not bad at all yeah B has enjoyed every stop a wonderful day or night
