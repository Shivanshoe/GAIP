yo what's up guys going to be playing some ones twos or threes today i'm trying out these camera settings what i used to use back in like 2018 when i won season six of rlcs but i'm using um 260 instead of 270 business right now so i'm trying that out hopefully it feels good let's get into it give me some dubs see how it goes all right the first time we got ghost and tied against sad thiago and lucy i think it's tiago x regional finalist title [Music] actually not sure who that is but the south american i think south american players based on their ping pong be very good so you touch and pop one time that team wants to follow you can actually really good job nice good job my team is crazy we could follow up on that probably positioning for my teammate like put himself in a really good spot to react to the pop regardless of how it came it should be okay never mind all good i did my job as first man just a challenge make them flick i did that whoever's behind me should be getting the follow-up there but live unfortunately my teammate own gold that's okay it's not a big deal let's save right behind should be empty for a second shoots off that [Music] i played off the back wall not a bad idea [Music] that's from time to control wait for double here and follow maybe a double tap forward there's a big hit board play open open space to the side all one more touch right on the wall here actually good soft touch for himself should be fine though seems like i'm the first person to challenge a lot on this team right now like my teammates don't like to go first but it's not a big deal as long as someone takes initiative to like actually challenge when they have um a controlled play that's like the biggest thing about threes gotta have someone that's willing to go in this situation all right that was pretty crazy shot i'm not gonna lie off the back wall to myself with a flip and then i have a really good angle around all of them there taking advantage of not having one back wall for that moment good presence of mine to actually look for that that's like pretty much what got me the goal there i was looking to the back wall and the fact that there was no one there nice touch it's a good hit back from them let me get our back boost here really good read i'm tied yeah touch on the wall let me go for this just in case i don't know if my teammates back or not it's okay to double commit there it's better we both go than no one goes in that situation i think try to take this back boost wait middle here if he wants to use me i'm here if not he doesn't have to i'm not gonna go for this though he's gonna have that on the back wall i should know what he'd be okay though let's follow this should be there should be a big hit should be okay still wait backward oh it was actually really close didn't have enough boost to actually get like a proper second flick on that but it's a good idea it touched my team and he keeps his position there so by not flipping into that he actually can go again it's really smart now he's actually in a position to go again if he wants to which i'm not sure what he's doing he put himself in a really weird spot after all that but it was still the right move early on look at her bumpy i love the little little passes crazy over one move up or bump another one put force to my teammate at least and i'm not going to score with all three back there it's mainly just to play it around them create some more pressure we did a good job with that too i should just go good job gotta rotate back here again you should just challenge for me i say done right middle if he wants to use me if not doesn't matter kind of the same situation that like shows this over and over again for bumpy i missed them that's fine that's worth it because again if i get the kill it's probably gonna be a goal so definitely worth to go for your wide weight out to the right if you want to use me but the back wall teammate can actually go for this if you want to just hit it around them that's the main goal good job don't need to go for a goal there but it's more just play into a spot that makes it really hard for him close good idea go for one bump quick before i leave and i go behind here and create some more pressure up missing it's actually a bad really bad miss but that should be fun try to get like the perfect touch and i made it harder when any touch would have been better than missing there that's perfect feels really good at the end make up for it two one no time left mainly just not make a mistake here not over aggress should be fun a little bit wide good try actually a really nice play though like the the pass to the wall really smart good uh double top goal for myself actually really nice let's get the next one though see if you can keep it up get back picked up for today see ya guys all right for the last game we got actually a really sweaty match here we got cheese and sosa against ajax sathya and thunder super sweaty match everyone in here is really solid wait for thunder touch here he was challenging so my goal is to follow up after instantly makes me second man at that point should i go for a quick shot right behind here i'm gonna wait for a touch i can't actually follow up quick to get hit wait for ajax touch put it left here good try that dude can't go he's gonna turn on this so i'm just gonna wait not a big deal if he turns wait for a shot here be fine let's play back wall again gonna have one more touch i'm trying to hit it up to open space to the right because there's no one there i would have had time to follow it up but what such that's fine because i went to teammate as long as you're looking to at least get it to a teammate i think it's a victory in the situation pass to the right would be huge and for solo that's fine ended up working past the right for sure was a goal don't know if you saw me though that's the thing unsure putting it back right for sosa like all the mid boost here is pretty big if i can bump thunder as well so i can't get to play middle a big save actually nice fake i like that maybe a double tap maybe even a goal a try [Music] i'll just block this so if he does job at least force them low that's the main thing there should be a goal i think good save actually if it's at the touch it's not going to be anything crazy good just play patient let's say sethi just sat back well it's a smart play there makes me like have very very little options or anything i could even do with that played around them that are right to my teammate i can actually follow this but actually no one's back that sucks should have been fine but no one was back for some reason it's also actually stayed up that's why i turned up field for a pass or something but there's no way that uh cheese on the wall could have got that passed him a little bit ambitious but wow main cells are definitely not on the same page at all but okay it happened it's also just ranked a big deal better bump him for him should be okay i'm gonna turn st middle he wants to use me give him an option close let's get a try your patience from saturday not to panic or anything and this game doing nothing is like a lot of times better than doing anything i swear doing nothing like almost always works out better than panicking or getting a a bad touch in those situations where it's a little bit awkward almost every time it's the better option try to bump them at least force this touch to be bad because it looks for a pass to the left could be big pass down give them some space with the ball and it gives me left as well they love the solo plays in rank three every time like i play these days i feel like everyone's just soloing everything definitely not oh wow who's coming in hot for that definitely not as passy as i'd like it to be i feel like there's so many opportunities where we just score off someone passing but it's a good example even the high ranks people are very selfish still that's okay without any boosts there to kind of pressure make them worry about the option [Music] controlling it is fine because awkward doesn't really have a pass option that's okay it's fine as well at least force them through the corner you may should be okay good job i have a lot of time now went off the wall i could still pass this maybe probably for touch let's see on the left side here like rotating opposite side of the ball is actually super good skill to learn for that exact reason it gives you like team that option to pass if they want to also using the walls like that is really good if your team's ready to follow it up most time i'm used to like i don't know g like again i was trying to pass just on a different page than the oh god only guys on the squad right now [Music] yeah using the walls like to your advantage using the corners for your advantage for your team is very important too it's not all about like direct passes it's not everything [Music] should be about a challenge nice it's a good pass from satya smart i almost guarantee this game will be one off the pass i can almost guarantee it that's the thing that's why i think passing should be done more people looked at like what really won a game more often than not it's actually a really good pass than anything else it's a good defense these days the solo plays don't really hit the same should be okay nice i don't really agree with like a lot of what's happening right now but i'm trying to play to the right side you may should be there it's fine should be okay it's so much time to deal with it good pass to leave [Music] shut the turn [Music] can i get a good fall but that's how i should stay back oh that was such a good play actually i like fake that had no more boost and i got back under it actually a player played off to saturday or so society i mean wait for double try this might just be the game sadly that's like the worst stretch to be and you're like trusting your first win look at the backboard read and he does it and it's just too late i don't know what's happening honestly are you expecting someone to be back and then no one's there every time but okay i'm learning i'll just play safer because it feels like not sure why i feel like we don't have a third man a lot of time so i'm just gonna play safer that'll be the one to look for the passes stealing try so this last man here waiting left side if he wants to use me history has showed me that i don't think he does but i still still wait there in case that's left here should be open space nice way for touch here it doesn't matter if he hits it really if i can get the bump it's good it forces it out to my team anyway i'm going to make a touch on that that's left okay well that was an interesting bb3 session for you guys i feel like it's not a good example of what to do in threes i was honestly confused 99 percent of the time in that game not gonna lie but we got the win so i guess it works but i don't agree with how it was being played anyway i probably make a video on my settings so i haven't made a settings video in a while so i think if you know what my settings are because a lot of you guys asked me and i don't have updated stuff in the description so i'll make that for the next one but hope you guys enjoy it to have yourself wonderful day or night every time this is watching like comment subscribe and see it on the next one love you peace
