going for super sonic legend again this season because last year we did do it and we did get the legendary baller title which is pretty sick i'll show you guys that right now while we're cueing where is it if i go to i think profile tag um legendary baller we got this we're getting super sonic legend in hoops the first time so let's go for it again this season i'm gonna be doing the rest of my placements and uh yeah let's get into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves tom against scriven lunar pretty sure we go for this i still like i play this game mode quite a bit and i still don't know which office mind to go for sometimes good shot from tom absolutely slaughtered it i'm just gonna say no problem and assume they're talking to me i'm not sure though i always like feel iffy about saying no problem because especially when i'm playing with another pro because i don't know what they're talking to a lot of time i know they just wait i don't say it until they say my name dave click my time here low 50 play up the wall now double plus there's like a try though i'm actually really smart almost use the bottom of my car to just sneak that in i know you guys feel about the louder game sound by the way i'm trying to like mess with louder game time for you guys not sure if you guys prefer it yeah let me know only way i can truthfully make the the viewing experience as good as it can be for you guys you guys gotta let me know your your thoughts and stuff i'm alone touch this probably gonna panic a little bit i can go for a 50. hit the boost i'll have full boost back here should be a good position for us to be in the block is pretty easy the backboard in hoops though you guys do enjoy hoops i'm sure there's a lot of players out there that love hoops although it isn't like a main game mode um make sure you use the back wall if you are a lower ranked player and this the backboard is literally a cheat code all right that's just gonna go in the backboard is actually a cheat code if you're smart and you play back wall then uh pretty much can't get scored on in this mode if they have to shoot it high you know you cover a back wall the only way you get scored on is if you get bumped or you miss obviously but if you're comfortable enough on the backboard you're not gonna make a mistake like that so definitely practice on the walls and stuff and regular game modes and it'll generally get way way more comfortable when it comes to back wall stuff and hoops i'll get one more on this another good touch almost a goal should have this pop it off the wall wait for his touch here again try to go back wall because even if he does get that ball high enough to go in i can probably get there in time and get a block on it not too much danger in that play it off the wall my teammate teammates should go for this good hit up back wall maybe even a double good try play to the side try to play back wall again like i said you see how little of an option he has there to score that goal has to be a perfect flick and even then it's going to be too high and it's going to be too obvious and readable or it's actually being my net that's the op stratton hoops always play back wall if you're defending there's almost no way to get scored on again he has to come back all here see he has to bump me it's the only possible way that they can actually get away with the goal in that situation you try good attempt on a double there try to make a panic go the ball away and hit it away one more time that's fine should go to my teammate nicely done wait for scribs touch here gonna be a free ball for us let me touch that again it's fine it should be okay i'm back well oh good i wanted my teammate to go there for a little bit he didn't end up going but he realized that probably should have been next up nice well done well done i'm gonna be going for the the slow kick off here in this give my teammate a free ball kind of the shot people doing like twos and threes kind of sweaty but it definitely does work yo slow to the kickoff or you try to 50 the ball in a way that it goes to your teammate more than likely puts you in a good position so i'm taking a pic definitely good first game though for today's video hopefully we get put pretty high up like grand champ one or two or something like that or for the dunk on them good try i'm also trying to slightly higher sense right now guys i'm trying one point eight cents on both sides actually like not even slightly that's like a pretty big jump from my normal use of 1.4 even further back if you go further back than that i used to use 1.2 all the time that's pretty pretty big jump but it does feel nice not gonna lie i think if i give it time and get used to it it's a nice change for me definitely makes the like game in general feel a lot quicker your car movements feel a lot snappier will you ever queue snow i do not like snow day at all i'm not gonna lie but i'll type that next goal to him i don't like how snow day feels if you guys want to see me play a snow day game i'm down but you can do a couple snow day games for a video i just i really don't enjoy that game mode that much i find it really hard to enjoy because you have to just sit on the ground that kind of takes away the whole aerial aspect of it for lunar here all right try to collect this ball on the back wall find teammate get it forward to me put it aside i don't think it was gonna be i thought one guy was back so i thought why not let me just hit it away instead of letting him get a touch control into the spot where i want it play to the wall and follow good shot good goal hold on i'll try to slow kick off again it saves your boost as well if they don't go before you can kind of fake over something weird he played really well though this game this whole game it's like been where he needs to be for saved and stuff like that played round one played to my teammate side he's not a boosting blank so i'll just hit this forward one of them's on the back wall as he should be smart oh oh i ran out of my flip for some reason i think i fell off the wall as soon as i use my flip so i just use my double jump right away didn't even give me the the chance i'm sure like whoever is the number one hoops player in this i'll tell you the same thing though the back wall just seems incredibly overpowered in this yeah good first game from us we played really well well done we'll be able to see what we get now where we get placed in we can queue up again hopefully we find uh another lobby pretty quick drop shot's good yeah i really like drop shot as well if you guys want to see more extra mode videos let me know what you want to see i like the xml videos it just gives me a little bit of a break from obviously the normal game so let me know what you guys want to see in terms of those videos all right good first game we got ourselves the grand champ one div four so we're not that far off of super sonic legend not crazy far off to be honest if we keep winning games we're probably gonna rank up one div per game so not that far off and uh i could probably grind it like in like an hour or two maybe get it so uh we'll see let's get the next one see we get off of our second game hopefully two wins for today and uh yeah we'll see how it goes all right for the last game of the video we're playing against universal and vatial things that you say that i'm gonna call him body and uh we got lockdowns on our team starts off with the absolute bang of a shot hit this to the ceiling hoping to get back around to that didn't really get a good shot of it so i figured when i hit into this power maybe my teammate could follow it up go for a bump here bump the back wall guy it's a little bit sweaty maybe i shouldn't do that in this mode playing for the dub though gotta do what you gotta do oh it's really tough really tough and uh in normal maps in the normal game mode i'm very useful i have like ten thousand dollars the most memory of that ball rolling up that lip and going out but this does not do that i go straight down which is very different all the time i have played would tell me otherwise in that bounce but it's all good got it right back something a little bit different about this map is it's smaller you guys probably noticed that a little bit smaller than normal and the ball's weight is also a little bit different so some bounces are a tad bit different than normal and especially around the corners corners are different the biggest difference is the the ones that go down right here the ball will almost never bounce straight down off of it it comes out most of the time whereas on normal maps that ball will normally come down and when the ball hits the lip from below it goes straight down instead of going out so it does the opposite of what it normally does in the normal maps now my teammate control this one more touch maybe should be fine we could just collect this on the back wall let my teammate go i heard him jump don't want to cut him off good clear from us he could touch this potentially so i hit this off to walk my teammate again uh accidentally double tapped it could have maybe been a pinch though or more to me back wall i think if you just banged it right away could have been something beautiful that's all good i respect that tim all right gotta go back wall here respect the shot playing get bumped i shouldn't waste any more boost after i got bumped there like the chance of me recovering that and actually getting a good flippies out of it so low season played through the corner though hit it around one i'll teammate it went at an unlucky time right as i was going back i ended up up into him right to the side try to follow myself let him touch that rotate behind well that was really hard to read holy couldn't tell my teammates touching it or not pass mid close i'm passing them like the the nets normally where it is on the ground we keep bumping into each other oh i know this is just going awful but it's fine might work might all be part of the plan i try to play it over one there's a good idea it's close i'm gonna fake this all right should be a goal after all that mess secured uh a free double tap finally was a really good fake though i heard him coming in behind us we faked the quick touch to the side we thought we were gonna clear it he ended up putting it right into where we ended up faking that part was lucky but everything else about that was a really good idea i'd say oh my you almost just slammed it into his net i should have nice my first touch here it's on the back wall just hit it to him see if he can convert hit try i'm for the more selfless play instead of just trying to do myself i want to see if you can hit the clip oh it's a good idea very close then i should go should realize i'm facing backward and go for me eventually did didn't think he'd turn again that was on me could have expected it i played through the water myself you may should have this now close good speed from the opponent good patience reminds not to jump but get bumped there it's pretty big demo if he gets it ah close close nearly the pinch we're looking for see it never goes straight down normally that bounce would go straight down right there that one too would go very differently it's a very tough one to read if you're used to the normal map obviously i played this game more and more it wouldn't be gonna be that tough but if you're used to normal that's a very very weird one to look at i think and know where it's gonna go after let's pass my teammate there we go good play i could play to finish it off scooped it up real quick all of this touch in the air nice pin straight down there what played up plate all right good games for today let's see where we end off with those two dubs ended up getting grand champ one to four i think so let's see what we got all right we didn't even rank up off that i'm surprised but uh i guess i'll take a couple more games than i thought but we'll get there regardless so we'll definitely go for supersite legend hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love you
