muffins you ready you ready yeah after like 8:00 tomorrow I will do it finally I have like nothing on the calendar we're chilling but yo what are we trying to do or we trying to like best best-of-five should we do like this alternate host every other cuz you're east right yeah so should we do like west east west east west is yeah yeah give you all the advantage that I need it bro I need it I'm telling you dog I've been driving Rumble I know I'm probably gonna siphon Rumble I'm not rolling in like six months yeah I'm telling you like I got all the secrets all the power-ups my strat is just the last the first 10 seconds of every kickoff and then hopefully I get a good power up yes anything goes anything go you can score whatever dude 1k on the line dog you gotta score at every fair warning I've definitely beat other pros but I've definitely got [ __ ] kicked by other pros it comes down to if I can if I just am I on my game you know that's what it comes down to ready alright guys so start out the lobby we're gonna be starting it on Westeros for the scissors here and we'll switch back and forth every single game like a net finalist okay there we go well switch back and forth every single game so it's Rumble default on West servers for the first game it's best of five the first three wins let's get into it let's see how it goes alright man city has been telling me that he's been beating pros and stuff in a rumble so I'm scared I'm gonna go for as many sweaty goals as possible man it's the way to go here try as many goals as possible before the ten-second timer last time he played he was a lot worse than now so it's gonna be a lot tougher than last time the last time was just a regular one we won as well I'll try they keep track of when he uses his power up so that we know another one is coming that's that's the biggest the biggest scare here yeah it's gonna be when he has his power ups because this man knows how to use every Power of perfectly and this key officers solid as well so we've got to be careful with that we're gonna take advantage of these ten seconds every time we can a challenge let's get off me people that use it no get the boot twice now hey Minnie is Boost here it's gonna force him to back off I have to make it now and what a save did I was the best thing you could possibly had there 250 for him this is sweaty dude I don't like it I don't like it I need more goals here all right you see you see her going back and forth in the car so that's so hard for him to get out of I know I got a freeze he's not getting the power-ups you need right now today's bang that one more time you got a freeze here therefore this no dude I think he got it I saw this shot I'll get patience this is sweaty dude I shouldn't know what for the the risky hardball there one can align I got a I play smarter than that this is risky as well are we got the boot at least I'll slow him down a bit no no no no no yes like why didn't I save my boot why didn't I say with you gara freakiness again until it's telling no sir a day [Music] it's a dude I'm choking man no carry good [ __ ] right now plays back man this is tea sweaty I don't like it it's gonna be super close I think what no way dude what happened what now was a question bugging him he didn't see what happened dude he's like grapple I didn't even like didn't work at all the safest is of any boost here I'm taking it with me no way no way alright you gotta go to this maybe if I to mess it up okay she's Fannie's he's too solid now no other space years give you go for us this fight is so broken man it's so easy to like bob and weave bob and weave like how do you defend this looks got a smart dude he tried to just like sit in front of me ooh you ready to kick off this time just save hope you didn't have anything here or at least nobody's on the counter to what I have okay no that'll do for now you're not gonna score that I start from the shoot one there's no way I get a panty did he use his power up again I save gonna go for that yeah power up soon again no no don't go II know I'm still falling okay you showed us part of vaccine as well I'm scared dude I had to answer challenge all the way around that cover II take a should be in go in - this is so sweaty ran this is only Game one listen I have the the Easter for next game there we go alright Game one secured man I wasn't intentional like that was actually really hard and zero second kickoff and you have that basically our car is teleport against each other and like we pinched the ball as Ratelle afford it oh it's a no it's not a known glitch but I figured that out no no whatever the first question was that was so attest whatever the when I put the first question mark I had the grappling hook and I kind of like launched myself today this guy but I see it just yeah yeah that's why I put that I wanna switch it to East will back out switch to you actually yeah I don't mind if you understand this alright alright but if it if it gets to like game you know if I start taking some games we can go east yeah good luck good luck you look alright game to you did you grab himself Blue team for me my first touch doesn't have anything for this give you a goal oh this is too much dude if my heart can't take this listen you're back yeah bang it may be hard from the turn that in at least uh-oh I don't know I'm not a control this thing Hey no way no way what let's go this is crazy you know that pirates so well like he's fighting him really well maybe you could shut up this dick control he's too solid them in when I put him the first time I was able to get doubles like that every time it work get it again there we go you got the demo oh my god I'm trying to get some nutty Shastra in town barely missing this in your heart no no this is the worst the worst decadent came from there please begin I think he has it he does I should have waited before I use that man I just should be good now but how do i fifteen that hard day should've been off my own wall she does oh my gosh no way fine kill let's go give me that give me that you don't want me to dude if he did that in time I think you gotta stop me I think it's time I would have just like flipped into their goal charge they said right well let's go for pinch no way dude top quarterback the quarter the car the shah's he has so much power bro I'm gonna top this once just bang it should be a goal there your goals in the first 10 seconds now man it's it's getting out of hand I think we got this in the bag this game I think we can keep it up how long's this never know though oh no not not a senior shot he's actually really kissing shots now no I was trying to get the I want to get the gold ever you pop up to the ceiling and bang it I'd be so not oh I could kill you kill you gotta fake this I don't want these scalpels I'm still in no dude I'm trolling you have the maintenance stuff no thinking right now or get rid good alright we have a freeze here also good time to use that mess up the finish up didn't have something for sure yeah I gonna bother going for that no way dude he's cracked oh no no dude no we haven't gotten they're going like a minute and a half easy to come back we need something I'll kick off here drop needs to go her away yeah it's not good does it demo at least might be fast enough nope got back try to make them laces power over you gonna kill me here that's fine recent time let's go dude let's go yeah you got a whole lot to your plunger when you have in a situation like this that's perfect hard to shoot that off of that was really good I'm gonna fake this and then go he thinks I'm not okay we should be good think fighting it back here we'll both die power up I'll use mine for defense I just bump away right away I'm gonna go for a nutty flick oh my god he had a plunger dude we're good though isn't enough time when they just hold on I think as long as you have a good kickoff here we good should secure the two I mean then one more game for the thousand dollars so see wait oh my goal keep it up Oh skipped it up all right good second game one more game dudes all we need big 1k in the bank if we win this but I think he's gonna come in hot this game dude this is gonna be his best game yet and he's gonna start turning it up for me he's not playing bad by any means man this is close this is close he still does have the west advantage here he pinched again oh [ __ ] just launches in oh I think I had to redirect just passing myself with the plunger right now wait wha why is he the goat with the tornado he's so good with the tornado that's funny out the patients on the backward there literally get from I was nuts or dude if I got that second touch in let's go dude the spikes coming in clutch I wasn't going for energy but regardless there but that was a really good power to get at that time I could just every well as much as possible make it really hard for it to know where I'm gonna go dude this slow kick off the slough kick off that was good that's good just slow enough so you went to the ball and it's not too dangerous from like he tried it again there we go I shave I got the boost I don't think it's in I had to Russia shot I need that oh my god here we go I keep getting that power up make some boost took my time they use a power up and then bang became really close to save me now does a good challenge man really good try fake this oh he's gonna got the Beast I use this to me shot sent how do you patient here he knows you couldn't get any backed off his right play I'll get the plunger let's go we stronger no we're not stronger no no why does it make it so much better oh hey dude the magnets just better man it's just Betty or he's just better one two taking it back he's got a booster panic the bit is saving wait what did he have I look so cool what the hell you just like floated to that ball I think it was a grappling hook like so cool already got 259 2 goals let's get it we come back from these save you'd to saw it on the backboard an out you saw it all around ship a little speed boost to get into it alright we gotta try to think more like a 1v1 play like even playing a high level one play we can't go for that kind of stuff off the backboard we got sure I think like that see more grounded go for power shots and such like that that'll get us to come back here is the high wall stuffs not work and he's too solid on the walls these days did you trying to kill the time should have something but what all right that was that was worth the can't cancel his uh his plunger out that was worth it I think she she does here he should touch one at the back off he's not backing up the bump dude as soon as I got bumped that backflip that that's not my momentum this wasn't enough there I should've went straight back me they after I got bumped there it's all good here's a couple quick goals here we'll come back home I use mine immediately after I don't know why I just panicked dude I panic what's wrong with me three seconds so he pulled together power back yeah he's ready I'm up again what am i doing get out of trolley I'm trolling McCoy were too much dog so you didn't take this game I think I missed by a bit wait II missed it's fine if you lose this game dude it's all good just gotta come back next game with a new mind but it's not over yet let's go do we have time three goals either we're coming back to this one we're coming back I have faith I have so much faith in myself need some good kickoffs here not bad nicely let's go two more goals two more goals within the first ten second timer dude if you get those we're good to go we're good to go for this low-key go off counter to good its save vacations no way no way so my gosh [ __ ] on he's gonna dude what can I do holy that's a good a shot he's coming back man I think he has this game for sure at this point where we can move on to their next and then if we lose that one I think we should switch to each series it's not too much a disadvantage for me right now but we said we're gonna originally switch back and forth but you have it lose the next any scheme five then I'll put on East my next game we're going full serious mode dude no room to mess around here alright I'll get you to one to one well play well played that's you yes say let's go Game three I took a game we could go to east now we can go to East for bad no it's fine it's with you if it goes even further research okay if it goes to game five you're fine with playing game for honeys [Music] no dude it's just see I'm not consistent I can make B saves I can make these shots but the next play I might just with the ball no I know all right game for let's get it alright boys to the one right now we win this win the shoes that's that focus right now we can do it I believe that's us just once you go back here once too late for his power mighty go for this you know something there we go I think I think you went too far forward it's a range right now I think you had plunged it look like it plunges driving forward for that anyone just had a range yeah kick off their free one-year no way no way he gets back yeah no it's too fast man I'm gonna put y'all unexpected kind of taking them off taking it back try kill time till you get sparrow she's gonna get here a magnet okay the guy's a swapper dude no oh hey hey hey Tikku I didn't want patient on that in a way maybe actually like fake going for the ball just so he uses his fries I got to go an extra step a patient save at the kill he's fighting to spawn and it gets fought yeah all right she'd be good we know use his power another diver in a good position here sure he does all right he messed me up just enough there oh no no what have I done what have I done no time dude this is all going so downhill so quick all right go kick off a key focus focus I could do this good we got it back we need some more we need some more give me two more of those nice little buffer he's doing slow kickoffs they're doing quick I got the killer she's good that spikes as well no we had the best counter for that dude I just like locks on Trevor the ball this alright she does with that oh no I did it just lost more shots on sorry man I hope for the past so you hit the crazy shot that he does that somehow she does should be in there yeah he just booted me away so I figured my card messed up right now like it's on the side so might as well switch with him I'm gonna fake this one again there we go huge challenge it huge let's go we brought it back to you they brought it back one keep it up we're not we're not giving up now though we're not gonna let off the gas ain't over yet one for the boosts smart play I'm gonna grab some pads there probably expect me to have a full year it's gonna be in I guess with them oh my god okay fighting switch I think I'm buddy got scored on hit him back corner that is actually freezer did Oh because my arrow button is my home Mike my arrow right button is my item button it's not gonna use this dish eat miss again I could have drove toward him and and booted him got him in the play the save and that's gonna be hard every time it's really a shot for him get kick off and get this boost there we go dude just speedy enough right now baby I'm good rumbling a wild man so this all feels so weird to me I forget how to use some of these power-ups to the best of their ability huh you got the bump and got the ball they'll actually nuts find a buck me dude there we go patience paid
