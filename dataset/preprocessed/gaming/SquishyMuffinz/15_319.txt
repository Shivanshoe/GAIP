yet but I'll announce it when it happened so yeah subscribe if you're not already let's get into the video enjoy Yodas up guys in the last video of our soul standard wrote to grand champ without scoring we finished off at 582 MMR at 2 games place yeah let's get into some more games and hopefully there's some good ones pretty even in terms of MMR I think I gotta remember to call kickoff I always forget should I grab that I should tap it middle I think when I team it today FK yes he is he is back though we're good this is a full almost the full console Lobby here I'm waiting for my team nice try to use our space here we have some space just use it wisely I just tapped that middle for Fat Joe do it to him close when you have space in threes don't be afraid this one of the ball and get a dribble going I feel like a lot of people they're afraid to do that but you shouldn't be I wanted to leave that above the go I'm so not used to like trying not miss four of those I notice a lot of you on these lower ranks too they put like permanent defense like he's just sitting in gold a I'm just gonna go for a demo it's it's so awkward with a teammate like passes me the ball it's like I can't just go in for this shot right away I'll play this off to my teammate side so I'm looking forward there so whole lives are really a fast I'm not gonna go that I'm not gonna go I need to back out a lot earlier those that my teammates push up more they're more defensive okay for a year I'm just trying to fake challenge bait out the flick like we were talking about in the twos and ones rated grand champ put it out left side got a space thing I gotta stay on this might tap it up once and I play this middle to Fat Joe alright he pretty jumped out you don't really want to be pretty jumping especially its own Center we have no idea of your teammates gonna do but I was putting that right in front of him there is leading to Monterey pass had he waited it's probably gonna be a goal for us but good try and this looks like they can fly and we're comfortable with the idea of a really be starving them a little bit they wanna go on offense they don't have the mid boost or corn abuse to do so I'm gonna my teammate go here he's like he's aim is boost maybe didn't have any yet I don't know feel like you should have there it's like one touch here another one is just photos middle Fat Joe okay I'm gonna go for this hit around one child like my teammate up middle again yeah no one just like there's no one in support when you're playing ranks too slow okay we're good and everyone's very panicky and defense so they honestly if you're trying to get better at threes if you're good at once or you've played ones in the past you'll be you'll be good at threes because you know how to slow on the ball when you have a space and you know how to destroy to get by people like that create opportunities to my teammates white and now I'm left in a one on three luckily everyone mr2 50/50 middle teammate should go two of them one again so by teammates Adel aquitted on three of these balls in a row again this is a lack of knowing where everyone is please don't go in I have to save this ball I was in all right we're good Timmy should have I'll turn on this try to keep the ball close here so I can set up another place I'm gonna hit up the wall please down middle okay I need to do like much simply much much simpler stuff because they're jumping on it everything these are all very horrible chances if they just wait but obviously no one's like ready for that so let me just hit it up there and see what happens I'll try to go for more of the the curve approach and this is like this is probably the sloppiest gameplay that of all the all the modes he played in the lower ranks this is easily just sloppy I think a little bit there lets you high for them yes let's do I gotta try to keep the ball low but they're not positioned for the low passes a lot of the times the only problem so again we're keeping the ball on a spot where we can create something out of it and there we go straight middle teammates you should have that to try again try to just beat this guy hit it over him he might see me went with me so I applied to the corner when again my foot is just not a lot of trust when it comes down to these drinks no one like believes in each other what everyone's capable of doing I was good Trotta bomb no okay they're both for the cat every time there's been a chance to shoot my guy is lost back has been going with mother teammate who's already waiting for word which you shouldn't be doing every should be aware I realized that nothing is gonna come of you both going for something like that I'm gonna leave it right there let's go dude I love the tea you loves the tea I gotta do more stuff like that literally just floats in front of the goal like it's almost impossible miss and again they both win even for the game-winning goal they double commit okay guys if you are lower rank and your final get better at 33 again just really focus on not being up your teammates ass okay your teammates going through your ball spaced out for them be ready for the next touch don't you write next time don't be covering the exact same option is then because if they go for that ball and you go for it as well who's gonna be there for the next touch no one I'm very bad that book me and that happened multiple times that game so that's just honestly it's not a hard thing to to look for and not a hard thing to fix at all but you have to be like visually aware that your teammates in front of you and you have to trust him to get the hit you can't you can't just always have no trust for your team in and go for every single ball that has a huge problem from Fat Joe there's Fat Joe doing it the most where my other team would be in front of him and then he would go as the guy that's behind when you see the guy in front of you half the weight you have to wait he created so many awkward situations on defense we got to 1 B 2 or 1 B 3 they're in that game and there's just so many unnecessary situations that we created and there's a lot of chances where if they waited or played more patient or trusted each other a little bit more than B more goals so there's there's a lot of trust and it's a lot of just knowing their teammates in and get that touch middle and knowing that teammates gonna win that 50 and waiting on that 15 being there for the next shot so it's a lot of what it is and there's a lack of obviously that major thing in this rank so let's get the next game see if we can get to back-to-back wins I'm glad we got the clutch win there but there's still way too close these games are super close to super sweaty but it makes for some good content for sure we try to get a lot of passes middle and again the main thing you see me doing here to create chances you're just looking for first opportunities to control the ball get it around want to get it around too and then try to just get a ball middle and the biggest issue is obviously missing are always ready and y'all just can't control that the lower ranks but the whole point is you want to try to create those opportunities by using your space don't just throw the ball away every single time you you get the ball like there's no point of doing that obviously instead of situations if you're low boost and you're getting pressured really hard boom the ball as far as possible get as much time for your team to get boost and then on the next play try to control the ball but if you have time you have space you have the boost you know try to create a pledge try to go forward and make a pass happen that's what I've been trying to do and yeah let's get into the next game hopefully we can get the two back-to-back wins though for today's video all right so not too bad MMR's a pretty even only thing is I can't score and I'm not is MMR here so why is it everyone always in F King beating these games oh he's not afk okay got around to there I'm not gonna state middle guy can't score so I'm not setting out that's my teammates pointer rotating he is rotating in wall okay using a lot of his boot I just wanted to meet a lot of  there to go for that mid boost I thought he did turn okay he's playing full time defense so note of that my other teammate I have no idea where he is I just like check the whole field oh I made him that's not me that wasn't me let's go dude that was nuts that was actually now that's 200 IQ that's 200 IQ I didn't touch the ball i bumped him into it I bumped him into it I made him pool shot you know my teammate got the goal I technically didn't cheat you know I mean I technically didn't cheat that's the way around it I didn't think of that Oh No oh no oh no no we needed that goal we needed that lead they both went that so lucky no teammate job maybe didn't think it was in vogue it though others just super unlucky both of them went classic solo standard most of them wedding that happened to we're both going now oh I'm part of it okay I'm using my space look at my face I have on the field again I cut this one you're gonna have this space still let him touch that away that's fine my team is a free ball now miss my mom I can rotate behind okay another miss another miss cool and my team is playing that over there I'm gonna hit off the wall see my teammates do you I'm trying to kill this guy I gotta try to make a pass middle then just go for a demo my team is playing full-time defense is gonna be so hard I'm just gonna beat this guy off the backboard off the backboard again all right I'm gonna try to play full time defense to make my teammate not play full time defense actually I don't know I know the players you know I just got to use my Batmobile play four goals stay right there all right my team is there for the clear surely he doesn't get scored on his full-time defender right it's over one middle see it's bad when you play really far back like that well maybe in these lower ranks it's not as bad but when you probably fall back like that the problem is you're not there to challenge the dribbles so you're leaving yourself in a much worse spot and it seems like everyone rotates all the way back in this ring is so weird you never wanna run sit all the way back you want to have a good position to the point where I shot whatever like why is he all the way in goal is so weird it's so weird to see for me that people think that you have to play goalie you don't have to play goalie you're you're wasting your position if you're sitting in gold like that it's very interesting to see that's the mindset of both of my teammates the same my ball must go straight in again again like he was sitting and go the whole time but me just coming back to go I was able to get back to that whereas he was sitting and going it was so easy for him to get because he has no momentum gonna back off your teammates should go it gets fun I have to save this I guess fun I was I have to get around anyway I'd rather him just Huff's it away okay I let my team a touch nice played around one a dunk I made this off the corner now should set up my teammate for a shot plate up the wall try to play this to the wall again so I came to the shoot so fun to keep it in a spot where I can't accidentally go in challenge that okay no one's middle so I was looking for a past middle but again they're on top of each other and this the the main thing that I've been bringing up in the last two games that I played before this was that everyone just seems like they're on each other's ass like you just kind of spaced out more it's the main thing that I'm seeing again like no trust teammates already in front of you and he goes for that ball my child touches one more time and then take it to the side here and I'm gonna try to play this middle teammates so far back but it's fine I'm gonna show it's a behind we have a gold lead here so really we just have to play good defense game it's on the right side so that's good he's actually not fully back I was gonna pass her it to him but it's fine my teammate went so we'll back off touch it over one like I take their visas good also try to make sure you take as much boost that please now oh my god that's horrible trying to take as much boost as possible and on the offensive end it starves them out makes them have to play a lot slower and it gives you a huge advantage for for making plays especially in a higher level games you need to boost I absolutely need to I go for this ball should be until you want to take me out put in middle as well but again my teammates because one is literally sitting in goal and the other one just rotates all the way back as well no one's almost ever gonna be there for those midfield touches and it when they finally do you go for the top they sell out double commit and finish it in my in my net so it's interesting to see for sure right a new experience try to get a kill you my teammate put a little bit more forward a lot more swamp to be had and just rotations are just a lot slower than they should be surely they save this alright we're good okay we got two wins for today not bad at all these games are so close uh hopefully we could start getting full like 700 mm or la because it seems like the players are playing that are like five like this guy's father or more he was he was more solid than 300 more footage of playing so 300 silver I'm guessing we were ready up to gold or over gold maybe Platinum I'm not sure to be honest but those are the games done for today guys I hope you enjoyed the games were 4 to 10 played and we're almost at 700 mm are already with one lost one game but yeah it's probably be a lot more losses to come I think hopefully we can finish off the rest of our our placement games without losing too much but we did really good today I'm happy with the 2 wins came through same issues I'm seeing from the previous two games just the spacing is really bad people don't understand that you should it rotate all the way back into goal we should try to stay middle to have an option available but again that's just the lack of experience and that's something that these players probably just don't know yet that's the whole point of this series if you're brand new to the game just avoid doing the things that you're seeing my teammates do a lot of this stuff rotationally you just want to avoid completely you wanna try to give you your team in an option always be in support with your team even when they're moving upfield trying to have someone there to help out with every 5050 every touch middle try to have someone there to connect on the next touch and I can't wait for we are playing the more aggressive more offensive players because we'll have more opportunities to make those passes and create those plays and they'll actually be there for them and yeah you'll see how useful it is to take your time in 3v3 and slow down the ball you don't always hit the main that ball were that's a big point I'm gonna be covering throughout this entire series don't always bang the ball away control the mone at the time and trust me it'll help your game a lot but yeah it's off astray guys I hope you enjoyed the video and as I mentioned in the last and I think the video before that I've been starting to talk about it
