yo what's up guys gonna be playing tuesday today with gyro should be swinging a game let's get into it let's even get some dubs see i guess all right ourselves daniel and x there this goes i'm not sure your x's to be honest i know daniel is obviously solid definitely recognize daniel x is probably a smurf i'm guessing maybe just someone with their name change something like that this is a very high uh mmr lobby everyone in here is very solid i bumped the last man back made him jump there we go that's well played so he has to worry about my flick there that little fake pop that i did makes not to worry about the high but i also have all the low and vision in front of me i could see everything because i do a little pop it separates the ball from my car so it gives me a little extra bit of vision and i see that i have that whole low area of the net to myself but i was well played there almost always best case scenario and those lovely ones is it throwing a little fake probably get some vision of the opponent see where they're coming from see what their ideas on defense and go from there it's almost always the best case today gonna cheat here i like the soft sheet most of the time a little bit further back from the ball that way i can definitely make contact on it and if it gets a little bit behind me i could go because sometimes it does you can get back there pretty easily let's play it around them double if he doesn't have let me go straight back here fine i blocked the potential shot angle it's going to be really tight really hard for him to score but i think he was trying to go for it if it wasn't there that's quite unfortunate to get dunked there should be okay put it around one try to push him and hit it away which is good try to kill the other guy his support it's a good save play down field play for the shot close unlucky it's not worth going wide to the wall there i know he's waiting well for me but it's not worth going wide to the wall when it's an empty net the wall is really good for when someone's back got to be annoying get in the way try to make things a little bit more difficult for them really it's a very tough one to make this a 50 i still have 50 boost which is the best part about that 50 is i don't waste all my resources for it i feel like that's actually quite bad if i have no boost after the fact but that still did keep some it's actually really good for me should be okay for me to get back here control this should i play it around one maybe gotta bump the other one he didn't jump i went all in on this so i gotta go back really quick i don't know if i can even get back for this yeah i can't unfortunate very very ballsy ball to go in for because i am stuck in their net went for a bump on one and even if he does get the dunk on that guy most likely it's going off the wall either left fall right wall or their back wall and there's no one there to follow it up because i'm stuck in their net so i don't think gyro would probably go for something like that because at the end of the day two days left in the season it doesn't matter kind of just trolling both of us having fun should be okay here that was back ball don't know if i can get back yeah quite unfortunate should have been okay in theory i think he could have had it i think he was worried about getting dunked maybe try to get the perfect touch i'm not sure you know down to the ground here should be gyro's ball i have time i'm just going to control this oh yeah it should be a goal i'll play you don't be controlled because obviously i don't know if the demo is coming through if i do the demos coming through i would have shot right away the different story i don't know the demos coming through secret trillions are the best option there this option that covers both scenarios try to fake them because i know i couldn't get a shot of that i don't want to get 50 even harder into our net though fake is a good alternative for sure there's an awkward spot to get out of do get out of it though i'm there if he misses and i have as well played you have to sit there but you might have faked them okay ah jar was going very all in on these balls and i can't really help him out if he gets beat so he has to be a little bit more patient as as last man these situations it will be okay not much i could do when i'm stuck in their half a couple other spots like the timing on those challenges are unlucky too because you didn't see what's happening to me or i got stuck in the half you might not see it let's get 50. i should have this i don't know if i can get back okay i can is there a boost here still no boost he's trying to get away as much as i can good win from well done that's okay i have to be super patient there because i didn't know what was gonna happen i didn't know what was gonna come with that it was very confusing that was super weird it's your appropriate situation gonna play safe here again safe cheating i'm gonna play it to the far corner let's hit it to my side and play it back now i'm gonna be annoying don't stay on this ball go for a 50 it's going to slow down their push a little bit jar should be back should be going for this should have it should have it all right it might get might get risky now we're good for a second not for long oh my gosh that should have okay it should have been a lot easier maggie but we'll take what we can get we'll definitely take away okay all right good first game let's get the next one tv keep it up get back to back that's today hopefully it's a little bit cleaner than that one let's see how it goes all right last time we got ourselves a rematch here here those goes if it's equally as messy of a game let's go cheat there take a little bit slower gotta wait back for jar he's not back to help me out quite yet oh i got fake unfortunate i thought he was gonna 50 and he never did he kind of just drove next to the ball so bad mistake for me i honestly flipped the wrong way it would have been fine diagonal flip instead of backflipping again he's just faking over and over again so should be just playing a little bit more facing on the the challenges not expecting them to go for 50s it's a good challenge there because i don't go all the way in i don't dive all the way in i don't use my flip or anything it's not a bad situation for us most of the time nice from gyro this is the game where gyro pops off 100 i can see it nice i was gonna play from us there only real option there was just to go above them can't really go left to right there because we have both guys one guy covering the right side i'm gonna cover in the left side so above is the only option that they really have someone a good spot for the best spot for that would be back ball and then have someone winning back wall for me so it's always going to be okay to go for something like that it was always going to put a good amount of pressure on them first thing all this booster you messed up first challenge i'll take my time on that land on it get a decent 50. drop from gyro to stay grounded there on the wall 1v1 situation really well played tried to snipe a shot actually made the panic quite a bit which is good i could pass it back he somehow pre-jumped it i don't know how he could see the future uh that's a good idea but bad execution good idea bad execution for sure there i'll play from jarrah trying to get a reset back there off the wall off a flip as well which would have been crazy good idea gotta go all the way back here jars gonna be first challenges off the ceiling see what happens easy ball for me to clean up take a shot on goal good touch to keep it in you have to have that on the back wall not a very awkward spot here to be honest one of them's waiting for all their boots falling down for a while and the other one has to retreat so i got to get a weird touch maybe follow it up myself try to do something weird that'll throw them off they know we're in a good position here i'm lagging a little bit pc is dying to be easy for us though let me go for this split forward didn't realize jar was bumping again or i would have taken more control of that ball been pretty tunnel vision on the ball it's a mistake i've been making in these games played over one here go for the bump on the other there we go that was a smart player good play from us we passed some jar originally get touched off the back wall round one and then wait for the other one to jump hit the bump give gyro an open net the touch from gyro installing it's all three seconds for me to get back nice he actually got away with that i don't know how we got out of that with a goal we will take it we definitely take it get all the way back here jar of the mid boost it's fine he's shouting off the ceiling again so if he gets beat i gotta wait i might have one more flips i gotta wait here should be a little boost at this point way back wall good double save there could have saved the first one better so we hadn't made the second save but still ended up working out not too bad of a situation full boost here and waiting for java to get behind me once he is i can challenge this i know that i'm in a safe position let me go for the pump there we go leave the jar with yet another empty net easy one to slot home 58 seconds three goal lead unless you make some really big mistakes here or they go for a bunch of these kickoffs i get some free goals it'd be okay in theory to be okay this is the spanish kickoff it's called the spanish kickoff yeah it goes for kickoff goes for the demo on the cheater and if the kickoff taker which was gyro in the scenario doesn't spot it out in time and passes them the ball it's pretty much the free goal every time that's a very tough thing to pay attention to catches you off guard even if you are looking for it you don't expect it in ranks because these guys must have typed that to each other to pull it off gotta stay in front of that it's well played only way out of that situation really i'm gonna fake challenge here that's fine i don't mind if he has full control your jar is behind me flick's not gonna do anything for them so i'll take that situation every day better pop this one more time maybe one more off the wall should be good for jara it's faking that why is it working all right eventually it won't it works so it doesn't works so it doesn't a good game for today though very interesting stuff very uh classic to be tv games weird stuff all around that's gonna be awesome guys i hope you enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time this you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe but i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
