yo what's up guys going to be playing some tubes today with aqua it should be some good games let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves against calm and race bull i'm off a little bit of a break guys so forgive me if i'm a tad bit rusty but hopefully we can still come out with the wins for the day obviously still going to be going for the the devskis wait for his touch here the balls are rolling so his only option is to kind of just play it into me and if he does that then i have someone behind me anyway the chip up there is that definitely the only thing you can do to actually make that somewhat threatening but if aqua is back there's like nothing they can do still just enough speed beat the last guy still got the speed yes sir i was telling him i was on a little bit of a break so i might be a little bit rusty yeah still got the speed like riding the bike you never you never really forget you know i've only been not playing for like three days i haven't had to scream we're kind of all on a break right now energy boys at uh at a house right now content house couldn't make it because the coveted restrictions but hopefully i can see the boys soon been a while i miss them i don't even know how i was able to save that to be honest unfortunately i didn't get uh he didn't get damaged right there i was full speed and he just got bumped somehow unfortunate happens goes for the solo play here pops himself i was a good 50. i thought maybe i got to get enough contact on the 50 that would be a goal gotta be careful and get back here a team bump almost messes up a little bit he's gonna have one more touch here side away patiently show on this it's fine cover the only angle toward cool get this boost i'm going to sit back well again it's not going to get anything out of this unless i make a big mistake if i just play patient there's no danger really no flip do you try there good touch from awkward won't be one now and i'll be made if you want to use me nice a lot of pressure on them right now which is really good for us let's block him keep that pressure up really attached to himself to try touch this it's fine it doesn't matter to be honest he gets that touch doesn't do anything bad for us as long as we follow up our next play here with something good it's fine all you can really do is bang it away i'll hit it right for me i just block a mirror i can only hit this left so if i get right underneath the ball and get a good block on it it's coming from the right side so all you can do is hit the left right that's how i know to just get under it block more of the left side and it's actually really good to our opportunity if i do that correctly i get mid right boost here i'll fake challenge first i'm not going to full commit i want to make him jump that jumps good now aqua can charge for me and now i can go nice little rotation deal with the dribble there they pop pogba can touch this most likely nice oh wait here it's going toward them i can't be beat into this ball take this as well make him just hit it away should be awkward ball here nice it's gonna pre-jump it's fine should be okay i missed the boost which kind of sucks but he's panicking a little bit so you can probably bait up this ball here there we go three 1v1 now i can kill the last guy back as well make it even more difficult on them there we go good initiative there to take advantage again he's in a 1v1 situation i know the last guy back i just baited the ball up for my team made him hit it away gave him a free 1v1 if i kill the other guy that'll be there to support and i have no help in that play really good save works as a fake i don't know whether trying to fake it but it works as a fake got his boost which is good i played his back to him good fake there good 50 as well should be in under the bar nice we'll definitely take that all right good first game though it's all stuff really tough opponents two are all cs players and play pretty well almost dropped a thousand points not bad not bad against the next game steven keep it up get back to back dubs for today's video but yeah let's see if we can uh get another dub here let's go all right for the last thing we got percy and zaccion i think is that you say that the x names always gets me i'm never really here if i'm pronouncing them correct i think i am i never feel sure i'll just keep it in i'm gonna go for a mid boost here if it's back you got it which is unfortunate i can just go back that's fine mind this play back ball block the net big challenge bump him out now gotta watch the bump it'll be fine take my time here let him hit this into me fine or play it back still have the ball here actually really good touch puts a lot of pressure on them if aqua doesn't get beat hard here we actually be in a really good spot fine let him pressure again i can't really win this wall yet i can wait get a 50. it's fine i still saved all my boosts as well that's why i like doing that being patient on those really good still saving my boost fine just challenging aggro for his teammate trying to be annoying touch from aqua one more you try to beat him to this it's fine he's falling i know he has none if i just take this from him that's actually big just take that corner now fine makes him panic his next touch which is really good for us one more over him it's okay gotta play this a little bit patient i can beat him to this ball now my challenge again he's playing patient last back i like that because it gives us back the ball like a high touch here we're just going to throw it away for a sec play back to myself never going to commit on that i know that i don't even panic take our back fleece now that's going to be bad maybe i'll go flip into it should be okay i don't like flipping this up in the corner especially if i'm last back i feel like almost always results in the goal against you but ended up working out for us even though it probably shouldn't have to be honest if your last bag just stay like grounded fake challenge make them throw it up the wall like make them play their hand early and most of the time they'll get the ball for free you get a clean possession out of it and your team can obviously get back which is ultimately what you want in a situation like that actually got it past them like no boost somehow i don't know how i did that i should be my challenge here finally messed up as touch almost on gold as well i'm gonna pressure him i got the ball here now play it over should we just touch one more touch here take a shot forced to say which is good now he has to dribble that's the solo board i can go for this my teammate made him waste a lot of boosts to just vertically go over me which is going to give him back all the free ball there it's fine if it gets over me most of the time then doing a pretty good job of getting it by the first guy just putting a lot of pressure on them every time and saving my boost when i have it which is really important that's one of the biggest things in twos always i feel like it's just saving your boost when you have it i didn't realize there's any bump there i would've just went for the straight up shot i was in between a shot and a double tap because of that i my brain kind of just split in two i didn't get either of them yeah i had i seen the bump a little bit earlier it was obviously an empty net did we just shot it it's a good bump one of those things that like if you're in comms and you can call that early that he's going for that it's um obviously going to be a really good play every time there am i insta jumping for this i thought percy was under it to be honest that's fine i made it to flick by doing just nothing pretty much just kind of sitting there trying to be annoying again make him jump in the corner let him touch this pass back should be fine i'll take my time let him play it into me here got around one again made a situation really awkward as well made him have to end up backward there just double jump it back into aqua it'd be fine wait for his touchy i really wanted a better flick there it's unfortunate good games though good set again for sure they're sweaty though very very sweaty hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you're watching this like
