yo what's up guys we're playing some threes up for today with uh left and wonder mike so we got a pretty good squadron getting my threes ranked back up round one maybe the bump on the other look at try i need to slow the ball down a little bit more i think before going for the bump it's close though right idea i'm gonna be there so i'm not gonna continue to waste my boost i'm gonna land and grab this one like the mid as well let's control the boost i know both my teammates have boosts there so it's more about just making sure they can't get anything out of it really get a good player on that so i'll just drive in try to stay relevant midfield here there we go just stay at a spot where i can react to like whatever happens and try to be in a good spot that if it goes wrong i can get there and if it if it goes right i can get there as well and it went really right for us they made a little bit of a mistake on the goal line but it was a really good play from uh from other mic to create that space that's 50 right left here i'm trying the shot had you seen me like mid i think he would have passed because it was like pretty wide open no one would have covered me but he probably was like really tunnel vision on that shot and it happens a lot especially with no calm that's why comms is so important good win putting it over him here tried to beat him to the next one couldn't quite put a bump in the last guy back here gonna be open for at least a second here there's a window that was it was horrible it's good that let's actually run for it save get some pads here try to turn middle again being a spot where i can help out if if he needs it he doesn't need it but i'll definitely secure the goal get air dribble for sure but so valuable these days to make sure you have like in a pro team all three players can do those um you know those mechanical things i think it's just really valuable to have players that can create that space you know open up so many options just by taking the ball solo one time you don't want to do it every time i think it's a bad thing to do every time but definitely sometimes it's the right play wait a second probably the backflip let's find it when it takes that i can still be middle to help out he doesn't need it nice little slicing dice i actually like the initiative there to take that from me because his angle was much better than what i ended up with you could do a lot more with that than i could back there good save my first touch here again just waiting mid into a spot that i can react to both situations here i'm gonna have to go back while i think just in case this goes wrong one touch off the wall it's gonna be hard for them to go for and should we get from my teammates save can't really block them but i can at least force this angle to be bad on that ball it's ceiling here pretty quick plus should have a free shot maybe let me all the way back that one might take the mid boost give him again a free opportunity on the ball good touch feel your control here you can pick the next touch fake the wave dash go for the boost oh if i got that boost and got the the next pop i was going forward crazy but high into a spot that they're not gonna have a good time trying to stop pop it up again notice how like every touch i'm making i'm trying to make it as weird as possible for the opponent it doesn't even matter if it's going toward their net it's more about taking it around them trying to like just dwindle their resources down right again i'm just hitting it over all of them i don't need to go for a shot soon to keep on doing that until eventually they get to a spot where there's really no way out right and right now they're kind of in that position already they're getting suffocated if left ones this ball can get a shot maybe i took this back right i'd say we're still in the upper hand here like they're reacting to all of our touches off all these plays so there's really no point where they regained control of the game every single touchdown was more of them reacting to us then i was having to react to what they're doing which is the position you want to be in almost all the time in rocket league you want to have um full control of the field the pace of the game where the touches are going who has to react to what that's the big thing right stand the next game see me keep it up get back to big dubs see how it goes all right same guys sweaty game here yet again good kick off so back here full boost trying to move forward though a little bit just in case and he doesn't need it because he's just out playing the whole squad hold on so their mistake there okay andy the guy on the ground just trusted whoever was challenging a little bit too much right you want to be able to cover both options even if it goes um wrong like that right you want to be able to be in a spot to cover both i think having trust your team is good but also covering both options is more important because no matter how good people are there'll always be mistakes that they get made right i'm just going to bait this i don't have to actually challenge it's more about just making it hit the ball to me 50 would be huge now he gets a free shot there we go i thought i was in before there was a 50. not trying to go for a go out of that again let's put it into a spot where it's very tough for them it's just rolling in front of their net one of mine's going to have every option available to him you can fake that hit it off back wall pass back if he wants to off the back wall go for the shot like he did the shot's probably going to be a goal 90 of the time there so hard for the defender to actually do anything about it control here good boom as well clear danger i should be back here i'll just go behind him hit save played over one one of mike's already up i was crazy looking almost almost slaughtered at home let me go for this again why not so they keep turning at the same spot because we have a lot of pressure here again right so as long as i can keep going for these these touches over them and just making their their life as awkward as possible we're gonna have a really good time in their half not really have any way out for a bump here again you throwing some bumps with this as well two demos look how awkward their situation's gonna be they have two guys on 33 boost and one guy having to do all the work and there we go eventually we just got a goal out of just the suffocation and the pressure that we have stay full boost here again i'm just gonna challenge this break them out should be let's ball for free now should be fine for one day even though he's opposite side could still get it should be okay wait for his touch to me maybe pass back to wanda [Music] delta change his name to pop tart what the heck for the next touch oh it's actually going to be good for them oh it's actually really good play it's close again one bump though if you do have that suffocation like that really good rotation going and have a lot of pressure like that if you get like one big bump especially on the third man that that is massive good demo from them it's not my platform to be saved let him touch that let him hit this as well doesn't really matter take the boost more valuable to me to just like make the ball be awkward for them and just take their boost there than to even try to go for a goal off that there's no point hit it off the wall i should beat him now i have a free opportunity to hit it off the wall again i'm not gonna expect it probably plus save my boost here there we go try to just follow this up myself hopefully it doesn't go straight in right right there i'm just honestly hoping because there is a world where you can just pitch that straight to my net but it's pretty unlikely and i mentioned this in a previous video like pretty recently no one's perfect no one's going to be able to do that stuff every single time so you know play what you most likely think will happen don't play the one out of a hundred thing that might happen right [Music] really good pressure again they don't really have any way out right this whole two set of uh games here just a lot of just pressure from us perfect rotations really and hitting the ball around them as much as possible they're really no way to get control of the game but yeah the two games for today hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is for watching this like comment and subscribe to see us all in the next one i love y'all peace you
