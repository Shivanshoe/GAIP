yo what is up guys going to be playing some games today with torment from v1 and gyro who is currently on the peeps so two rlcs pro players and it should be some of the games always get games playing with other pros and yeah it's late night right now we're just vibing we're chilling having a good time i would like to say thank you so much for all the support on the channel guys we're at 850 000 subscribers now just around there so thank you so much for making that even close to a possibility it's actually ridiculous to even think about thank you so so much guys we're only 150 000 away now i know i said only but still a lot still a ways to go but only 150k to go and we're definitely on track to be able to reach it for end of the year but we got to keep hitting that sub button so if you're brand new here and you do enjoy this video and my content in general but you're not subscribed to make sure you do hit that subscribe button i love you all let's get into the games all right we got a sweaty game let's drop the bat here we got a bunch of question marks kinsey and mile all righty i'm dead off the bat take back left boost i'll go for this now should beat that guy nice i'll take the base before i leave here huge speed from gyro good dunk somebody can keep in that's fine i'll go back taking the mid pads here could be rough our bumps that is very unfortunate just my luck to be honest lately having some pretty unlucky things going on yeah absolutely slammed oh good dumb i'm not gonna get unlucky twice like that in one game surely not right surely not like i was if can't kick off and it's working better than if he actually went for the kickoff somehow rocket league is an interesting game it's a very interesting game the only game in the world where you can make mistakes or you can actually do something incorrectly and it'll it'll just work you know it's the only game in the world i swear i don't know what they did there i won't lie to you i was very interesting no clue they just left they're like oh balls in my net all right i'm leaving getting some boost for the kickoff yeah like i was saying only game where like you can completely whiff a ball that you can miss and it'll just work out as a fake and the other team will just get confused because you miss and it's not even going to be better unless it's like a really really bad misinformation but i'm talking about the ones on offense that randomly gets you goals those are the ones that it's just like bro this game is one of a kind like in cs go you can't whiff a one tap and hope to you know survive somehow unless the other team makes a big mistake in return you know what i mean you know what i'm saying if you played other games rocket league's one of a kind there's also no cheaters in this game which is really good the no cheaters thing is is huge i feel like it's really underrated and rockety how crazy that is that we never ever have to worry about a cheater in this game should beat him it's on the wall i gotta be careful here good boom downfield place across driver should shoot if i hit this up close tormach should have actually i'll hit back for him maybe that's fine i didn't take that boost i trust i trust my team i believe in them on defense oh hi gyro we can't stop bumping each other i'm gonna go again i probably shouldn't waste all my boost but this stuck with my gut i figured that was the best play to make there we kill some time for my team jars up quick good speed that's fine actually good for us should mid and he missed it's a goal yeah it was good for us i noticed that that situation was going to be good as soon as he got stuck there and he couldn't follow up again i knew i beat him on the wall the next guy up i had more momentum coming in there i have more boost the other guy's probably hurting on boost so kind of expect to win a challenge like that probably get one more here if i could block them and be big that's good too i'm still trying to force that over to my team no matter what so anyway that gets to them is actually a win in my book i'd say shut up block every angle that isn't going to be directly toward them it's going to bait nice again beat them can we all push that's probably gonna be bad i believe in gyro oh that was a goal if i beat him you have to go back here kind of or get a bad touch forward either it's fine nice all right thomas feeling it i got it double double oh my god i'm some cheeks the bouncer come on for a demo nice good play i should have scored that double like 10 out of 10 times but i just suck right now it happens sometimes you suck you know sometimes you're good sometimes you suck simple as that you have off days i've been having an off like two weeks i don't feel very good but it's okay we'll get out of it just gotta keep playing through it stay strong i'm gonna stay behind me as third man you wanna be a little bit further back you don't wanna be pushing up too far that way i don't have to go back when that gets hit there i just react to it i shouldn't waste it on my boost though it's pretty dumb that's fine so of course the bad touch turmeric should have this kind of dealt with in the corner that's bad actually oh my god how are you surviving they're blocking everything before i had to wait i was trying to do something cheeky and then i missed i was trying to get the flippy set off the back wall nice all right this is the one pass oh that's actually mid let's save i should be game we can get two that quick i'm going off the ceiling the pre-jump of the century oh no nevermind you missed we're good all right good first game let's get into the next one i was sweaty probably be the same dude so maybe another good matchup hopefully i can play a little bit better get some good goals that's the that's the plans let's get into it let's see how it goes all right got ourselves bumping squiggle and 16 all right we'll see what can be done we regain i'm gonna play better this game i'm just gonna challenge full boost yeah this guy's just bumping it's fine though b2 i feel like i'm in a miniature slump that's you know that's when the redemption arc begins when you feel the mini slump coming in it's only up it's a good thing about it if you always play good you know you can never go higher than that but if you suck sometimes you know it's perfect you want to suck let me go back it's good to suck you learn when you suck because i'm trying to say more of the story is you should suck as much as possible this video has been informative one of my most informative videos yet hey squishy how do i improve your rocky just suck more man the more you suck the better you'll get incoming all the comments i already suck but i'm not a pro yet it's like all the time you know what i mean if you have some bad days it's good you'll learn from it it would be nice to just win everything all the time always never have to worry about losing anything but you know that's not how it be i'm not gonna go for that it's ready up gyro is a good ball here i should get past i don't know if you wanted to be that weak but it's really good see i can do here off wall should do something different with that no one's ever really close for those anymore seems like to me ducking him oh would have been the play if he just banged it into me for whatever reason nice left wall honestly better than taking a shot there i was gonna be weak probably not on target either not a terrible idea it's fun nothing too dangerous just waiting to cross bang good shot that was a good play try to just dribble this again couldn't because he went for the challenge so i had to kind of also challenge we're also just going to get destroyed to that ball i want to dribble with the wall though to make a play like it's better to control those in the corner fast back oh this is huge i'm going to square off this i can smell it i shouldn't let him have that okay we're scoring 134 left on the clock we're scoring calling it calling it oh here it is nevermind never mind it would have been epic though had that pass been perfect and then it goes off back wall and someone comes in scores it was all lining up the stars were aligning want a little more boost nice well done well done all right here games hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all and yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video peace you
