far we're up to 800 000 subscribers now which is just not to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoyed today's video love y'all yo what's up guys so i told you guys i'd make a video on this not too long ago and here it is so this is the training pack i made and each shot you can kind of do different things with it but so i'll pretty much go through each shot and i'll just tell you guys what i think you should try to work on or um you know just go for if you're brand new for the first time this is a good one to practice air dribbles and obviously you're not gonna be able to do it perfectly every single time but it's a good one to kind of get understanding of how you should do it and uh you know slow down your first touch off the wall and just try to get around it that's the main thing you should be practicing is over and over again just the beginning part slow it down and try to get like good control on the ball you don't need to go all the way i just want to show you guys the beginning because that's the most important part of an air dribble if you can get a good first touch you can stay with the ball all the way all the way downfield doesn't even matter so practice getting a slow light first touch like this and trying to stay as long as possible and then once you get you know more consistently more comfortable with that you can practice pre-flipping into it and trying to get doubles off of it and stuff like that so that's the main thing i would like to use this first one for if i was a newer player um and then once you get better and better like i said go for the double taps go for the pre-flips the um air dribbles into the pre-flips to double tap stuff like that like that's really good in comp because you're gonna have that flip that throws them off and gets it over that second player that challenges you so that's a really good thing to to practice and then it also helps you practice your double taps which i think is a really good shot to um you know try to perfect as well and uh yeah that's pretty much the whole first shot this whole idea of the first shot you can even go off the ceiling if you want to though you have a lot of options with this you're not really stuck with one thing you can do a lot of different attempts you can go for like a weird like ceiling shot musty or something something weird i don't know whatever you want you have a lot of freedom with the shot and that's the whole idea of this pack is to have a lot of freedom in different scenarios and trying different things i made this one the first because a lot of things you can practice off of it so you can just load up the pack and you're immediately here the whole idea of it triple reset into the next shot it looked okay i think we got a little bit too low to the ground but it was still a good triple reset but there go you can practice your double triple flipper sets as well off this so it's a really good first shot on to the next this one the whole idea of this there's only really one way that you can do this and the way it was intended to be done is you just wait for the bounce off the wall and you go for a double tap it's a regular old double tap off the backboard and that's a really good thing to practice in game because if you have a lot of pressure they're panicking they're clearing it off their own wall you could just go for a double and practice reading in different ways that's a really good shot to practice not much else to it but that's something that happens a lot in game being able to do those consistently is really useful all right so for this one just another double tap but this is a really big one that you should try to practice is a redirect into a double tap so it's awkward because the ball is coming from behind you and in the game this is a really good one to go fast to because normally someone's going to be challenging this so you have to beat one person and then try to get a shot in not to make this shot very difficult because you got to go fast at a first hit and then you got to get a really good shot to follow placement if you're in a high level lobby because most people will save that kind of shot right there most people will save it if it was in so you got to try to practice getting a fast shot of it like that this is a really good one to practice and if you're lower rank you know try to take a little bit slower maybe don't go as quick to it and just get more comfortable just hitting the ball you can even go for like a up redirect on these if you want to if you're lower rank just like that it doesn't have to be anything crazy but just try to get it on goal and practice getting comfortable and navigating your car around the ball to hit the ball where you want it to be all right this one this is a pretty common reading game this is a really big one to practice i like to just float for these in game because most of the time you have a lot more time to react to what's going to happen and that that would actually be a really sick goal holy dude what what did i just do that would be a sick goal in game i floated got a double hit it up landed on the back wall jumped off and then back flipped it in so yeah this one i like to just float that's that's the whole idea of it you want to just float and just go for the read doesn't have to be perfect every single time but this is one that end game if you can read it it's huge and if you're up early for this you're going to beat the opponent to it which is uh another plus so the whole idea of that is read it off the wall try to float to it try to get comfortable at getting those wall reads as quick as possible because you have to beat people to the ball in a situation like that so try to get as comfortable as possible but that's pretty much that one all right this was just to practice air dribbles looks pretty basic and it is basic but it's something that will help you hugely mechanically i think you have a lot of time on the ball here you hit it up get comfortable getting touches on it and you have just a lot of space in general obviously from one side of the boat to the other so you can get really good at your control and going for just weird stuff in general and just trying to make it you know as interesting as possible in terms of your learning experience because you have a lot of options with this shot which is what i love about it so yeah this is pretty much the idea this one just keep going for air dribbles double taps flip resets stuff like that i had to go for air double dub steps a lot on these just because that's a situation that pops up a lot in game that's something i like to try to do a lot but in general it's just good to practice your your aerial control with the ball and just getting good air dribbling in general so that's a really good one to practice and uh no matter what rank you are you know you can somewhat get better at car control using this shot so this one there's a few ways you can use this one i originally put this one here to practice pinching which i'm not gonna get every time i'll show you guys how long it'll take me to get this because i'm not even good at these myself honestly i never really try them but that was almost perfect almost top corner but you can get a pinch that goes in from here and that was actually the idea why i put this here to practice this because there are a few occasions where that could actually get you a goal if you're low boost and you're kind of just rushing to play that's almost top corner as well but um that's the whole idea of this shot that's what it was at first if you're lower rank obviously it's gonna be really weird for you because you probably don't know about pinching yet or like how pitching works uh almost in i want to get one check to show you guys what i mean but what i want to show you guys is that you can do a lot with this shot outside of just pinching this is a fun thing to practice for me especially because it's not something that i get to do very often or even try to do so that's an example of what it would look like one of those pinches but you can get it higher like you almost saw me get it in like three or four times higher up but what you could do if you're not going for a pinch is just go for an air dribble and uh you know again be creative doesn't have to be just a normal air dribble you can be creative with it and do something weird i like to go for double flippy said sometimes off these just it just makes it fun i don't know you have a lot of a lot of options and i think that's why i wanted to make this pack so bad because there aren't any main packs that you have many options for shots kind of like a set in stone thing you have to just do it but for this pack every single shot has multiple options so i love about it so yeah you can go for air dribble flip reset double flip reset whatever you want you have a lot of options with this and go for the pinch going to go for a ceiling shot off of this take your time practice as if you're in a game stuff like that so a lot of options ceiling shot air dribble pinch all that good stuff you practice all that all right this one again you're the same options as the last and go for a pinch which i got first try that's actually my first try you can go for a pinch an air dribble ceiling shot the exact same stuff as the previous you have a lot of options and the ball is just in a different position so yeah just try to practice as many possible things as you can and uh make it as good for yourself as possible don't do anything too easy you know try to make it as difficult as possible as advanced as possible try to push your your skill ceiling a little bit higher then always go for the same stuff over and over again i always try to you know learn new things when you get on every single day don't waste any time if you're trying to get better try to realize what you can do to improve but yeah this is a good shot really good shot to practice uh air dribbles pre-flips into air dribbles ceiling shots you know whatever you want to try you have a lot of freedom with this shot it's a really good one to practice pinches as well all right so this one's just a catch into a pre-flip air dribble across the map that's the whole point of this one that's the whole thing we're trying to practice if you're a high level player because that's huge in high level competitive lobbies because you really need to have this skill on defense you can get past multiple people and you kill a lot of time for your teammates to get boost so pretty much we want to do is just take a touch up the wall get one or two and then just keep going that's the whole idea whole idea of this shot pretty much and my air dribble into pre-flip there could have been a lot better but you just want to get as many touches as possible going down the field and just practice whatever you possibly can so i'll show you one more example hopefully i'll do better better example hopefully it's a little touch up there there we go that's a perfect example of what i'm talking about you touch up the wall to control pre-flip out into an air dribble at that point probably over one or two people and then i wouldn't have that much boost to go for a double but that's just something that i like to do in the training pack so for this shot this is like the only shot on the whole thing the whole idea of it is just to do one thing and that's a corner double tap which is a very hard thing to do and it's gonna be one that probably only high level players can do but this is just what it would look like i might mess it up i probably will but this is my first attempt at it and i'll just try it until i get it in so you guys see how long it takes me but it's supposed to be a corner double tap and these are really good in high level play because people normally expect you to hit it out the back wall hanging out the corner is just the perfect thing to do because normally people aren't just camping corner if you hit it fast enough they're not going to be there so this is an example so i missed that one but i'll try to get one more that's an example of it i can do a lot better in terms of power and height and stuff like that but that's just an example that's my second try and i got it but that's the whole idea of this shot i want to get a good one there so you guys can see how nice these look i want to get like a really fast one it's hard to get like the perfect touch in this though in game i don't know if i if you hit the perfect one of these it would look so nice that was really good top corner yeah these look so so nice i've hit a couple of them in game and it's like it's up there for me that's like top three shot if you get this in a big match top three best shots to hit i feel like something about they're just so clean that's really nice that's the whole idea of it though hit off that right corner and go for a double all right so for this one just an air drill where you're close to the ball again really good for your double practice on your setups so just keep on practicing your your first jump if you're new to air dribble it's a huge thing to practice obviously you want to use arrow right so it'd probably just be like this i'm just like that's fine that's that's probably what your idols look like if you're a lower ranked player and that's something that you should practice for sure over and over again just get that first touch and just stay on the ball that's all you gotta do is try to stay on the ball as long as possible but the first touch is the most important part you want to have the ball stay right there i'm going to stay with the whole way but yeah once you get arrow right involved that makes the whole controlling it much easier because you have a lot more options it feels like it writes a huge thing to implement to your game yeah you can go for ceiling shot off this too there's really no specific thing you have to do off this shot you need to go for double or triple reset which i messed up but you have a lot of options all the ones that go up the wall like that you have a lot of options and that's the the beauty about it you want to have those options in your arsenal to be able to use them that way when the ball is running with the wall your opponent won't know if you're going to go for you know one of like five things i don't know which one you're going to go for that's the whole idea of it just the power shot really nothing too special but it's something that every player should know how to do consistently and uh you know practicing getting the perfect timing for like maximum power on shots is a huge huge thing so yeah definitely something you should practice is a shot that i would spend like 10 to 15 minutes on every day if you're playing this pack because it's a really fun one you can get really good at timing your hits and making sure it's under the crossbar there's a couple things you can do if you are a lower ranked player i don't think you're gonna be able to do the off the backboard redirect so what i would recommend is just wait for the ball as if it's in a game try to get around it and just take a shot and that seems really simple but if you're lower rank this happens in key more than you think or it's an empty name you have to turn around it so it's a good thing to practice but outside of that if you're a high level player you should practice a back wall redirect this whole idea this so here's an example of what that would look like i just did it but here's another one where i use my flip properly so yeah that's the whole idea of this shot pretty much the back wall redirect you go to the wall as fast as possible you're trying to act like you're beating a defender to it try to imagine an invisible defender there this one is all about speed you want to get to the ball as quick as possible and go for a double tap off of it or just go for a shot it doesn't have to be anything too crazy but you want to act like there's a defender up that you're beating to the ball that's the whole idea this one though is going to the ball as fast as you can and trying to get a good double touch off of it or just a shot off of it try to go as fast as possible it's just to practice your speed and your fast aerial mechanics that's the whole idea of it so if you're lower rank practice your fast aerials on this one it's a really good one to practice this is actually probably one of the most difficult shots in the pack if you're not comfortable with doing a forward cancelled flip to make sure you're going as fast as possible with your flip and it's kind of confusing i don't really know how to explain how to do it it's just like the opposite of a half flip but if you don't do that specific flip you pretty much can't reach this and it's just the practice being as fast as possible with your flip and boost so i'll show you guys an example if i do a normal um boost front flip combo you want to actually reach underneath the ball on time if i boost all the way if you want to reach it if i do a side flip combo i won't reach in time there's no real way to actually reach it without doing what i'm about to show you no matter what you do really you can hit the ball maybe but you won't ever be able to catch it so i'll show you guys the only way you could possibly do this is by doing the perfect cancelled four diagonal flip while boosting the entire time and you have to catch it and then you just gotta score just finish it off all you gotta do this is what it should look like if you do a perk so that's as fast you could possibly go on that flip to catch it and there's no other flip that'll actually reach underneath the ball on time you guys can try it for yourself like i said i'll link the pack down below let me know if you can do this shot without the cancel flip i don't think it's possible i tested it quite a bit but i was making it so that's a really good one to practice your your flips making sure you're as fast as possible on them um for this last shot pretty much you're supposed to replicate if a teammate passes from the right side like this high up middle i'm gonna go for a double tap off this i like to go for a flipper set double tap just to practice and make it weirder but yeah this is just an example there we go that's pretty much the whole pack the whole idea of every shot pretty much went through everything and i hope you guys enjoy using this pack yourself i think it's gonna be a lot of help for a lot of you guys especially if you're still practicing your mechanics and you're very new to practicing certain mechanics gonna help you out massively um even me practicing this now i feel like it helps me with certain things like getting better at certain things so definitely keep practicing guys over and over again and you'll you'll see a lot of improvements i promise this pack will help you a lot so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed the video have yourself a wonderful day or night with the timers when you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
