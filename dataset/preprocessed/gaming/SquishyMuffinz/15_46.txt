yo what's up guys so i have a crazy story for you guys so this past rlcs regional this weekend we ended up making the grand finals yet again but there is a lot of crazy circumstances going into this so i ended up going to the tournament feeling extremely ill i was actually planning on potentially not even playing because of how sick i felt before the tournament and ended up just sucking it up trying to just play through it and uh ended up working out pretty well for us we made it all the way to the grand finals beating g2 in the first set and then losing in the second um but either way extremely extremely good tournament from us based on what happened garrett woke up on championship sunday um he had prosciutto the night before and apparently made him have an upset stomach so he was kind of just pooping his brains out the whole day was not feeling good by any means and uh he was actually considering not even playing as well on the championship sunday um so we decided to just play through all of our issues everything we ended up losing to g2 straight away on the day which i knew would happen i honestly thought we're going to lose 40 twice because of the situation going into this um so we lost 400 gt which i expected because you know we were not anywhere near 100 at all and then going into the lower final we're down 03 in the lower final and uh it's the best of seven so you have to lose four games obviously and we ended up just saying you know who cares let's just have fun let's just see what happens and uh we ended up fighting our way back from o3 to 3-3 and this right here what i'm about to show you is the game seven and uh this was the craziest game of my entire career i think the craziest series just everything that happened it was insane the ending you can't ask for a better ending to a situation like this um so this is the second time we're playing phase second time we beat them we're two for two against them um obviously they're a good team they have solid players uh it's always gonna be a good match against them but take a look at this game seven i thought the craziest of game sevens but the ending is the best thing i've ever seen in in a situation like this it's not even close i've never seen anything like this so let's get started i'll just watch my pv i might switch through throughout it i don't remember what happened but it's actually good cheat really good start to the game actually usually this situation i don't want to pause that much but usually the situation is a very difficult one for the last man but i did a good job to cheat here so ages 2 was actually pretty bad he didn't react in time and he cheated a little bit too close so that's not what you want to do you want to try to stay a little further back and be able to react to the left or the right so he did a kind of poor cheat there left first in a really bad spot and uh i played it well i went around the bump from aj and then i actually have a shooting opportunity here and first honestly at this point it looks like it's gonna be a goal but it's even with a really good shot for me first turned really quick and did a good job really good bump for me off the bat nice that's a huge start and a game seven like this and we just won three in a row massive start so my pov as soon as i get that shot i go for a bump on first i don't want to control this i don't want to get a play going forward it actually probably should have been a demo i'm not gonna lie but it's fine it works out and now ada is in a bad spot justin goes for a bump on him and garrett has a free shot so that's a really good start starting off a game seven eight seconds in with one goal is absolutely massive and if you're a good team like us and you're very experienced very solid you're not gonna make a mistake that's gonna cost you that goal very easily it's going to be very hard for them to get that goal back let's see what happens good control touch from justin playing patiently here trying to reach this back well actually really good job to reach that look tough take the mid boost here plays it left try to play it right to justin justin fakes the shot which is smart i waited middle just in case he wanted to use me but it's off the back wall now i don't want to go for a shot hopefully shot here is useless all i could do here i have three options pretty much with the amount of speed the angle i'm coming in on this and the time i have um so i know you just flip it toward that any shot on goal is not going to work hits at a corner would have probably worked gears probably okay alright my gear it's not really a good spot slipping back so i probably got the calm that no one's mid for me i'm pretty sure that's what happened and then my my situation there is i no longer should pass this because if i hit this off the wall aj can now just go to the ground free or dribble now it's a race very bad situation for for garrett um so best case scenario here is just try to make a pressure touch make it go back well i can't go for a shot a shot here gonna be around here it's gonna be lower the ball is gonna have a better chance to roll up this wall and be fully controlled but instead a little bit harder to control and justin can actually win the next touch but he misses which is unfortunate but it's not a big deal at all and now that they have an air dribble touchdown i was talking about off of just a miss it's a good try from them in that play only bad thing about this play from phase and something they do a little bit a little bit too often probably is they sent two on this which is pretty useless um now they have two on the back wall and aj's third band for probably like five seconds at least let's see see if i'm right one two three four five yeah have people like around like the i would say until a third until someone can successfully like reset the here then you're like in a safe position they didn't have someone like reset to around here for about four seconds that's all because of that as soon as someone's around here you're good this guy can cover everything but if he's still rotating back here and we have a counter opportunity this is going to be a goal every time so that's good ended up working out not too bad for them but still a bad play on their part don't want to commit two like that really good demo good touch as well and i could just leave now and have to do anything else actually a very good play put it around first and spot that you can't really react i can't do anything else about that i was gonna go again buddy up bomb so i just ended up backflipping out of it again sip is actually in my opinion playing a little bit poor here it's going for a lot of stuff like this that's just never going to be a goal this is this is never going to become a goal i think you should know that and especially with this boost level you're just going gonna end up on our back wall for a while now i'm not helping his team so a little bit of a mistake there but it's okay commitment problems like what they're committing for isn't great this would have been so unlucky by the way they gotta go out of this i'm gonna save from gary by the way typical oh my god all right i feel bad it's like a typical roast session but i i didn't realize oh my gosh first should be scoring this 10 out of 10 times by the way this is okay i'll be honest this is very lucky this whole situation is extremely lucky of them the fact that this goes straight into them is just boosting away extremely lucky but first 10 out of 10 times should be scoring this there is there is no excuse to miss this to be honest and then sip i don't i don't even want to get started on this one you have all of the left side of the right side than that but that's painful to watch but it's all right we'll take it they're gonna go for sure i did not realize that they made those mistakes tilting game for sure then actually really good dunk for me could have been a goal huge huge 50. if garrett's closer the thing is look at your hpv probably looks like i'm getting beat and garrett's last back here so garrett can't actually push up for this ball even though it looks troll that nobody's there after he can't push up for this ball cause if if i get beat which at this point it looks like i'm getting a heartbeat to this ball i can't beat that it's terrible but it's almost a straight and it would have been really good back to my pov here i'm back with full boost good touches from justin i think i got scared off by sip the sip was like going for me here i thought i was in here for me again then i went a little bit too quick because i heard him dirt for me one more time but either way it's not a big deal still get the ball out of it actually a really good touch something like very small there but in the middle of the field getting the weight of something like that it's huge very important another big miss from first good booming clear from justin is there very important in those situations where like everyone needs boost actually a good read from sip i think i could undifferent here if i'm like really like being nitpicky with this and like trying to be super critical or just hit it around on to the right hit it right corner the only thing that's bad about this um is that aj gets a free dribble and it's probably not a good thing uh because justin's still rotating back so i think it's actually not bad because this usually will go back to garrett if i lose this challenge and this is the way i think about things if i lose this challenge in any way as long as i know i have a third man behind me it literally doesn't matter at all this will probably go to my teammate gary was a little bit too pushed out but he still wins the next ball like i had imagined that's fine as well this might look this might look bad like from this perspective but this is actually very good for me none of my teammates can challenge this and this literally just forces him to not be able to shoot the ball you look at his pov i have the whole net blocked pretty much you can't shoot this off of me literally just jumping for this look how much of the net is blocked and gary has the other side if it's like around me everything is going to be blocked and forces him to go toward the wall there which gives my team the ball it's actually a good thing to have someone just jump like i'd want someone up for this right now and geared yeah just just went for it for me it's perfect again justin just going very good this is a situation that's very bad this is like the worst thing that can happen when you have two players in the same corner like this and this guy is waiting for this guy to challenge because almost all the time no matter what this challenge ends up being there's not going to be a potential follow-up um and first it's always gonna go for a low 50 here which is pretty obvious but it's just i don't know it's very hard for this guy to help out when a rotation breaks down like this and justin's this far out it's just because they've had pressure for an extended amount of time it's just gonna be a very difficult situation so go for the block and again the low 50 garrett kind of has to go with me and then it's too late but first played it well as well it's a good play for him essentially this is a 1v1 though at this point and yeah essentially yes it's just a 1v1 and it ends up going straight in off the 50 but gear ends up blocking it which is good positioning from him but then he can't fall off the next either way that's more down to like not not really being able to help each other on the challenge like you want someone to be able to go way earlier and that's why i think once is a bad game mode by the way because it's a lot of like you have two good players almost every single time it's going to be a goal on a 1v1 you don't have anyone to challenge for you there's no sense of teamwork so i think the whole idea of 1v1 doesn't really show your skill all that well in my opinion because every every good player should be able to score a one-month scenario every time doesn't necessarily make someone stand out in my opinion i think what makes them stand out is they're able to like utilize a team to challenge properly and stuff like that why did jess's name change to ok alligator 331 i don't know but it's fine that's actually a very difficult skill to learn something that a lot of very good players don't even know how to do just to use their teammates to challenge properly with them it's a very very good pass good shot from garrett good job let's see the situation aj is hitting it downfield justin pops it for me i call i'm going for two and i'm gonna pass mid so i'm calling already right here that i'm gonna pass this mid so watch get instantly start turning middle because i already called this way early and you can just shoot it so communication is very important and and having good mechanics obviously like i trust myself in a situation to get these touches every time as soon as justin pops i'm calling what i'm doing right here or before i even make contact on the ball so this is like you have to have a lot of trust in yourself you have a lot of trust in your team and you have to understand the situation very well like i know just gonna be back regardless here just as soon as he lands i know he's gonna go back i think at least let's see yeah he's gonna chill back here behind us that gives us that extra sense of like comfortability i know if two of us are gonna commit for this play we already know two are committed for that play as soon as they jump two of us gonna commit we know he's back and look how justin's reading this by the way again a little minor detail he's getting shot to the left side he's already he knows his ball is going from right to left look at look at the line of the ball the trail from right to left he knows no matter what happens here if they get the same on this ball it's going left he's going to be the first one there look how he starts moving toward that that's like a very small detail that just shows like how good players are just reading the game and how fast they are to be ahead of the game and like trying to read the the future of where they should be a very good play here it touches and it's a really good way to get around the the defense look at their perspective like you literally can't do a thing about it it's too fast for him to reach at this point man 37 left the whole goal is to not make any mistakes you just don't make a mistake you'll win the game again great challenge perfect challenge it really doesn't matter this ball gets past me i do my job perfectly here i know jess can be behind me i said i'm just going to go if i if i don't go for this this is going to be a pass to sip that's super close to the ground you can have a lot of power in the shot challenge right away sip can't tell if i'm winning this so he has to respect it zip's gonna start turning away from that and that's that's gonna give my team a chance to actually get it clear on that pass from justin challenge i'm just gonna go again doesn't really matter as long as i force the touch early i don't want to have someone air dripping toward my net with full boost without being interrupted at all here i take mid so i gotta rotate back it's fine missed the boost a little bit time happens a lot of trust in justin there to win that challenge look at the little touches like this actually does so much it's actually insane how much this touch does it looks so it looks so little and like so not important but he can't do anything with his ball look what look what his touch does just the ceiling touch and just gonna win it every time you literally can't do a thing with that ball any anytime you'll have that that's a good touch let's say from justin see what he does how justin reads this it's a really good save actually could pass off the corner from first first is a very very good passer something that he's very underrated for i think he's much better at passing than both of his teammates are and that's like where the biggest threat is on this team is the fact that first actually is a very good passer that's like the biggest threat of this this squad in my opinion that's a very good save from justin there all right pay close attention to the end of this game guys the very very end of this game it's the craziest thing also on no boost by the way no boost for a while here we're just trying to get in the way this play doesn't matter what we do but we got two of them out of the play with zero boost three of them actually because first is dope on that so i more than did my job there got their whole team to commit for no resources pretty much and my team was able to get boosts throughout all that staying behind garrett if he gets beat huge to help him out there and again i don't have to do anything else just rotate back 20 seconds left now very very terrifying situation but i played this very well at 50 happens aj goes i'm bumping and bumping i bait that i'm gonna go fast forward the ball and i tell justin to try to help me out the sip's going to slow down for the bump and i know that so if i tell justin to help me it's going to give time for me to actually be able to avoid the bump and it just flips right over me very good patience again in the back wall 12 seconds left at this point one mistake it still crosses the game so get control from justin nice 50. this is where it gets spooky and bump shut up challenges actually really good beat from sip all the way back here so i like to be in this position i feel comfortable this is where it gets spooky i this is like the worst thing that can happen on zero seconds the ball goes straight up and just dies on someone's car and it's the other team's car if it's your car perfect you can just kill it you can just let it hit the ground lands perfectly on their car off the gear at 50 here and now my situation this is the hardest hardest position to be in as a defender here because you can make or break this play i am second man here so i know justin's behind me let's take a look where justin's at so dustin is gonna wait for me to challenge this but here's the problem first full control this ball if there's a there's a few scenarios here if i full speed challenge this first most likely will either flick me as he sees me going or i'm gonna just look stupid try to read the the flick and go over the ball he's going to fake me and have full control either way first is good enough in a 1v1 scenario with this much time gear cannot help us at all gear it is essentially out of the play is it 2v1 2v3 actually scenario so garrett could not help us in this situation literally there's no help at all this is all on me to make a good challenge and it's so difficult for me to do that in this situation because he has a typical option to the right this is what makes this difficult he has this option and i know that so i have to play it safe and i did look how much i slowed down here this is actually a very smart play the problem is justin creeps up in about the same position as me so i creep up and i end up getting flat-footed and first actually flicks is at the perfect time where he notices i've stopped moving and i can't get this ball now it's over me at this point it's not in my hands anymore i've done all i can do i force him to go left at least and that's that's my whole job there is to force him to do something other than shoot the ball but this typical option made things difficult i knew it would so he has that option and that's what he did he ended up hitting it right here on our screens because there is a little bit of lag it ended up showing that the ball was like 99 on our screen because there's like a little bit of lag on servers but my perspective that whole play is what it looked like i slowed down well it's actually very smart so much dribbling slowing down like this is good matching their speed it's good you can bait the flick and get them to flick it early first killer again i think he's the best player on this team i think he uses his teammates the best does a very good job he flicks it to his teammate which is something i don't think either of his other teammates would have done in this scenario and sip gets a shot out of it and sip honestly could have scored a lot of time this game that's the one he has to put home he does not but it is okay it was uh a great moment for everyone to watch the reverse sweep best of seven reverse three ever best seven reverse trip that happened in n a r l c s and uh yeah the first one to ever happen happened the day before this so two happened back to back and this one was against faze so that's a very interesting series of events i want to see typical pov here what he what do you thought or why he missed this yeah i don't know that's pretty bad i feel like i feel like he has to save his flip here justin they're they're i don't think there's any world where justin's up for this quick enough to react to the fact that this is over me uh it's just way too hard to react to fact this is over me if sip just saves this flip here this is a goal 10 out of 10 times there's almost nothing that can be done justin i will say justin played this perfectly though on defense at this point outside of the fact that he pushed up a little bit close to me but it's also my fault in a way because i should have just full rush but there is a chance that i leave him in an even worse situation than this this this situation is so bad it's honestly super unlucky the way it unfolded i'm not gonna lie but look how he covers like so much of the high here and he makes it so that if this ball is going in it has to go beneath him like there's no way it can go in but beneath him and that means that it's going to be dead so he essentially saved everything he had to save on the goal line so that's really well done technically it is the same from justin you played it very well but yeah mostly just a really bad shot from sip off of a very good pass from first so it's honestly like just it was meant to be we're meant to win this series we're meant to win this game and uh yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time this when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and see us on the next you
