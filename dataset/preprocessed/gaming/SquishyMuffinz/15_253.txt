a hundred thousand subscribers now which is just nuts to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo what is up guys give me running some well going games for today should be some sweaty ones because we're getting pretty high of Amar I think we're really close to top hundred again so let's get straight into it see we can get some dubs let's see how it goes I'm the first game I played against Grande I played this guy before he plays quite a bit of one so it's gonna be a tough one you always gives me a close match so we'll see how it goes but be a good start if you get the kickoff goal I think we did here we go well because I lowered my my game audio quite a bit she has might not be able to hear it as much as before but it's meant to be that way I'm just not playing with high game on yeah anymore because a lot as it was at least if you guys want it to be louder again I can try to raise it just what felt best to me recently playing over Laurie lauraaradi oh you got that booster kind of sucks but should be able to score stuff so all the goals in this game stuff were pretty much been off kick off his goal wasn't directly off it neither was mine my second one but if you win kick off and you can get the next video off of it it's pretty much I'd counter to kick off cool I've kind of started like once a little bit more lately I'm in-between about them I can't tell if I like them again low honey moon phases with them or I think I like them and then I don't again trying to control this just stay away I think gonna go away maybe back off let's get of him he's gonna have that I'm gonna bother and get the boost instead that's fine what good is boost against perfect it's gonna be a low now trying to play as passive as possible but I had all his boosts and knew that so I didn't really need a panic too much I was trying to hold him in spots where he couldn't get a shot no doubt of my mind though you can definitely come back from this this is not a big lead by any means in one's slippery sit yes terrible idea by dribble that ball I have a much higher chance in ago if she missed somehow I don't know how but you did Finch oh try for the graphene I don't think you expect me to go so I'll just go I'm playing a little bit stupid but it's kind of working just can't complain you definitely should have scored the empty net happens a Bampton it doesn't look so empty sometimes you know I've all-time scoring empty net say I do and like there's three people in that sometimes it's impossible to say if you had the the perfect setup and he did can't do much about that you got to hope and pray at that point thank you guys been working well Oh moreover I wanted him to think that I was gonna go for the air dribble bump and then just get an extra hard touch what's he waited a little bit too long to challenge me gotta save my boost here that's fine I still have a good amount of boost so I think he'll go for the shot shoot away and try to just block him by driving into this it's a little bit awkward Oh snag the Beast perfect something he won't expect me probably oh he did actually was ready for that that's really good of him in my head I thought he was gonna dribble like just flow with the ball and try to dribble I don't need to be aggressing for that obviously but end of the day it's a ranking you know what do you really lose if you lose you know what I mean it's okay to take those those risks sometimes tell you to sit aside I'll see a quick why not oh I missed no no what have I done all right I'm not gonna go for a super risky stuff anymore I don't want to throw knowing me I'm gonna go for a risky thing and the very next touch I get 100% oh I was unlucky I was honestly really unlucky one idea are you messed up you just messed up his aerial and then tried to go back and hate him happens I'd rather just be closer in a blow anyway he's going up it's fun forget the beasts you probably get to go out of this here we go I won't throw anymore let's get tangles that's the goal here two minutes to get three goals here do it we'll do a ball we have time on the ball is in your back there we go my old strats 2016 bounce troubles coming in clutch what can we do with this this is risky because he's been saving them every time I'll plate to my corner sorry I stole possession he has to kind of back off here there we go that's really tough because he kind of has to challenge me there like he doesn't have much of a choice because if he waits I dribble I be free dribble so yes it's try to pressure me but I'm having a good 50 on that every time all right good first game though it was definitely slowly one I expect it to be a sweaty one but I was making some stupid mistakes to be fair and all those girls could have probably been avoided but that's tell me how once goes the goals are definitely avoided almost all the time so let's get through next one though seep and get the back to back see how it goes alright flash team I can't believe we're actually ready to must see what the heck I even know the man played once alright pressures on me here must he's got muscles you got no pressure this matchup he's expected expected to lose probably my most people so it's on me most he's not better at all by any means he's definitely got potential to be you need to be really good I think he's just got super solid mechanics has to work on just his game sense in general like you'll see the mechanics are good it's mechanical definitely solid which is pretty much all you need for a once honestly you don't need to know how to play around around anyone really you're fifty there we go good pressure I also recently added mostly on Steam so we could probably run some two games for a video here there as well miss the boost CBO Freegal surprises this high up and the ones already let me just make sure it's him it is him all right check out the doink make it awkward for him my first touch out here I like try to suffocate in ones I've always had that place stuff oh I can't believe I missed that power shot tried so hard to place it play from him and take the beach there there we go took our time at the pad shot in the bottom corner again I have full faith he come back in this in this matchup so especially cuz I once I once game slightly I've been not as good as I would like to be trying to get back into him I've been a lot more focus on on Three's lately for that high get the boost my fake come there we go I find that that was a harder thing when you're playing someone who's good but not on the level of considered Pro yet when they're playing against a pro it's like they're expected to lose I feel like the pressure is all on the pro it's a pro has to wait or else they're just gonna get like meme dawn I guess best way they explain it like I'm streaming especially it happens a lot whenever I lose it's like whoa you lost cuz I don't lose very often everyone's like whoa I'll wait for possession here stop laying battered although I have a lot of space here try to fake him try make it as awkward as possible for him but it will actually he didn't give too baited anybody what I did probably gonna be able for them yeah the demos and ones are so good so so good you open up so much space I'm gonna fake this one again let them touch that do you think I have a little bit abuse here probably plus I almost got the one spot they'll get me a gold a I'm gonna do anything to save that unfortunately I shouldn't have even went for the shop probably probably been better just hit to the corner moving best bet they I think kind of wait here I'm missing the beach bet on kickoff right now so he kind of has all the advantage I for control here now ah should have waited on my flick the bouncer there we go good old bounce shot never fails those to be so good I've ever I used to do them a lot when I had time to all I do them anymore but this would be a really good shot to do I want to get the 10 man come on little guy ended too early I didn't have the chance to might actually have the chance to this time give me ten three more it's down gonna go for that it's fine there try to surround them yeah so I should've done at one time just play it back because it gives him like way less opportunities to do anything although he still can obviously he's much less of a chance - this is awkward yeah other than a bad spot how good though I'll just be stuffed tell one's go sometimes you really can't do anything about some situations it's really not he's not falling for any of the fakes I've done him every time to be fair but it must be lucky alright no more messing around here I don't want to throw should be fun my opinion there we go I still want the 10 I still want the 10 I got 20 seconds very doable it's probably gonna be me as well which is fun I could have scored I'm sorry I'm such a threes mindset did they I'm hitting off the back wall there's someone no one's obviously gonna be there just ones one more doable doable three seconds there's only one hahaha didn't even give me the chance man all right she must even capably right into it what's so funny I'm gonna get some to his games in with them whenever I see him on I'll try to shoot me an invite we'll get some games young and yes good game though get two games for today I definitely play better in that one but he played super solid you gotta give him credit you tell he's improving he's super solid mechanically and once is really good way to improve I'm sure he's trying to use him for that yeah like I said I'll be guys injoyed have yourself on a full day or night with the timers and room washing is like comment subscribe to see as all in the next one I love y'all peace [Music] you
