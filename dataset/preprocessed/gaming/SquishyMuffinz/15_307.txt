a champion 1 division 2 we can't stop losing god these games are so difficult but hopefully because we've been losing a lot more will be getting the players that are better higher MMR players we've been getting the Lord more players I'm out and I've been on a losing streak I lost two in that last video and I still be getting below everywhere players in the lobby so hopefully we get the players are however more it could be bang some shots for us I really do hope that's the case all right we got one of the dudes that's been winning and merciless Tiger who we haven't seen yet so I really really hope this works out this game we need to win say we desperately need this man I think I'll be breaking the champ - it'll get a lot easier from there to be honest living more consistency and we were playing with but I don't know I'm fully honest yeah I just don't know all that my team in oh okay he's gonna lead for me it's fun oh I can't wait to do try hard series man it's gonna be all my frustration from this year though I thought even fresh should have my team is just the fact that I can't score is the most frustrating thing like just being presented with a shot that I know a score like ten ten times I just can't it's just the most annoying thing just shot that for my teammate well done that's not even happy to play against the last three games some reason for him to shoot hit the side chill back here I'll be have the lead now never last came last video one of the games we won we had to get nine or eight saves or something like that to even have a chance at winning it and I can't shoot so I gotta put in a spot that's at least somewhat suitable for them it's so difficult to tell my brain not today at that shot get it around them well you know a lot of you guys that made entertain me you get from the series just watching me suffer in comments what I see may be right there for my teammate good try I'll leave it for my teammate is well he has a dribble you I could sell by way he's gonna the ball and try control that ball okay that's fine we double commit but better tape and sorry in a situation like that and so low standard I think it's gonna be going in put it off the down bounce get lost back here I believe in them job another home ball hit off the backward you may close and making that reads though they're playing wall on defense for sure the other team b1 b2 teammates let's go to big balls challenge huge balls let's go to up come on we're not losing the same brothers in this game we don't lose these we lost some last game but we all lose in this game nice to touch you have just enough of a touch domestic law need these months today man I'm going full sweating man oh my big demos I like I like how he's thinking the challenge oh my god hopefully we given this in our team I think we had him on our very first game that he played where I asked people to join but we lost it nicely okay my teammates are actually good this game I got actually hit like hitting every single ball they can like all the the major balls I need to be hit they're there for nice I should beat him to that audio vacuum all right I was like impossible to read Olli that's rounded one sorry brother I was good for my teammate I was gonna hit it to him but when I saw him going and decided to leave it how many not died I'm like 99% sure I was going full speed there I'm not sure if I lost right before I hit him I'll go first on this ball he's got challenges early no let him have anything to up so I got a head back that's kind of a dangerous boxy they get a boom and clear back here gonna be my ball he's like it would happen I can't believe we lost that other game dude in the last video it's been huge to win that what do you got champ to off this game nice touch gonna beat into that then I go for a bump here good shy I think my teammate slightly missed our EURion nice tongue I should be a goal I believe in him nicely done good shot all right let's get this inner eye team a couple more times we'll get some VC dubs so I like to see if I like to see you banging the shots Finnish sucks says ah you hit those that is what I like to see this is a really good game all round from my team my team wasn't playing bad either but my team is just actually hitting the ball and it needs to be a good challenge even a merciless tiger has 94 points he's actually challenging really good it wasn't making like a crazy amount of mistakes today on the defensive end yeah the game is secured hopefully we got a good amount of points for me we should bring us up the division 3 again and then one of the next game brings us back to div 4 so we need this next one this would be huge it's been a grind trying to get a champion I'm not gonna lie to you camp 1 has been a grind to get out of because it's just so it feels so random dude it feels so so random but we got up to Division 3 after that let's get into the next game to get it up I believe I believe I'm from last game and I cannot stress enough how much we need this way we got ourselves Darth Brooks and venom and venomous 826 evermore and playing all on camera Mars but why and why is this the legacy forever I'm dead nice for my teammate this is a wetsuit shouldn't be this leggy you may just try I would have liked fat to be a pass but then again I can't even pass back so it wouldn't matter too much I'm telega let's go my team is nuts let's go that's what I like this seed I got a nice little bump there team a captain a and B two of them cuz I gotta bumped his teammate madam comes in with a clutch shot list go to you captain clutch indeed his title he's not lying he's definitely not lying man is captain clutch in the flesh we need this win dude I cannot stress enough how much we need this win waiting for the bass down super leggy kill the one I'm gonna go back here oh good job pounce on that shot nice tree to job little bit on backward boom it downfield the doink nice touch back just going for demos I guess oh he's not a challenge that I go back now this challenge I believe in my teammate you know did such to control that one of them's looking for demos a lot now and there we got to play defensive here so I can save good job my Steam address to them can't double hit it anyway that's fun nice such up to the 3-minute mark team it should go want to be behind me cuz when those died nude miss goes over him keep it off the wall uh-oh it's guys good shot let's go no we needed that dude you gotta finish those other shots we needed venom to be taking Captain Crunch from so all right off the the wall I'll go for the boost here it is to keep it in really Oh Mike come with a shot venom is what I like to see keep it up better she go nice touch good plays she's playing good together I'll they might even have I'll just go back I have boost on the tanks though I I can leave myself in a spot where I'm safe to help out whatever happens I'm saving for me good call off the wall case is bad enough teammates we're not close at all hopefully it deals with a well good job team a to follow good job well done alright looking good it's looking good maybe 40 I believe anything could happen obviously the minute 40 left I'm gonna double touches just off the wall study in this spot where I keep pressure you got over all all of them there as well probably I touch this goes down so much panic going on shot oh my god these guys won't stop saving it I'm gonna pass left clothes good try no problem good try you try buddy's in the spot for it off the back word shootable sure a lot of pressure you have going on right now it's really good can't do anything so I'm just you take the Beast will be self that pressure again I take the Beast room I know you have to go slow up that wall you know what pressure from that big miss there I mean the left in a one-on-one so like either touch a 46 boosts left I'm all into every little bit of it because we're gonna need it small is gonna be booming back our way in a second it's gotta wait there we go and I can boom it back nice and easy take the mid right eyeful again I'll be behind my team try to act as a brick wall I'm gonna shake challenge it I don't need to over address I'm gonna make the back off just play it there I can leave it put in a really weird spot for them they can't really make any kind of play going forward now this is awkward nothing is dangerous but we're good I can just slam this on home and we got the two wins today we desperately needed those wins man and we really did that's gonna get us a huge step closer to champ - he says a lot nicer place Chris you know he's not gonna shoot still to kid - all right we got the champ 1.d4 we're back up to where we were two videos ago after the end of this one
