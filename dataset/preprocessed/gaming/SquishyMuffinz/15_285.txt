this all possibility I love you so much thank you for making my dreams come true seriously enjoy the video guys yup guys gonna be playing some replay with gimmick and riddles should be some good ones let's head into the game to see how they go we got some a shock I'm Sonic's Justin Raj so yes I missed the boost so now going to well I would have actually been in a score just really sad okay first next fun oh my chato boy what the hell did how does this work gimmick dunks them into me oh my god what is that my fur gimmick touch done right side form my friend trying to keep this in nothing to be a shot maybe one dribble now it should be back yes should be fun it's such a speed I wish it weren't for that I'm so focused on the ball don't even see that guy just like tunnel vision for some reason she has this chasing me it's fine wasn't touched to anyone so there's no real danger that can come from that you wanna be falling for a little bit with no Boosh just try to get for that takes one to play maybe a girl never the head if you had it fished out four medals wasn't fast enough to go in but like straight off the shot eventually rolled it off of his touch though trying to follow such as around to I can't be there for this when you go further back right and hope it'll get that trying to play it around us fun put in the corner be a bad touch of anything jumps really awkward for that nice it's that left side 340 boost it's enough to make some sort of play here is a middle with a tee like it back off now to keep myself middles like cut up these options my man riddles go for the boost can help a little bit of keeping pressure here yes because I want for that boost to add the best turn and get that go off the rebound is good shot from gimme mid left side here public and she wasn't quite to me but I still like to try to go for that the worst-case scenario you know they beat me and you go to my team best-case scenario right they might miss and I get a go out of it still so I'll see you bad to try I'm blocked most of the net love anything you updated around I just faked shock sword I'm lucky not much you can do about that exciting to go for the boom it wasn't a great shot waiting obviously but I would have had it pretty easily if you go for the bump one thing I really do there's a few more aware that bumps coming thank you give away the ball it's fun okay reach gonna be high anyway miss patience maybe a goal pass across put a bump [Music] what is this happening wiki pin there's so low I'm gonna go keep fresh air like get some pads and turn to be perfect I meant to make him in a challenge we won like really bump heavy right now then been able to get much pressure to sit in the ball so I think that while the resorting to that I've been able to really get many touches around us for beating them so most of the the challenges so bumps is a good way when you're kind of like stuck you know what to do what's a good way to try to get out of that try to kill one myself here back in some I went through him probably just like I say everybody like and let me get back [Music] it's fun spitting up touch-free riddles three ball before a bish to deal with this should be over damn I can take mid boost go on wall free drag maybe go for a bump just all the stuff she's gonna be worse than you wanted pumps are kind of a PD in that sense where you could really just mess up someone's like anti-rotation their entire plan just by going for a single bump finish it's not enough to they don't have enough time one second kick off normally just dies off of this and let's just goes flying to the moon so only time I've ever seen it happen one second left any scale was just bad that's gonna be down I'm gonna have to go for the luggage keep baking here we go your first game I was a tough one to win it's always gonna be back and forth I'll skin to the next TV and keep it up I get we go I got the same team again the last game the video can we get the two back the banknotes we shall see I'll give me go maybe it's fine doing a mess of his teammate over 1 maybe push I missed a boost that's pretty big mistake I'd say we got to go out of it so it works but the boost just got taken now so they made a mistake I guess by not grabbing that like I should have turned right there and grabbed it probably but either way it's probably too late enough for my team of course finish it off stay behind here I trust you make on that somehow I got a safe on this so we I think you make second times gonna go backwards why I wasn't in a good spot to follow that wasn't a bad idea it stalled a lot of time and I could have actually followed it up I just wasn't ready nice free jump to know when I start a fire zone gonna beat me as closer I wanna keep it toward gimmick I was concern let's say middle you have a lot of big circuits as well there we go I don't have boots had the perfect pass this stuff fit in well done looking good you start the game you grab this pad just go back plate off the roads gonna be able to turn that's fun let sit all the way back just safer play and what is that how it's like a weird 50 doing when that boost is fun nice to be offered from maybe flush this maybe I can't go yeah I'm just gonna say middle 70 BC there we go laughs whatever happened it's like the best spot to be to be honest wait a midfield like over 70 boost you have so much time to react what's gonna happen no matter what the touch is I was so weird all I got stuck on the ceiling the past I probably missed touch plus wait on the wall you because around me it's fun I might be a girl actually very good he missed I'm so like I'm gonna build two reactors just slightly delayed my Internet's been sketchy lately oh no what is happening apologize for the leg could be a goal I can't it this is the like I have to do it unlucky when this happens so hard to play on this this happens to be an RLC I sometimes - there's nothing I can really do about it it's just most frustrating kind of leg because your planning is really good players the ball counter just teleport everywhere you have to guess what's gonna happen you really can't be working with that disadvantage I expect to win every time it's just not gonna happen so random what happens quite often Canadian internet in general isn't that great I feel like no one that I know that's Canada's quality internet we're old enough though probably have to cut the video short a tap because I can't play another one if it does this whole time it's not that left fun to play with you're still playing it also your team playing it's our last player that's what did you make o+ try to take the beach and install on me no they wanted but not bad for the leg I'm getting never got scored on yet drawl this somehow dude I didn't know if I touch that on my screen all right yeah probably Gigi's probably Gigi's my Internet I wanted to make another video playing with these guys do this fun but dogged you guys can get a taste of what my leg looks like imagine playing the best players in the world and having to react to the ball like two seconds late that's pretty much what it's like that's a just five whew so you're back you're out the window all that matters close all right hope you guys enjoyed played the same sports why it's pretty solid games that's some good goals never yeah have yourself a wonderful day or
