thanks wanna see how it goes however the first gamer playing is University of Virginia playing a university squad here alright not sure what to expect that probably goaded Ohio to read that was really a pass across from give me slice and dice those little cross passes are so good man that's where you catch people off-guard so easily pros are definitely getting better at reading it but if you do it the right time it's like super hard to stop finally get a flick nice pop for fire good follow-up oh my yeah and you get the bump as well geez HiFi spected you make your touch around I'm gonna go back all the way I gotta be sure so I was like just filled up he's gonna fake there keep my position back that way give me a challenge you and I could follow up whatever happens holy I can't say I was ready for that I don't lie to you probably touch I don't think it was yeah that was definitely not intended from him like you could try to do that and it won't work like five five out of ten times it's not gonna work look at that like half and half I feel like this didn't look like he was actually trying to go for that good shot there to bring it back I play the right side for fire oh never mind he had the perfect counter for what I was trying to do no beshear big kill from gimmick on the way back home where it's falling a little too close they're probably good situation just gonna go back a little awkward let's say I'm just gonna be tough but it's fine I'll come TV - they've been popping off I'm sure they'll win this I have full faith that could just chill I've seen giving squirty's oh I'm doing it I'm doing that I had to do it dude oh that's perfectly big material I've never done that before feels good makes me feel evil for a minute not playing by the rules this time you slice this up I'm feeling a little a little naughty after that I won't lie to you never tried that before [Music] I'm seeing harder [Music] you guys weren't expecting that out of me that's gonna be the heart of the video for sure all the comments can't believe you broke rule number I'm not gonna call it 1-0 I'm the older when it comes to rock league so to me keeping the ball zero seconds is uh rule number one that's what it used to be at least back in the day that ball was anywhere in the air everyone was keeping that up no matter the score way back good times I never troll in those locks like every sir why not do it for the content for the reaction Robert left side blocking IRA got it rolling but favorite to go lead so we have some space to troll [Music] this good bait and fire there again you don't need to win that challenge when you go for those just kind of beating out to touch the main thing they let me go for the boost Pearson eat it more I'm lucky I think you might want for the boost in turn yeah it's worth the ballgame I thought I was gonna go back after that but I probably should have just won back toward I toward not there to be safe we both turned aggressively past the fire but stay that way for my team now no kind of troll I tell you something dumb tell you something to look cool and I faked that laughs the law it fall from fire at least force them to miss there yeah is there play [Music] all right one more for the road can we do it [Music] that's good off and fire gonna be there for that you'll get back all the way every touch across shuttle block I really need to shoot that just try not to get scored on ourselves steal it nice you always got to steal this they're both ah-ha-ha all right good first game sent to the next see if we can get to back-to-back wins again still have not lost the game but did you boys so see if we can keep it up and the next one I won't break any more any more locks I promise I won't break any more I was just doing if control you guys because always I always like see me hold those for as long as possible never I've never broken one so there's your first yeah yeah yeah the next once you can keep it up again alright for last game plenteous jugaad Bambi and tool so I believe all the rest players and then Jude adds a a high grand champ as well I think I'm not mistaken I know tool and Bambi are all the rest players we'll see I'll be interesting interesting match for sure I read from gimmick it's gonna wait hopefully it's not perfect shot can't expect everyone to shoot everything perfectly you know you're just gonna end up panicking in twenty situations where you shouldn't be so you know be aware of the possibility that they can shoot well but don't ever expect every shot to be perfect that's the worst thing you could do that be careful yes your charter delay there you need to get back there's a little bit awkward maybe speed you up at everything there we go first time I really ended up going for the ball in the first 40 seconds but you know we picked that time well covered them all in there and got a good go out of it as well not too bad you know cheat here I could see far as that ball goes over my head like that and most of the time I can at least kind of react to it good in that situation but if it's like slightly back I can react it pretty easily there I got a kind of hope fires gonna have it but it was still awkward because I God didn't didn't shoot that fast shot super slow and it makes you word for fire to react to like gimmick it that all I would hit that back to him for sure if I was just going I like the confidence I was interested in he should be there it was kind of awkward but it's fine get it boom over to smoke right side so much to ask him to pass that I guess - dang I was coming from his pretty bad I should have been in a different position there let me go first nice alright only 20 of this year and I hope he doesn't bump me when she tried to do again again same situation I can't always expect if they're gonna do everything perfectly you gotta kind of hope they mess up in some spots and just kind of ignore what they're trying to do oh that's kind of unlucky obviously think he was trying to go for the ball and hit me bags in it which happens been an interesting game so far for sure I was behind me so it's my green light the challenge over to gimmick try to get behind fire here to support them when they have the ball like that I think it's always best to try to get behind your teammates to support them like that just say across when they point as the ball is almost never the right thing to do just because they're always gonna have the advantage in this place almost every single time Jonathan gimmick to be there it's a good shot I speak I control this first not the best pass for me a little fast I think wait that was bad I tried the past deck and I realized I was lost as soon as I touch as soon as I touched I was like no this is not gonna work huh I saw a glimpse of fire in the corn II should've known earlier just me being unaware better follow this go behind full this year tell you at least this 40 that's fine I get the block I don't need full boost to defend that like I follow up first year he missed so I go on the dribble killed one let us get the next really good fake from give me like that has to be worried about the high option there cuz far as reading middle that's the perfect time to fake me that one player I rushed my touch and then because I rushed it I was kind of forced to have to hit it back I should have just taken my time in my I had the pass back would have been fine I thought someone might have been able to get back in time but I shouldn't have to rely on that and not know you know I mean they're just a bad situation that I created for myself by rushing when I should have just been more patient the messing with my my distance setting a little bit recently I'm not sure if I want to use 280 or 260 that's the main thing I've been messing with go for the bump on me here gonna make the situation quite awkward but fine help me out like guys are we good we're good he's far back alright you can't do anything with this really let's guess it's super lucky 50 but like that's really low I don't really need to panic for any of these actually no boosts anywhere Oh what the heck cuz I flick it's fine should be free for fire like I I'm not really going from these balls because I don't have to there's really no reason for me to go for them they backfire doing some open space to gimmick that's fake study of that block but it's fun got the game secured pretty much unless they get this she games pretty unlikely her for the devil pretty mama backward he missed by a mile holy I could have probably dumped him if you hit that but he missed but so much again that's me kind of expecting a little too much out of him there because it was a little light to the ball holy still I shouldn't sing I was like super fast go still 94 miles per hour I boomer flick that any ready holy all right oh my I didn't mean to spam that holy okay the guys for for watching this video hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night with tempers on your Washington's like comment subscribe and see you guys all in the next one love yo peach [Music]
