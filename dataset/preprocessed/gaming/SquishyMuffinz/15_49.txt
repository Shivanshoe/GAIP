yo what's up guys for today's video going to be queueing all three game modes ones twos and threes we haven't even finished our placements for once yet we still have four games left and i think we're already top hunter which is really good so whatever we get we'll play should be a good time let's see how it goes all right the first thing we got ourselves candy against uh mendez and crisp see this goes not sure is mendes on endpoint is he the endpoint sub or something it might be it's a good first challenge for my teammate even though you got beat it still gave me the ball for free let's say i was well played from him unfortunately it should be a goal still a lot of time to shoot well done well challenge from them as well forced on my flip at a really good time i still had a very threatening play second guy had to jump and you had to expect it to be in right he knew he's gonna be over his teammate but he didn't know if he's gonna be in or not and uh luckily we had a good post bouncer i'm gonna call this should i get a good kick off hopefully it's not bad but he gets full control of this so my teammate instago i'll be back if he gets beat it should be enough me to win this ball still gotta be careful here because i can't help my teammates last back for a video let's just go awkward situation i know this guy's not gonna jump until i go for the ball so i can kind of play the 50. i don't have to panic for it i know as soon as i make a mistake he's going to go for it but if i don't make a mistake at all and let him come to me then it's not going to be any issue try to bump this guy make his life a little more difficult i'm going to fake the turn here just go back i'm gonna make him panic a bit i actually have a free ball i played over him should be good for a shot and go again for a shot of fake make a panic a bit i could turn a mid boost i'll just make him hit again here make him flick this should be easy for my teammate don't even have to commit there all that is like my presence right and you can do that any rank by the way guys it's not because i'm a pro it's not because they're scared of me at any rank if you just drive up like that they're gonna throw it away especially in lower ranks so make that mistake a lot better number one he's gonna have a save though and it should be a goal again two minutes a little far back so it won't be a goal but it's fun i'd rather play safe in situation like that then go to aggro you might miss this i'll play the whiff i should have shot it but it might still work it does i thought he would be able to recover in time so i didn't want to shut up shoot but i could have definitely shot it again playing safer there is not a bad idea at all i don't want to full commit there's something that could get me scored on right no quick for this wait it should be okay he should be back in time i hope unless he did end up getting back in time which is good didn't have a touch here all right everyone's faking each other i have no boost so it's going to be really hard to save yeah i have to block the high touch like his line toward and i have to block that my teammate kind of left for their back boost that's why i left it in a very awkward situation right because normally you want someone to be able to challenge for you so you don't have one situation that close to your net want to cut down that space before that even becomes a thing um so if your teammate does leave like that then yeah it obviously becomes a very awkward situation like this right here this guy's in a very panicked spot played it pretty well that's the best i could have done to maybe get to go to that that's a good example and that's another bad example of uh like just not good spacing between two people so my teammate just insta went when i wasn't back yeah you should try to wait for me to be a little bit further back teeny tiny bit further back that way there's a little bit of a layer on defense right if it gets over him there's gonna be someone behind him that's how you should always approach the idea of defense try not to go that's a full community of someone behind you watch what they do on defense here one first got challenges saying i can wait back it doesn't matter if i get over that first guy either look here i can't really challenge here that's something you can keep in mind on offense too because you can kind of base your plays around what they're going to be doing next right that's good maybe both on the jump you may should have a free net ended up missing but it is okay a-okay get my time here try to bait him in let him hit that it's fine try to go again here just walk the pinch don't let him have that pitch toward right now right it doesn't really matter where it goes off that but a little bit awkward might be a goal yeah then looks like my teammates get beat there but it's okay stuff like that does does indeed happen you have to try to be ready to adapt to both situations you can also look at that as your own fault as well like you want to have faith in your teammate you also want to be in a position where if they do mess up because they will mess up a lot especially in solo queue um you want to be there for it as well right and i wasn't there to cover his mistake that's also my fault in that situation yeah all the goals this game it's a good example of um you know what not to do in terms of challenging i feel like there's been a lot of situations where there's like way too big of a gap on the challenges so it's really hard for um you know one of us to follow up on each other's challenge which is not good and it's a lot easier to pull that off in threes obviously like properly spaced challenges and making sure someone's behind you at all times and twos you really got to pay attention to where your teammates at try to kill time for them to get back before you challenge they look at my teammates challenge right there right look at the situation i'm in now you don't want to ever be left in a woman for this long with no help gonna be really awkward every single time i did well to kill time for him to get back right but you try to like avoid leaving your teammate in that situation as much as possible this is a really tough one to get out of most of that time should be fine just yeah i wish i like make a touch that's it's lofty enough where i can get back behind my teammate already and help him out again i don't want to leave him back for too long i don't want him to potentially make a mistake where he challenges without me being back and i can't help him right i don't mind if wasted all his boosts bring into our corner it's fine again awkward situation right i don't really have that much help but we got a bit well i'm not going to shoot off that because again it's a little bit risky let's find the challenge and i still have my 80 boost gotta be careful here the teammate creeped up a little bit far i wanna get bumped a lot of time here just look at the boost and win this ball nice got to be careful and it's happening a little too much or i'm definitely lost back for a little bit longer than i should be but notice that every time i'm in that position i'm trying to kill time for him to get back right i'm not going to dive early to the point we're just going to get a score on for free i want to try to time my challenge in the right way so the team's behind me now i can go should force them high and my team should be back well that's something i'm always looking for and in threes that's like honestly the most important thing i think these days when you time that challenge making sure your teammates behind you can get an actual good hit out of it stuff like that i'm trying to go for a shot off that trying to beat the first guy should be good to turn on now trying to block him block again might be awkward hopefully my teammate plays safe here really good situation to go now should have the win and now he is i want going for free this is where you should move a little bit faster try to like take advantage of the 1v1 for a while but still be okay here try to play it over him trying to keep it close is a good play stay at midfield here close good touch he had just the slight enough touch to the side keep that out there timmy should go just to be an okay he's going behind me so that's my my q to go now at that point that's fine we did a good job with that this challenge like look at the problem with what he just did right he won the challenge but he ends up falling for super long time anyways to always do so i have to play that next such super passive or else we pretty much lose full control like the whole play but i don't play the next situation super passive like i did there pick both of them by not going play it off the wall left the wall again got to block them they have a really low boost here you should go again here let them hit this off the corner for my teammate it should turn places oh you can't turn in time but if you played it right well to me it went back and played it right what would have been a perfect play probably led to a goal to be honest over one let him hit that it's fine teammates should have for free now sort of soft touch good demo it's gonna create some space i'll play this middle instead of shooting wasn't quite ready but it's fine i also don't blame them for not being ready because most people in twos really do not pass that so i do not blame them at all but yeah good job to take advantage of that at the end i had to play very safe in a lot of situations and that's like it's a really hard thing to to gauge like how to do it properly and i think even i make the mistake sometimes you gotta really be careful on twos not to like full commit or keep yourself too often and like the opponent's half and not get behind your teammate always make sure you try to get behind your teammate and support them so they can challenge for you and um never really leave too much space where they're 1v2 for too long it happened a lot that game where on both teams or someone that would go for a challenge and would land super late and then some would be 1v2 or 1v1 for way too long you always want to have someone layered that can help you out um either way good first game we got the win so the end of the day all worked out let's get into one more see if we can get back to back dubs let's see how it goes right we got a sweaty game here for the last game we have corrupted g against t curl and pan so pretty solid lobby both um at least all the twos players are playing against i'm not sure how much gabe actually plays these days because i know he's he's a coach now for rogue i'm not sure he still plays a lot but i'm sure he'll be solid wait for his next touch bake them press down this get a flip actually really good safety crowd that's gonna be gonna be a goal for sure that's a super risky shot to go for i feel like okay my opinion the best bet here if you're gabe i try to just hit it around like try to hit it to the corner to his left or something don't go for a shot especially if you don't have anyone behind you right unless you know for sure it's a goal not the best idea to just try to like yolo it and just hope it goes in right by fake nice this is a good play good patience say yeah i think just the idea of like hitting around people and trying to just use like your space is really important so i get to the right there i didn't go for a shot straight away and then i opened up as an opportunity to like have a free shot right don't try to go for a shot that's not free or not going to be a gold there's no point you're really wasting you waste your possession and you waste like all the pressure you built up to that that moment it's better only to go for a shot if you know for sure it's going to lead to something useful or a goal for sure that's a good touch around though that's really smart from game well done let's pop it mid let him have that's fine probably going to control go for a 50. really really good touch from gabe might even be too cool close don't want to me on that but i can bump him off now it's perfect good baited of his flick and then a really good bump to get him off the ball smart play i'm not going to follow that because i still have some boost here trying to go for a gap here it's fine let him hit this check controller to the corner shouldn't go for i'd be careful here now i'm going to want me one for a while it's a really good save i'd be careful though not the best bounce for me a little bit of awkward situation that might be tough it should be good you threw it away hit it back go how do you want to flip yourself there would have been really dangerous i think yeah really really tough situation oh yeah i don't i don't have someone behind me there so i have to just hope i have to play one of the angles like one of the situations right so i was playing just him hitting it kind of just forward at me and he ended up getting a good scoop under the ball honestly messed up his first touch pretty badly and then ended up recovering out of it which is good of him can't really challenge that be careful let me go for this one though just in case that way you can't go their third man i said third man but just their last name back because it's twos literally like i bumped through four though i feel like coming back i think bumping that guy is really useful gabe doesn't have any boost though so there's no way we could really create a play out of that and i have to be careful here too better back wall again try to stay on this i'm going to get bumped though nice chest day good job unfortunately it didn't die if you actually got demo there it would have probably been really good for us but the patience on the 50. the block as well should be a shot close nice those really good patience there this game is uh maybe a hard one for sure it's gonna be a a sweaty one goes to the very end that'll play a situation very smart look for the very few opportunities very few mistakes that we'll be able to capitalize on it is winnable for sure played over one no oh my god he misses good if gabe just left that i had like a really good opportunity to score i think there's a good one going but it's fun i don't have a flip anymore so i was actually good to go for that play one middle first shot [Music] can't really go for this he calls going to be there too quick should be able to challenge for me nice uh i was actually pretty bad from t crow he messed up his teammate left him in like a really really poor spot but recovered all of it so that's all you can ask you make the mistake if you make up for it it's all you can really do right should be a goal nice good job again just taking advantage of their mistakes right there's been a lot of mistakes from both sides to be honest there's been a lot of things uh both of us could be doing better here but a lot of these two's games can feel random i think two is just one of those very randomly feeling game modes i don't think they're the best uh way to practice if we're trying to just get more solid but it definitely there's some good and bad tattoos i think but i think there's more bad in terms of habits that you can create because it makes you really selfish i think a lot of the two players are very very selfish the way they have to play because it is smarter to take things solo in twos and to try to pass you normally get punished really hard when you try to pass in twos so two just naturally does make you very selfish i think it's just something that happens unfortunate though baby got killed that's a good 50 from from panda [Music] hopefully gabe can go there nice [Music] i thought it would go so i tried to just play a touch around them but did a good job to play it safe you should go for me it's a challenge is fine it should be dead all right we got an ot here let's see it's all in the kickoff i think not the greatest for us if i can pop it i beat one which is good i'm not gonna go again yet and then i can go after it's a good patience and i got killed it's actually i think it's beneficial for me spawns me back now it's awkward because gabe can actually help me but should be okay a lot of situations today are those there's only ones like that i'm dead again just chasing demos we're almost at a thousand points already holy it's a good bump i'm going to fake jump here but i can go back now gabe should just go here any kind of touch that you force him to do is good number one he goes actually not bad for me at all you can show up the wall unfortunately both of them for the same booster lose pressure per second here gotta control this last back for a while should be fine this could be dangerous gotta beat him again actually was open for a second let me go all the way back should take the mid boost and turn for me just make him do anything here it's good i thunk but it's fun if i bumped him into it now it's actually huge probably going to be a goal honestly it's off the bump wouldn't have any help for a while just trying to stay on this i don't need to do anything let's drive into it should go for me again just force any kind of play maybe more than enough good job we're almost scored just off of that like off of him though you're just winning the challenge that's really good i don't touch this can't shoot off this but i can maybe leave forgave i want to try to take this mid boost and just pressure it's fine it's actually really good as long as gabe can go here we're good nice it's passed to the left i don't know if you'll use it he actually tried surprised pretty rare you see someone try to go for like a mid pass like that ensues especially this level i don't disagree with that i think it can be good but it's just something you don't see very often a lot of very awkward uh situations going on here running at a boost slowly gotta be careful it's not looking good for us to be honest these situations we're on the back foot a lot of these luckily i read that i got away with it there we go downside of the mid patch right especially playing someone that's used to defending passes a lot you're gonna be in a vulnerable position quite often we had 1230 points that's a hard one to win it's a very hard one to win we we did well though didn't make too many mistakes i think there was a lot of mistakes in general from both sides like as a team but individually we didn't make that many mistakes which is good that's all you can really ask for good games though for today definitely a hard fought two really intense games to be honest hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are
