before we get into the video guys a quick thank you we've recently reached six hundred thousand subs we're gaining so many cells per day you guys are really coming through to try to help me get to 1 million subs before the end of the year and we're well on track to reaching it way before the end of the year if we keep up at this rate we've gained a crazy amount of new subscribers in the last couple of days so thank you so much guys you guys have been incredible I'm glad you're enjoying the series if you're not subbed right now please go down below the channel press the subscribe button and press the bell as well so you can help me reach 1 million subscribers I love you so much guys enjoy the video yo what's up guys from the last video we finished off at diamond 3 division 1 we're 1103 mm ah right now so hopefully by the end of this video we can maybe get ourselves into champ 1 I'm not hundred percent sure maybe if one of the games ends short with a forfeit or something we'll play an extra one I might be able to get into champ off of that but we'll see let's get into the games and hopefully we can keep up our 100% win rate and hopefully we can play to the same level as a diamond and not to much more than so it's getting to however the first game of the video to clean against pure legacy and toast senpai 11:54 10:13 we have 1110 on our team because you guys are all diamond 3 I think oh except for the 1013 you get oh no I pass to them ok save that that's pretty nice this guy is an Xbox player I think these bolter - most players wait maybe they're all Xbox players I don't even know if Xbox can play ps4 you DNA's gonna cut in front of me it's fun you kill me and drop them my fault you gettin away this ok they can Ariel that's my permission Ariel granted as soon as I see that that is my my green light - Ariel clam jam silver I kind of like that nanded got a ring to it it's gonna bang this suit he does I think he's gonna miss so let's just wait a situation like this just wait see what they do if he if he panics to that sure freak cool if not then whatever happens happens just gonna hit it back to your teammate most likely I'll jump for this like I'd beat one to it slightly wide she's gonna pop that there all right still missing on easy Ariel's in diamond 3 so the throwing it on that strat is still very useful it's all serious pretty much just one big experiment just to see when it starts getting actually like tough and you can't like just straight-up bang shots I'm going hope for the best because up till now I've been able to just literally just shoot from anywhere and it can eventually go in if you shoot enough times but should it really be the case in high ranks I don't think I'm a knowing grand champ like if you shoot enough it'll work but that's just because they eventually get a bat touch so I'll never miss like an easy shot really if you if you shoot it in it's like not that fast they're almost never gonna miss a save on that pass to my teammate nice pass back kind of not really I tried to use them because I felt bad I felt like I was just ball hog a little kill he passed him and you didn't get the touch that you wanted you could tell you're trying to pass back though I like the idea I have it played against the champs or champ twos and like to be two in a long time so I'm really curious to see the difference in rank playing those guys not gonna go for this okay I can go for this ball it's in the air free game it was gonna shoot a bad shot again when I am going for aerials that are high like that I'm gonna shoot it as if I'm a diamond I'm not gonna place it like super super high I'm gonna shoot it like low that way it kind of like resembles if I'm a diamond players practicing aerials and it's consistent hitting the ball but not very well it's all I was trying to to show really that you don't need a perfect shot you just need to be in the right position to shoot the shot played over him and I'm gonna leave this my teammate even that's a free goal for me I just want to see how you react to the situation I was like good 50 i'ma let him bang this to me I'm gonna fake challenges as he does okay there we go I pass it to my teammate I pass it back to my teammate back to my teammate the try that like some fatty flavor my teammate I like that $50 good I like that he's passing back to me every time he trusts me so there you go you could do that with your teammates and diamond as well if that affect I understood what I was going for diamond three xbox player definite not impossible to get the pass and plays for your teammates good say well then get the path of pads and the way back fill up completely already stole that one pad but it's fine should I just get a bad touch on that is it from na fully shut ariel try to set him up middle I'll just pop this wants maybe I never I mean I'll try to get like a bad pop let's see what they do and the shadowing in forcing is just flicked my baiting him let's say team I should have this guess fun I got the same okay I'm gonna turn him it went back so that's my my cute or just turn on that can make me go for this no more for my teammate most likely and then I could follow this shot okay I thought he might've turned holy I don't know if he was going for that but again all I did there bad shot on goal like it wasn't placed a wall by any means but I just timed it perfectly off the bounce so it's fast and people are really good at saving this fast shot so we're gonna they're gonna expect too much in this right they don't know that not everyone's gonna hit every shot perfectly it they don't understand that yet I guess so they kind of get panicky whenever the ball is blasted even though it's not like well-placed you could literally stay on the line single jump and save that shot even though it is fast you don't need to panic for shots like that sound literally just turning and just trying to shoot as fast as possible from everywhere you hit the ball the max speed that you can pretty much hit it when you're going like supersonic I think it's like 68 miles per hour if you hit it at that speed at every shot it's gonna be pretty hard for them to save that's not like the max speed but like it's around 68 miles per hour 6278 68 to 70 I should say if you time it off and bounce properly Hashemites unit if you hit it at that speed that's gonna be pretty hard for them to react or go so we're getting it from then you can practice that like I said pretty easily just spend some time in free play make some shiny packs for yourself or you have to just bounce the ball a little job down here I'm not gonna fold it up on to save my boosts Timmy's gonna have I'll stay middle if he wants to use me I'm here keep it up gonna have the touch these guys are good like that that was a good touch that was a good touch to lose a good shot so not bad by any means like they know how to do this and I sucked off the wall and I was good patience and I get shot as well actually really good play at the end there the guy is a gold avatar border so he's at least level 1300 which is kind of nuts so those were pretty experienced that's a good one and they say that the entire time so I don't know for each champ today after only gaining 30 points a game here we're 1134 now champagne three div to win one more probably at like eleven sixty LLC scan to the next one so you keep it up but those guys were pretty solid it's getting to the next all right so play 1151 1153 on our team all 1100 why am i why why why why am I doing this why am i doing I was already committed to it I won't do that again for the rest of the year okay it is kind of funny it is kind of funny though like the reactions I won't lie I mean like if you guys wanted to just for the fun of it I could play a whole series rather you just like try out and just go for like a bunch of like stealing shots double taps and dribbles like flipping sets I could do a higher order grand champ in like 1v1 actually maybe I should in threes I couldn't 3v3 why just go for a bunch of that stuff and just to see the reactions of everyone turn off cross play that way it's all PC players you can see reactions I could do that I feel like at the very beginning it'll just be everyone calling me a smurf but then after that it'll get funny once it's like kind of reasonable like it's reasonable that a diamond could maybe do what I just did so I see why he's like freaking out and not like getting mad about it I was trying to beat them both let my team over for you gonna yeah if you guys want to see something like that I'd be down I think it'd be funny let it get middle they both still panic okay that still works somehow he made this man dropped a loon this is Kev's game this is indeed my game you know I call kickoff hideki off from them not bad I got the bump though I mean is he making out a shot I could pump this dude there we go nice that's just good positioning that's stressing my team that he's gonna beat that guy and then all I gotta do is kill the last nice shot for my teammates our job did beat him close above - at least they put his back up that everyone Oh to try they're both still panicking that's one thing that that stayed consistent through all these ranks to be fired everyone's consistently still panicking on stuff that they probably shouldn't be like it's not even dangerous dangerous situations and they're just panicking oh please please I don't know why I'm going for all this stuff this game dude I cause I'd be playing all these games just limiting myself eluding myself but limiting myself I just want to go home oh I try to go for cool stuff what did this guy say hold on I'm usually really good you're lucky all right so pretty pretty uh usually kidding Ken's stuff he's a sit down yep of course all right pretty pretty quality game pretty quality game not gonna lie diamond three deep three 1162 after that ended early so you know that means we'll do one more game I was having fun going for some like cooler stuff that game I really do miss it can't lie to you I'd be missed on for stuff that people don't really usually see in diamonds and stuff like that but I did say I'd stick to my word and not go for too much so I'm not gonna do that anymore for the rest of the video I don't know why I pulled out a dumb flip reset the beanie of that game and I was like whatever I'll go for it hooks pinch why not so let's get them next I won't do that for the next game I promise but we'll try to play to like whatever level we're seeing in the game all right so unless we gain 38 points out of this game I don't think we're getting shampoo on this this video but at least we could save it for the next point against Steve and geek geek all right these guys don't look bad by any means you have toxic on our team I wonder if he's actually toxic senior for this pop it over this dude's gonna be a hard for him to get that yeah I guess I'd people still uncomfortable when the ball is above their head that is what I've noticed in this rank when the ball gets thrown above your head people still don't know how to deal with that like they're not comfortable with everything like that he said that was hot so is that not something these guys do all the time I don't know okay oh my god that was on gold in a profit day slightly on target Bailey I'm not gonna go straight for that - TV panics actually good patience but yeah I don't know if that's patience or if that's just not reading that I'm gonna be there first because I would I would have beat him for sure being able to score so I'm not sure that's patients who just him not knowing but the right place there is to wait regardless because you're not saving that ball if if they do shoot you're not saving it so you might as well wait don't get faith probably not gonna get back to the the reading time anyway okay I'm trying to do it like super slowly and something that Donnie players like definitely are able to do but it's just they don't don't have like the consistency to do it like I've said it's all about just consistency like it's it's crazy to me how if you just practice a mechanic over and over again you'll get so much better I feel like people lower rank just don't take enough time practicing one single mechanic holy what a shoddy it's like that right there that's a perfect shot yeah that's such a good shot if you could practice doing stuff like this every time you have open space with a ball that's bouncing that's all you need literally all you need you'll get yourself to at least can to like that's it's so much simpler than people make it out to be in terms of reaching grand shape it really just comes down to like consistency that's why a lot of the series all I've been doing is just trying to be in the right spots just trying to like shoot shots fast but mainly just being in the position to be able to shoot those so like I know where he's getting this ball next so I'm gonna wait around here you can't really get out of this position you have to throw it up to me and then I have a free shot so it's really just positioning yourself according to what they're gonna do next that's literally the whole point of what I'm trying to show you guys in this series is you don't need ceiling shots you don't need flip presets you don't need any of this stuff to to rank up you just need to know how to read their game plan and that's something that's so underrated reading the gameplay mixed with banging shots from pretty much anywhere on their side of the field if you can just get that shot at the max possible speed you're good to go man my teammates saw this is a visit dub I don't see us losing this game we keep it up already about five golde cameras gonna take one touch here I play this to my teammate middle Sunni does good trying the shot so you know he's gonna beat me something away this doesn't beat some just fake challenging it's fine you may can get this for free nice [ __ ] up one more touch here good try I'm gonna fake challenge okay I was a good mom yeah I like to just try to get in the way it's by bumping someone do you have this for free nice I got some pads and position middles my teammates gonna obviously try to get this toward goal at some point right so why not just a middle because it's either gonna go toward the net go off the backboard or go toward me and every single one of those outcomes what happens above those middles so why not pre position there it's gonna make you faster than them that's the whole idea of being fashioned in the other player there's just positioning better than them if you're in a better position you're gonna beat them to the ball no one has a faster car no one has a faster boost everyone gets to every ball at the same time if they jump from the exact same point they're gonna get to the ball at the same time but you got to be in a better position than the opponent you gotta be in a position where you gonna have momentum like I know I could beat this guy to this ball cuz I have momentum going to wear that ball I'm closer I know what he's gonna do I'm not panicking for any of these balls and I know what their intent is to measure to have that goes way on defense again let's try to let them give us a goal so you pop it there I'm gonna pop it around in one I'm just gonna bang this it's gonna be a wide by bit really it's such that was good though made it in one for free absolutely nothing had to be done and then the shot was just slightly wide but I'm gonna let him hit this to me okay that's fine too you miss I don't let her hit this me as well look I just got a free ball for doing literally nothing there we go justkeep fake challenge them until you give me the ball and then once I have the ball nice and easy empty net at that point can we just have one goal please I mean the man said please dude he said please we got to do it for him there yo Steve what Steve oh you don't want to save us men all right they quit we gave him a free goal and you would have seen this man all right he said take that nerds get [ __ ] on shooters damn alright guys what do we finish off at 1187 so next video if we win the first game wound up at champ Warner ready so we're ready getting to the champ ranks not too bad at all
