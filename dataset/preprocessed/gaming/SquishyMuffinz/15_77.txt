yo what's up guys so a lot of you guys seem to enjoy the workshop video that i just recently did so i saw a lot of the comments saying to do some rings maps and one of the most requested ones that i had seen was the neon uh rings map by lethamer i believe it is i haven't played this at all yet i haven't even touched it so it's going to be our first run through we'll see how clean we can do it hopefully it's not too long i have no idea how long these rings maps are so hopefully it's not one of the really long ones so let's get into it i'm worried it's going to be a big map because it's taking a long time to load it took a really long time to live so let's get into it i always like the vibe to the rings maps though i feel like they're really chill so i like the bottom a lot i used to do them a lot more than i do now but i've always enjoyed the idea of them for sure my problem is i try to get too fancy on some stuff and you should kind of do it the simplest way possible but i've always liked to practice in like a harder way i don't know i've always felt like if you practice making yourself uncomfortable doing things rather than doing it the simplest way possible it's always going to make you improve more so i try to do it the most difficult way if i can same way with like free play for me i'm trying to practice stuff i try to make it as difficult as possible i feel like that's going to be the best form of practice for me this has a death counter the top left so we'll see how many times we die i'm going to predict like 30 probably probably it's really hard towards the end these first few levels haven't been too bad what normally gets me is i'm going too fast i don't turn early enough so i normally die on these maps i don't know i'm supposed to land like i don't know what's actually better for these because i know there's people that speed run this stuff i'm not sure if they land or they just keep flying through i'm guessing landing will be better especially for some of them you like keep your flip i know i'm holding arrow right through all this by the way guys but i don't know if that's even better to do either i think when i used to watch like the speed runners do this kind of stuff they like just straight up don't air roll they just do this the whole way through i'll try to do like a speedrunner does feels weird to me now but they don't they don't really arrow they kind of just do the most efficient thing possible which is just this this is a weird level can i land on this wall i don't know if i can so i'm just going to stay in the air i don't think you can it's probably just on there i was really tempted to though i thought it would have been pretty cool looking let me know by the way guys any like workshop maps or any like rings maps that you guys want to see me do because i actually really enjoy these videos they're really chill i like him a lot oh we almost messed up all right we're good we're good i wonder if you can use that to your advantage to like getting bumped up off the ring like that so i got the focus for a second i thought i was gonna lose it all right we're gonna start getting a little bit slower here i think i almost died right there because it's going too fast around the corners like right here i have to slow down really early dude i don't know what it is when i play these i get so relaxed such a different vibe than like playing rank and also like i always get this question when i'm streaming on twitch and like doing maps like this if someone asks me to do when i'm streaming um if this is actually good practice i do think it is good practice just to understand how to control your car in the air understanding like how much boost is required to stop your momentum or go left or go right how the speed in general works when you're you're going in the air being able to slow down and cut corners quickly i mean you don't need that in the real game obviously but it just will help you in general i think so little things that you can actually apply to your game i think that will definitely benefit you so it's not a bad idea to try some of these maps and they're just fun as is so you want to have some fun also helps you improve a little bit definitely try this map same as the dribble maps we actually haven't died yet so i'm very surprised about but i feel like that's definitely going to change this is 100 my first walk through guys i have not played this map before i'm literally just going through it as it trusts me i'm surprised i haven't died yet i don't even know how long this thing is i don't even remember if i pressed record that would suck if i didn't press record this is the crazy run i feel like i actually don't know how good this run is compared to what it could be but oh no okay we're good okay i press record we're good i had to look or landing right there i feel like the rings are getting closer together so i gotta be a little bit safer slow down a little bit so i'm feeding my boots right there because stuff like that right there i could have just lost i've hit the rims a couple of times but i haven't wait wait are we good oh my gosh that was close i really don't want to die now i'm trying to perfect this but i don't know how many levels this is i'm guessing like 30. from five minutes in or maybe not though because i haven't died i feel like i'm probably doing this pretty quick i went through this oh that always gets me i gotta slow down a lot okay there's gonna be something really hard i feel and then i'm just gonna mess it up i'm gonna be sad if i mess it up oh no okay oh oh my gosh i think we like skimmed the ground i'm too scared to arrow here very good this is well done map though it's a solid map it is by lefty i think so shout out to left me for the map quality stuff oh god this looks weird it goes down kinda i gotta slow down here i hate because the camera gets so weird oh no well i've never had a rings map that does this the boost is blinding yeah it's all about like feathering your boost that's what i mean it teaches you a good boost control same thing here they just do a lot actually about how their car reacts to speed and stuff obviously i have a pretty good idea of it because i've played the game for like 14 000 hours but in general it'll teach you a lot if you don't know much about it i think you'll learn pretty quickly how it all works feathering your boost is a very very important thing in the actual game too so this will teach you a pretty good skill in that okay we're a little too fast i think but i think we're good we might be able to just ship oh no no no no no wait no i died no i died man i'm so sad i didn't realize there was one up there i didn't look that far ahead i'm so sad i wanted to to perfect it i definitely could if i did it again for sure it's all good though i feel like i could at least but i also don't know what comes next knowing lefty probably has like the last level being super super hard or something i also don't know how much longer we even got i'm really hoping this is 20 and not 30 because i feel like if it's 30 and there's like a really hard last 10 levels i'm gonna have a hard time with it i don't know what kind of stuff they put in these these rings maps these days this is a fun part like this all right we're doing pretty good 18 and we only died one time and we kind of trolled we just didn't pay attention to what was ahead of us so not too bad [Music] i guess you could argue that kind of teaches you that too kind of teaches you to like you gotta be like really focused in your peripheral vision as well so you can kind of see what's coming up next teaches you quite a few things i think pretty valuable ah started that way too quick yeah a little bit slower on that two deaths i don't know why i'm upset at the fact that we have two deaths but it's all good i feel like i could have avoided both of them that's why wow this looks like there's a lot more left this is one of the harder levels so far i think because you have to like really control your speed around these corners i think that's the end of it right there no no all good oh good i i got too antsy i got too antsy i deserved that way to go all the way up again man oh man i'm gonna take my time more this time if i was doing it safely i didn't want to mess up at all i would probably do this i don't think i don't think i could mess it up if i just did this and went slowly it's also not as exciting to watch i think it's the fact that i could die at any moment when i'm spinning around that makes it enjoyable [Music] all right so this is either the last level or there's going to be 10 more so i'm kind of hoping it's the last one most of these maps are like 20 levels or 30 so i'm really hoping it's the last one it's already 10 minutes we've been playing so i don't want this to be super long video dude oh my recovering though i'm gonna slow down a lot i can't see the boost wow this is so disorienting ah yeah i knew i'd go too fast man i knew i'd go too fast i'm focused i don't want to mess it up again i don't want five deaths if i get five deaths that's a failure in my book brought too fast again i got it i gotta chill i gotta chill i gotta chill just feather my boost nice and easy nice and easy all right i think we got it if i just slow down here all right we're good i think no no no no no no no no no dude you have to slow down so much man i think honestly i really think that's the end of the map and the sad thing is if i had zero deaths up to that point i think i would have died there for sure that would have been so sad i would have been more sad i got zero all the way up to that and then just died at the very end this is a fun map though honestly the background is super distracting to me i keep looking at the buildings all right i'm taking my time for sure this time for sure all right we got it we got it i slowed down enough that time all right not bad not bad five five deaths in 12 minutes 17 seconds not bad i i can't complain about that for the first time going through this map can't complain about that let me know what you guys think about uh these kind of videos if you guys want to see more of these kind of rings videos let me know what map you want to see me do down below i will get back into the rank videos obviously it's only been two videos since i've done a ranked one but i will get back into it i just wanted to switch up a little bit you guys did like the last workshop videos hopefully you'll like this one and uh yeah love you guys thank you for the support on the channel i'll see you guys all in the next one like comment subscribe peace you
