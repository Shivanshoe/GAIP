yo what's up guys so we're finally back from the la major and we're here with the brand new car that just came out it's the brand new lamborghini um we actually did a video with the old lamborghini i actually really like this one a lot i think that this one looks a lot worse than the old one did but either way hopefully it plays well we'll just see we'll just play some games with that play two games today hopefully we can get some dubs let's get into it play some twos let's see how it goes all right the first time we got ourselves ozzy against uh jrips and zoom all righty been a while since i've hit the rank jungle here just goes bang oh my oh my i was just coming in with the absolute banger off the bat actually crazy shot really good shot he got so crazy on this car unless their kickoffs have just been bad i'm not sure one of the two like you're also very important ensues and threes but and choose obviously there's one less player to beat so you can get such a huge advantage if just that cheater wins the the ball over the next guy we've done that both times so far see if that carries on here try to save some boost as a cheater my team i could do something good with this as well bumps actually pretty good there nice i got the clothes the whole time let's get playing instead of just playing across the panicking it's really good to keep that close a lot more threading especially my teammates bumping i know he's not gonna be able to receive a pass way better to keep it close try to make a play myself and he did a good job we got both of them teammates going absolutely beast mode right now going crazy take my time here wind up a good shot there we go i didn't think you'd expect me to stay and it worked all right so this car has uh been good so far i've gotten four goals 30 seconds i don't know it's just a good game or if the car's just good luck but i'm taking the ball myself sorry teammate i'm trying out how it feels in the air i messed up but it's all good nice okay i almost didn't get back down to in time but good job not sure if my team was trying to shoot or trying to pass that but it works out regardless yeah it was wide by a little bit so it's a good shot good to go for those solo like floaty editable plays especially if you have no pass middle just because it forces them to have to hit it back to your team every time like almost always going to be pressure gained for your team if you go for that first touches here try to fake him a bit give me a good job to go back here i still have 80 boosts we can do something with this again i'm just going to go for a solo play here maybe go for a bump close if you get the bump there it's probably a goal so it's a good play to make effect let's go for a second pop over him nice really good job let's stay close to that i probably didn't expect me to just go for the straight up beat there it's always a smarter play let me go for a shot switching a situation like that i feel like people don't do that enough even when you get a pass you don't always have to go for a shot i think that's something that's like definitely overdone by people is just always going for a shot immediately off the pass try to hit it around your opponent trying to break them down a bit make it play out a bit like that instead so much better like here i don't need to go for a shot straight away and fake first make it hard for him but i get in this head a bit instead of just going for a shut up shot keeping possession and keeping the ball close is so much more valuable especially my teammate stuck like that well i'm gonna go for a quick shot and he saves it and then we're in a situation we have to rush back right keeping control so much better in those spots better played around them here go to the wall soft touch to myself played around one maybe my teammate that was actually good patience from him though not so rich man that was awkward nice pass that touch wasn't needed probably but didn't turn out too bad i was close not something crazy smash my teammate i'm gonna go for a pinch here let's just wait pick this put it around one wall he's gonna have the next touch back and when the boost at least let me go back and save all my boots i can help out if needed i'm gonna save my boost here again because most likely whatever comes next is going to be a soft touch toward me if he's dribbling this if not i can just go for this honestly yeah if they if they challenge that off my teammate it's most likely going to be something soft coming toward me so it's good to have full boost in a position to actually follow that up one fake jump here make him throw it away same thing here fake jump turn just make him throw it away the whole time i keep my positioning right it's actually really a play to make my first touches i'm gonna say my boost or for my time to actually make a play on this ball me not just instantly going for that i actually faked them so hard right there and i have all this to work with it might make it come and maybe win that 50. let's try it's a good boost one for him i might probably at least get the ball out for a second but we still have pressure here i'm gonna let him do solo play and better than committing two of us to something that he's accomplishing the same thing with one anyway there's no point it's fine he doesn't have any follow-up assume it's dead i know that so i can just keep 15. no threat there at all but always like evaluate like what kind of thing they have in the stream like here's just a solo play and it's going to be a solo play the whole time as soon as he doesn't have a flip i can literally just sit here and there's no danger that's kind of what i'm doing every time someone has the ball the seem it's behind him here it's again just going to be a solo play a lot of times twos it will be just over and over just a solo play taking turns and stuff like that so you have to overthink it and threes is a lot harder because this could be people on your your blind spot like coming from like the side you're not ready for a lot more uh random variables in threes for sure way way harder to keep track of everything that's going on and twos though you normally can tell pretty easily close i almost got around for the flip i'm not exactly comfortable on this car yet like trying to do stuff like that so looks a little odd but on octane i would definitely be able to make a play out of that but good first game actually really saw the car feels good so far again though like long cars just never really have felt like really good to me but for some reason every time i do these videos they feel super good at the start so i definitely uh take that first game performance against the next one so you can keep it up get back to big dubs see how it goes all right for last time we got blue against masseter and batali using the purple for the blue team because i wasn't sure what to use honestly all the other colors look so dull i just hate that you don't have like crazy customization options but i usually don't have like crazy car designs anyway so doesn't matter too much for me but i feel like it really takes away from the car not having much to choose from take my time here we have some space pick the 50 but around one it's a good play the mid pads on the way back that way i'm still able to turn whenever i need to let him hit that it's fine tried something crazy i almost got the touch i wanted take my time on this and take my time let the ball bounce it's a really good demo and i still have control of this to make it take it's actually gonna work out i don't think he has boost that's the only thing i really liked about that what he just did is that he didn't have boost i think and he still took it but not a bad play at all if you have a boost because whoever has more booster can make the better player right so you want to like definitely not take it from your teammate if you're low but it's also not bad in a situation where you know you can for sure get the ball middle and into this power you can score push could have it again i can't like focus it to a pass on a pre-jump yeah because it is two in threes i would definitely try but and twos if i like full commit to the pass there i feel like it's going to get me scored almost a time not the best idea to and just staying in a spot where i can react to good and bad that might happen there i just beat him here that's my job complete i'll go for a bump on him i'm not i don't know how i put her on the other guy be honest made him pop it which is really good maybe a shot here i hope my team would stay as well because if he stayed there was definitely be cool go for the hard shot but oh my god i'll actually perfect touch i'm trying to get like a shot a bit i'm not gonna lie so i went silent for a second and throw it away it's fine run this now keep it close let him hit that should be okay timmy should be back good job i have full space on this ball now for a dribble here i didn't get a flip out of that i just don't know where like the exact spot to get a flip on this car is because on octane it's so easy and this car just feels so odd i gotta flip the way that guy jumped and we challenged it was definitely gonna be a goal but it was good to use our time like that and again we still kept so much pressure because we did that might be eagle unfortunately i want to see what happened on the cheat it's probably a common the common mistake that usually happens yeah okay he honestly tried to guess which is like never what you should do on a sheet so you try to like guess which way to go i would recommend staying right here and reacting rather than trying to pre-turn because you don't actually gain much from pre-turning like oh yeah i was in a bad spot after the miss all good you don't get anything for pre-turning really the only even like in a situation where um like you spawn like you get demoed and you try to like pre-turn your wheels to get a quote-unquote advantage it really doesn't help you more more often than not like that extra second won't save you if you're in that position already you're probably screwed so i'd recommend just to play like as soon as your eyes can react to it play that turn then don't try to like pre-turn because it's really not going to gain you much and the cheat there that was like the mistake that happened there and it's very very very easy one to not let happen my teammate still wasn't back i don't even know what happened he mostly got bumped on their hat and then the other guy just panicked because he thought he should have been back i'm gonna go out of this for some reason i don't know i have no idea but what happened there definitely was like my teammate should have for sure been back i guess he got bumped somewhere in midfield that's why i like took so long to rotate and that guy that was trying to shoot definitely panicked thinking he would be back didn't realize how much time he actually had and then we just got a counter out of all that absolute mess that just took place but happens a lot especially in ranked we're taking that 50 like that not like full flipping into it because i can get back so much easier it's gonna be awkward should be okay though good timing to get the boost might make us be able to get out of the situation hoping that like i didn't bump my teammate because if he did we were actually in just a terrible situation oh that's a good try should be back should be fun kill the last guy as well oh if i didn't miss the boost so i've been here trying to pass back to my teammate damn i don't know i don't know how we turned that into a goal we we should not be able to turn these into goals over here it's a really good first touchdown the pre-flip soft touch to myself and around the opponent and then we beat him perfect that's really well done perfect recovery we somehow pull the lead out of this game i have no idea honestly i don't mind how this car feels i i wouldn't like i don't think i'd just use it like seriously but i don't mind how it feels at all for a long car it's actually pretty good i'm usually not a fan of long cars that's unfortunate good demo i don't want to jump for this i'm saying a fake jump kind of make him panic make him think i'm going to be close to making just be annoying and do his job there we go all right good game i'm not sure if i love this car for a long car it's pretty good i guess but if you're comparing it to octane it doesn't even come close to be honest and there's also no customization like if you look at the customization i'm using like the other wheels not the default ones these are default ones but i'm using the other ones um there's like no customization you can use two wheels and you have no paint finishes at all just whatever it gives you it's just it's not that pretty honestly but uh it's okay what can you do anyway hope you guys enjoyed wait there's a decal that makes sense there's a decal i didn't notice but there's still no colors on the decal but it's whatever anyway i hope you guys enjoyed having that wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see us all in the next one love you you
