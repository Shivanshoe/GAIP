one of you guys are the absolute best thank you for all the support on the channel hope you guys enjoyed today's video yo what's up guys so yesterday the llama rama event came out they released the battle bus with this event and if you look you can do challenges and actually unlock the battle bus is how i got it so if you guys are wondering how to get it you gotta complete the challenges um it was pretty quick took not even like i'd say 20 minutes to get it all done uh that's obviously assuming you don't lose any games when you're trying to do it but it's pretty quick and you get yourself the battle bus and games so to start off with the customization of the car you can't change the paint color at all for either side but you can change the paint type you can add any paint finish to it that you want which makes it look pretty cool some of them at least the anodized ones look really nice i think so for each side you can do that but you can also use whatever decal you want so any black market works but it defaults to red and black and blue and black for each side um so the cool thing you can do is find a painted decal like this and i'll add some color to it that's that's probably my go-to when it comes to this car if i'm going to do anything customization wise uh you can't change the wheels at all by the way i think for today i'm gonna use i'm gonna use one of the painted blue ones let's see which ones we can use all right for today i'm gonna use this one because it matches the wheels i think it looks clean you can't change the wheels at all it's default to the battle bus wheels for the boost you can actually use alpha boost which i think is really cool about this car it's not default any boost you can use whatever you want there's no limit to what you can or can't use for hats again you can use whatever you want i even had the alpha hat on here for a bit i think it looks funny but yeah it's pretty much it for hats but yeah and for antennas you only have one option and go explosions of course you can use whatever you want i'm gonna use just atomizer for today probably and that's it and then there's the battle bus engine sound which i think is pretty cool about this i don't know if i have my sound high enough but i'll try to show you guys in training quick when you aerial if you jump it sounds like in fortnight when the the bus is like moving around in the air i don't know if you guys can hear that there's music that plays in that little like horn sound so yeah i think that's pretty cool pretty cool feature that they added but uh we're playing some ranked today i'm not actually super sonic legend i haven't been grinding ranked i've been a little bit busy the last few days with rlcs and just practicing pro play and stuff like that so i'm gonna play some ranked four today i'll be testing this car out in my last two 1v1 placements i have just finished my 3x3 and 2v2 placements i haven't really played much outside of the placements so we'll be trying to get supersonic legends soon but i haven't really been grinding it as hard as i should be i've been playing a lot more just scrims and just chilling and playing tournaments stuff like that so let's get into the last two one go placements and we'll focus on getting super sonic legend in another video obviously but let's get into it see if we get some dubs to a rank we finish off at in 1v1 all right the first game played against someone named secret i don't think i mentioned this yet but if you guys are wondering why there's no profile picture because i'm playing on epic games right now there's been some issues with steam lately ever since the switch the game's been a little bit laggy on steam so switched over to epic games temporarily maybe permanently depends on uh the future how things go in terms of uh steam starting to feel better understand this ball is gonna be close to me here so i should try to slow down and play a bit it's not going to want to challenge me if i full control of the ball here just go for a flick create some more pressure try to make it weird for me the good thing about this this market box is that you can kind of just sit on the floor and win a lot of 50s it's what it feels like at least you don't even have to jump and you'll win a lot of the big 50s just sitting on the floor go for a flippy set here oh we actually saved it it's a bad idea though try to just block them gonna fit this from him i should wait i just turned there try to bait him in a little bit it's a good bait i still have full control of the ball here so we're good we've had to make him play very reactionary a lot of these a lot of these plays so we're still gonna have control after it all the bad thing is he did just get that boost but he can't actually get a go out of it so it's okay as long as i turn away here i don't get bumped it's gonna be fine a half flipped out of the way well there and go for a shot might even be in there we go that was good the half of out of that that was a good flick from him almost caught me challenging that he did catch me challenging it but we recovered well with the half flip there good fake challenge he's gonna have the ball back got his boost which is huge i should go for his other boost here cuz i know he's gonna be low so i could have a crazy amount of options outside of just shooting it i could be able to shoot that maybe i'll go for another shot there we go started him out early he didn't really have an option to break out of his half all he could really do there was just save it off his backboard he's kind of forced to good fake challenge maybe caught him out as well there we go those are really op that's something i've been doing for so many years now and once you do those fake challenges if they commit to your boost just go for the shot save some boost go for the shot you get a free goal all right that's a good touch all i could do there to get out of that situation because he was really close to the ball try to control this let him hit that again i could get a lot of pressure with this i have all the advantage here i'm just gonna toss it up high see what he does i'm gonna fake jump make a panic a little bit more keep on throwing shots on goal that shot could have been better but it's fine because we still it's not him in a weird spot here it's going to be tough to save for us though there we go it's good save it's a good dribble from him you have to wait till the very last moment to save those or even have a chance at saving those patience from us i won the boost which was huge there try to fake the shot i don't think i can get back to this that was a good life for him i ended up missing he rushed a little bit if you have empty now like that just take your time try to take an extra second if you need to dub just over rush i'm gonna go for a cheeky flick here oh my god he saved it it's a good beat that's something i'm used to doing in threes a lot for my teammate if you just beat it off the back wall like that dude this guy's saving everything what the heck there's actually good shots that i'm throwing on i need to save them all i made a mistake here we could catch for him i don't know why i got stuck on the corner like that like in my head i thought he was going to go toward the corner good play from him good defense from him he's playing well gotta wait for his touch here okay he missed i guess i'll pressure this a little bit close i want to save some of my boost here he's probably gonna play this back that's fine you get the boost now that's the big part of that play he's not gonna have a good shot i don't have to panic yet there we go i saw him back off go for air dribble bump maybe how is he saving these dude everything there we go let's get saved good flick from him when they're playing like that like slow forward and have a dribble i know if you're brand new you're not going to see that very often but if they are playing like that you have to just wait for the very last moment to save the flick that was kind of troll for me to even try to go for that i was trying to be cheeky drop it down and get the follow-up i think we've been doing better in terms of offense he's just saving a lot of the stuff we're throwing at him but it's fine try to play this next 10 seconds out smart get ball possession for free by faking i'm gonna fake again there we go should be fun i was a little bit closer than i would have liked at the end but there's a green champ player from last season that i used to play a lot use high mmr probably gonna be super sonic legends soon so quality player you're saving a lot of my shots i don't know what mark could have done in a lot of those shots honestly he was just saving a lot of them we had most of the pressure the whole time he scored off counter attacks majority of his goals i think it was i think both of them were counter attacks so that's just me over aggressing you're getting scored on counter attacks the good thing is it's easy to fix in ones just don't over address too much let's get to the next game might be him again honestly but yeah it was a good game he played the ball on defense for sure uh let's get into the next one so he can keep it up let go let go all right we're playing in someone named feed and we'll figure out our rank after this but so far what i think of this car is uh the height on it makes winning 50s a lot easier like even kickoffs that came off right there i honestly don't think i would have wanted that hard if i was on octane the height feels really good for winning 50 50s and challenges in general that's something that i definitely think has an advantage over other cars um outside of that the one thing that distracts me a lot isn't that the back door opens up when you boost i find that distracting for some reason this guy is alpha boost i wonder who this is it's alpha boost and alpha wheels so it's going to be a solid play just based off of that if you're that committed to the game to have those items probably have a lot of hours good shot not much he could do about that to be honest he has to pre-jump i boost our mind i had ball control these pads he's gonna have a touch here gonna be the weight on that because i could just follow it up and get the boost i'm gonna go for something a little cheeky there we go good ceiling shot okay that's very risky because if you are playing somebody like the guy i played last game who is saving absolutely every single ball you might save that and get a counter attack so you got to be careful you realize that's an option for them they play from us again that's the height on this hitbox actually crazy the height is the biggest advantage to this thing this bounce dribble that touch was actually beautiful really hard to get a perfect touch forward gonna wait for shot i have 30 boosts the shot's not gonna be fast i don't need to panic you hit it over i'm just gonna play to the left oh double flippers on the battle bus oh no i didn't even get i even get the first one i feel like i had it though wait what is that explosion i couldn't even see what it was i'm sure you'll score again sounded loud though just trying to stay close here let's get the boost as well if i can get his boost i'd be huge just to go all the way back now i know i have a lot of time so look how ladies to this challenge i have all the control in the situation just had to go right away but that's fine as long as i flick or jump at all you didn't have way less options on the ball there bumped him off and i got the boost pretty huge not gonna waste my boost though i do have almost full that's fine let me just go back pretty easily should we go for the bump on him there we go i know i couldn't fall off the ball [ __ ] up anymore i toss it toward now just straight for the bump normally you'll see that as an air dribble or something will air dribble with the ball and then just leave it and go for the bump i'll try to do for you guys as an example next but that's a little bit of a different version of it it's just like adapting to the situation a little bit more oh the double reese on the battle bus no dude got nervous too much pressure man too much pressure i've never felt so much pressure in my life not even the world championship honestly i bounced a lot different than i thought it would i probably would have had it i just i guess the wrong bounce i should have played more reactionary than preemptive i messed up my challenge pretty basic dribble from him i should have just played it slower that's all i guess the mr monsoon goal explosion is turning on this for a shot looks like all right i made him back off just by addressing a little bit jesus dude that is the height of this car holy i double jumped and i went over the bar like by a mile get down from him that's the op thing about demos in this game mode you have three whole seconds of a empty net a little bit broken but valid strategy all right i'm uh start going for more normal goals again so i don't throw the lead in the game there we go let's get play good fake jump make him think we're air dribbling they went back down to the ground gotta get shot as well i noticed he doesn't really like the challenge and if he does he goes all in he never really baits first he kind of just sits behind the ball where he goes all in he doesn't really have an in between i should want for this probably yeah so look laggy but that's an air dribble bump what he did there you can't save it there's nothing you can do to save it at that situation i should have either went i would i should have had like more of an in-between where i covered both options because if you give someone enough time to do that get that close to the net normally it's gonna lead to a goal against c to get 50 job to stay on the ball forget his boost is pretty huge here i'm gonna stay on this get the other boost as well he's gonna be really low now let's try to get pads we'll probably see him getting pads in a second get the other boost should be able to here back i still have the boost advantage so even if he has a little bit of a counter there it's not too big of a deal that's why i went for something riskier i'm gonna go for the bump seems like it's play every time you notice tendencies a lot like throughout the game where people do the same thing over and over again right and you'll start to learn by end of the game what they do so you can kind of make a educated guess instead of just like not knowing every time you'll you have more of an idea of what they like to do the challenge you can't out 50 this thing dude go for the bump okay i don't know how i didn't bump him dude that's the thing though i feel like with those bumps they're risky in a way because the game sometimes it's just so laggy like you can't really tell what happens on those bumps even when he got the goal on me this game i feel like i made full contact on that ball let's save oh wait it bounced down no way i thought that was going off backwards that's unlucky bounce for us he's gonna have a dribble now sometimes the game just doesn't bounce your way and that happens but we gotta go out of it should have been probably a free goal for us just bounced up unluckily yeah that was a pro player probably i don't know who it was i think it was somebody with their name changed because they have alpha boost and alpha wheels normally only pro players have that because they commit a lot of their time to the game so they buy these expensive items um but yeah that was a solid game a lot of really weird goals here and there with the air dribble bumps and stuff like that but i hope you guys enjoyed and uh what i can say is the battle bus actually does feel kind of nice i don't think it's something i'm going to switch to full time wait what rank did i get what is it grand champ three are we close to supersonic legend in this grand champ three div one okay we're not we're like 50 mmr away actually pretty close you could probably get supersonic legend at once uh and not too long but yeah hope you guys enjoyed that like i said uh what i will say about the battle bus is it's super high up the 50s are super easy to win um i think that the door in the back is a little bit distracting when it opens up and closes when you're in the air it makes like a horn sound like from the game uh that's a little distracting as well uh outside of that though it is fun to use i think it's a meme car it's like the new merc troll type car but yeah if you guys want to use it to do the challenges it's free anyway you might as well try it uh but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever timeless on your watches make sure you do hit that subscribe button i love y'all i hope you guys enjoyed peace
