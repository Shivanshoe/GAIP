the champ to let's see let's get into the game for today we finished up at champ one day four in the last video we got ourselves two wins in the last video which was really really needed for us because we're on a pretty tough losing streak so hopefully for today we can finish off with that nice little champ two animations popping up in our faces so let's get to the games and let's see how they go all right we're playing against venom and Garth Brooks and both of these guys were really good in the last video and the cousin lover Kenny guy wasn't too great if a monitor percent honest so let's hope he has a really good performance here and I haven't seen not a chicken yet how he plays so we'll see juice is decent as well made this down feel to Juche to Josh shoosh I know his name is cousin lover bang close I might give this ball in off the wall all right that is a little bit risky from honest but it's fine it's like I did get b2 it ever been really scary looking for us definitely I'll touch we're looking for can't lie to you but it's all good I was tough one to get back to you touch it over this dude or what about teammate good control nice play do you don't actually a good idea like that I'm gonna leave that city does nice the one-on-one I'll did so unlucky off the backboard gotta be a little bit closer for a ball like that but it's fun I didn't read the player you know over one you drop my teammates at least me middle there I could feel this give me another one ball game I just hope we come out on top I such a random at least get it's hard to shoot that ball but with a mounting option that's what gonna give for this all it's huge mass is already in their net somebody saved it good job my team it to be there and be ready team I should have this one of them nice play I like the the ideas forming out on my teammates right now this is a good chance really big chance for us you actually read that it's crazy I pass over to him let's go d we're making plays out here we're making passes I brought the depart where I cottage trust my team is a little bit more cuz I know what they're capable of I've seen enough of it I'm trying to pass more like actually directly to them not just stuff off the walls I'm gonna let him go for it that I can back the defender never happens but we need them hold on to this for two minutes now I don't want to shoot that obviously listen go trying to play it up mid none of them are quite ready but it's fine I made one of the pan Achilles nice challenge ago just wanted a really bad spot with a shot you try hard to get - [Music] I'm not gonna go for this yeah I'm gonna let them panic I stretched my teammate I trust them I'll try to pass some other teammate pass across nice you were making plays let's go do let's go this is our champ - game we need this we absolutely need this absolutely let's go huge huge game right here and cousin lover Candy's been coming through top row but looking for my passes they're ready for us what I like to see I was a decent pass back I don't dislike it I just wasn't ready for it trying to fake him to be honest I think my team we're like I didn't even care that I was there and the slightest he almost bought me on the way out I see it the finish Oh finish it off let it off the back and I'll back off now we have 51 seconds to kill pass this off to my teammate on the wall which I'll pass it off the wall again what is the forfeit see what I do good cut out around to a shape middle as well I already get rich on I've no booster I have four actually super convenient no I just fake this fake this fake this again [Music] well no okay we give her again holy shotted I don't want to swear I'm gonna fake it alright good job good job huge huge first game of the video that  brings up the champ to massive we needed that super bad dating I was feeling like we're gonna be forever stuck and shampoo on but we got out we got out baby I'm so happy champ - did one we need this win this next one's huge though - secure chant - because if we lose in the next game I think we drop straight back down to shape one so yeah let's get into the next one hoping gets you back to backs let's go huge game now and really well played from cousin lover Kenny every pass that I said this is why he was finishing off so well done oh no indeed we have some higher right people in here but depends who has a better higher rank first another teeth Oh No oh okay wait I didn't score it no no no hold up hold up hold up hold up that guy supposed to be moving alright chill out chill out chill out that guy's removing that wasn't cool alright so I just hit they're expecting to hit it and then they own gold and I read comments and you know people be saying if there's an own-goal that I don't have to only go to because I didn't directly only also it's like you're chillin you know I mean we're chilly we take those we need those and we take those finish it off let's go baby that's what we need to see that's what we need to see do more of that I'm down for that I'm down for just watching and some other dude is flowing every single shot I'm down for that 100% really good start to the game yet you guys you know I read the comments a lot of you guys told me at school that you don't think it's okay like you don't think it's a bad idea to this own goal because it's not really our fault we didn't intend to score you know when I wait here it is up already someone's up that early best bets almost always going on backboard just because you could defend like pretty much any situation from backboard no real downside to it I know this pika guys good though I played him in grand champ Lobby he's like hi grand champ Lobby so definitely it's tough one here I'm gonna fake this this is the force touch out and then my teammate go next I'll just turn actually because it's not a ball my team's gonna be able to get really easily nice one dark Brook so I like to see the shot bang anything to go big with hits right yeah we needed these two gold buffers and each other solid it's a huge start to this game man when you start off like down early in this series is so hard to come back from but it feels like so difficult but again from backboard like I was talking about on defense guys you can defend pretty much any kind of situation you kind of shot I'm up there better play in middle and then I teammates where there I should just run for off the backboard maybe they would have been more ready a 50 boost back here nice follow-up good job take you over to off the corner good job again I was getting to the higher ranks see people using the wall a lot more that guy's one of the higher ranked players using the wall nicely there but it was a bad touch bad clear that that's only problem if your team is not ready I mean it's not really like fully useful because it was a bad touch but his team moved out on a touch that wasn't good so they have to read the play better there I think this pika dude's got to be champ 3 just 1200 mm are gonna go for this it's fine got the block and follow up your job I'm gonna take the left boost here I fall I don't know business as soon as I get it that way I can make a bunch of suckers in a row if I need to whenever I have time to go for the bollock right here for example if I was able to get that over that guy I can go for any ruble some sort cutter pop it up for my other teammate off that good try you guys straight for the ball do the good thing to try to think about when you're going for challenges to try to attack where the ball is maybe playing threes as first man because if you attack where the ball is then even if they get it over you or around you your teammates can fold it up easily and if they don't do anything then you hit the ball you loose make contact on the challenge and of course doing a fake challenge is really important as well your challenge again I still have that full boost look how much I can do with the ball huh move it downfield I could have got a slippery City got rubber that guy I look at that still on to my full boost I had time to I trust my teammate I was a little bit risky spot we were in but we get nice touch are you mister than ticket miss are we good we're giver chillin gonna hit that let's go for a block all right I'm gonna temporarily go for the abuse and just go back quick and though there's not much boost in our side looks good bang it downfield gonna have a touch here alright I was more toward me I would have had to hit a bump from him Tim it should go for that oh my bad okay so this is an issue that I make a lot just cuz I like high rank habits like him to be in that ball for some reason so I started moving up francilee but you shouldn't really do that if you're trying to play safe don't react to what might happen react to what will or don't react to what might happen would react more so to what could happen so being a spot to react to the absolute worst case scenario which there I wasn't I was longing to spot to react to if it went well for us rather I should have been in a spot to react to the bad 50 or you know what happened exactly there it was a big mistake from me there I'd be myself of course my teammate lost the challenge but again I can position better around that it's not his fault dude if we lose this game I'm gonna be so sad I'm gonna be so so so so so sad please give me a good kickoff here I'm gonna straight back oh no I missed the dish please Darth Brooks yeah and steel let's go all right I'm playing smart defense faking and then going back killing that you got here all right we're good we're good we got the to devastate absolutely that's a lot of points you've got 19 points out of that because that dude was I think champ to be I think I know our team is champ is here wasn't me I was actually unranked both those these are on rank but I think that's chain 3 MMR 12 ponder it it's gotta be I'm div 2 champ 211 what 11 like 60 or something 754 yeah so getting close to champ three you guys getting closer and closer if we give these dogs huge huge video say we needed both of those Rupp the champ to pretty solid and chance to as well like we got chance to give to you so yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night with time minutes when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys all in the
