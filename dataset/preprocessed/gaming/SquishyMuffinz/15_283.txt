you know some guys for today's video I'm gonna be solely queuing some twos we're currently at 2040 MMR which I believe is top 30 is top 25 probably I did not realize it was that high up I thought it was top 50 for sure while we're 24 so that's pretty solid and before we get to the games I just like I said thank you so much for the support on the channel you guys have been absolutely incredible these last few months seriously we're up to 750 K subs now like a little bit over that but you get my point up to 3/4 of a million subs like that's crazy that's just crazy to think about thank you so

hopefully it'll be some good ones let's go alright for the first game we got ourselves camera against Sammy and Kali I'm gonna call kickoff so he knows I'm not sure these guys are but I think this is a Western it is yeah I felt leggy throughout the bet I'm gonna play West much but I wasn't find a game on East decided to queue it up hope we could find something we did unlucky good track my teammate that's my problem with the server though everything feels so delayed never been a fin queue West because of that reason felt bad for West players have to put on these servers all the time it's probably really hard especially against like really good players like an almost yesterday right like that's so like you need but one in made the play I'm just so like it look like they got hit it even on the replay dude he did touch it it turns blue we're absolutely bang it that was a really good past from our teammate found this wall so I passed down to him give him a chance to shoot nice you're positioning for my teammate and I was a good use with space as well we had a lot of space and we use it walk oh my bad my bad mother didn't mean they called it as well okay this is just a really bad server for Wes I think I got bumped again I'm not sure I were good my didn't be able to shoot off this again there we go yeah we're a little bit closer than he was to the second shot and I knew that pretty pretty well that's why we went super aggressively at it he's always gonna have the disadvantage in that situation spawning late I was a good shot so hard to react to you but we're gone with something I saved that even on good ping you want steak over here off I think get rich on confusing game kickoff kickoff wise cuz you both want to go if they come by turn on this I don't mind is Inigo it's fun to make it take for free I got full breeze behind Shanti I killed no so we got 50 bang me me it's fine my whole 100 I could do this especially in threes stay midfield hole into your hundred or whatever happens over the ball ends up is trying to play off of it you have a lot of boosts to follow up your next touch it's like that and then we get ourselves a good opportunity to shoot and we gotta go out of it I was all from holding on to a boost having enough to make that second follow-up such I probably didn't think I had enough to go for that you do in any situation really even it won't be one it's gonna launch your boots just make them think you don't have much you can pull out a big play out of nowhere to me maybe nice bomb I slightly missed a bump I'm glad he went for it as well if he didn't go for the bump there like I might have to decide and even cut it in bad we had all options covered I did it if he decided to wait I had the bump on him for sure he jumps immediately there the guy that goes for there dribble bump get some every single time double fake oh it was so smart but they didn't fall for it the second guy didn't at least the first guy did bomb close teammates playing pretty smart for the most part I wants my boots back you try to see the middle but fall again we first touch actually all that being fast is is just having full boost in a position where you can follow up the ball next so I have the advantage in it every one of those situations because I have so much more boost to use and I'm just in a spot where I don't have to move very far to get to where the balls going to because I'm ready for positioning for where it is so that's all that is what it's all really doing when I'm holding onto the hundred base just trying to wait for my next chance to pounce on a ball but anyway good first thing I must answer next won't even keep it up we got four points for now it's pretty solid not bad at all considering we got a forfeit pretty quickly so it's game so next won't even keep it up legally you all right for the last time we got ourselves a counter again from last game against locust and Nostradamus so see how this goes so the focus on our boost usage again this game yes yeah effective it can be if you're smart with it in twos or any game mode really but obviously you're playing too so you'll see how effective it it can be in this mode for now next time playing threes though that's something that you should really look out for if you're watching anyone that's playing threes just how well they use their boosts any pro player at least that's one thing that separates like the really good players from the okay players there's a boost usage and how smart they are with it you can be very fast and use your boost a lot or you could just save your boosts either either is fine but you have to be smart with it you can you can like speed around the map using your boost a lot that's fine because you're taking big boost as well not a bad thing at all but there's also a lot of players I'd like to just be reserved and hold on to the abuse and that's a really really good skill to have especially for keeping pressure in threes it's a huge huge skill to have makes that super easy I feel now like I saw a 50 boost to speed over to this next space make a play going forward I'm a faker maybe house he can block you got one or two peds and I could just turn my I'm dead you're trying to shot trying to block them also make sure you take your pads like when you're going back and stuff like that make sure you learn the pad patterns helps so much super underrated thing to learn I don't want to abuse you it's fine really fifty go for mid boost my task for that might seem you didn't go to but I should have known you might have went for it it's my fault for not assuming he would probably swore that the undefended backward I wouldn't I got nudged in the air it's all good though kind of hard to know what easy to do or what I'm gonna do either way it's both our faults for not being more aware that situation though I feel like he could see me in front of him and think it's not his ball but might not have seen me know I could also assume you might want to go for it because it's soloqueue and they were passive both our faults really let him go for this just play off this touch save I'm gonna take their briefs I can just read today middle you need a spot to react to it every rocket should I go back which meant to meet the challenge nice laughs this so I pass off to them let's look at the border that that's not that bad I'll fake this guy nice cute 50 I was trying to steal he was he a play that was a really good fake on the first guy we did panic - it took a time I gotta get fifty tip of wall together free goal good finish nice the goals we get sometimes men I mean I'm trying to fit you there like off the left wall just so he goes middle but it goes straight in the best case scenario for sure can't complain about that nice I should've been playing we're back I don't really trust this hit enough both the left wall I'm gonna say middle waiting this bar I kind of react to anything like last time Sam about flicky was trying to stay relevant in a good position to follow up whatever is gonna come from this I have no idea what's gonna come from it see I can do good city patients give that much smarter and doing with that stuff now they don't get Bader Dane too close I keep a good distance they can react whatever is gonna come I'm it that again it's fine so 40 boost even he takes that one it's fine I still have a lot to work with nice patience for my teammate good shadowing you went all the way back didn't give me a chance to flick it over really good try to stay grounded here also a big tip on challenges an issue I see a lot of like lower ranked players making really often when you jump for a challenge don't jump too early jump as close to the ball as possible so you have enough time to react to turn your car according to what they're gonna do just gonna shoot this probably it's like that I have to pre jump he's a whole nother sheet on so I'm trying to cover as many options as possible it's just tough should I hope you put it and play it super well I was so lucky looking another shot I feel like that word right through me but that's just a West savers yeah when you go back see you again like I'm not gonna just jump at that super early because look what I made of you for absolutely nothing and like beat it out of touch I said I go out of it cuz no one's a bit a challenge but I have to do anything and just made him flick it for no reason it would have been fun of a team a wimp but but it's super passive and they gotta get it past but you don't need to like jump early for something like there's no reason to you don't need to panic unnecessarily play up this pass across should be fun nice I see pretty solid game signal is a lot close to about there was a couple goals that probably could have been avoided either way good stuff all around we got we got that one really good goal in the first game a couple other nice goals oh yeah but management is everything made in twos threes ones everything if you're good at banishing a boost you need to do well it's one thing every single person watching us right now can get better at so yeah it's gonna be off for this one guys I hope you enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time is when your watches thank you so much for all the support on this channel I appreciate y'all more than you know seriously you guys are the absolute best I'll see you guys all in the next video I love you all peace you
