yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some twos for today trying to get some more practicing for the upcoming regional that's in two weeks which is very important to make london hopefully we can do well i think if we place well and some other teams lose early on we could definitely make london so we'll see what happens and worst case scenario i'm still proud of the team regardless and we made worlds so that's the big main goal that we're working toward regardless we can hopefully try to win that over in dallas but yeah let's play some twos for today it should be some good ones let's get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got rylai against tristan and jd i'm gonna cheat see what happens gonna be a sweaty game i'm not sure what to expect to be honest i like justin in a while but he's always a solid player whenever i do run into him it's a good beat try to play a shot on that not a bad idea actually really good to kill someone like that like when when that position is given to you like your teammates won't be wanting the other opponent definitely kill the guys just waiting that's like the best time to demo i think you've been in threes if you have two of your teammates like on offense and there's a guy rotating back kill the guy right heading back more often than not he's gonna be the one that needs to help out and if he can't help out then obviously it's gonna be a goal so it does come down to your teammates playing it right but it's definitely the better play to make if you can kill the guys just waiting for what's going to happen out of the altercation between your teammates or in 2v2 just one teammate but same kind of thing applies going for a demo is very useful in those situations for the big touch should get hit from him couldn't reach it it's a good play drop my teammate i tried to jump for it i knew it was gonna be hard for me but sometimes if you just try to go for it even if you miss enough to make the point i think you had it so you might respect the fact that you went for it end up working out actually worked out really well i have free double now wow that should not have worked but it did i'll take it jimmy did not even get the touch you wanted either perfect example of rocket league man people can mess up make mistakes but it'll work out better than what they're intending to do a lot of the time especially in pro games i feel like the mistake is what's gonna work more often than like the perfect play everyone's expecting the perfect thing it feels like try to kill the off the ball guy again like i was talking about go challenge my teammate try to get some boost and just chill in a safe position behind me that's not going to go yet but to the wall maybe it's fine get the back piece let him control this maybe a flick i can follow it if not i'll just wait oh shoot low almost worked outside is like kind of like falling down back wall so shooting low there is a good idea a lot of time good shadowing to get the ball for free which i played around one here there we go so try to make it look like my air drupal was going to be bad by like staying super close to it as soon as i see him jump i used all my boots to get over him and i still have more to dunk the last guy and about half the game left we got early forfeit so that's really solid against the next one keeping keep it up get back to back dubs but regardless good first game even though there was some like sketchy parts to it it's how you adapt to the sketchiness i think that's a lot of what rocket league is adapting to things going wrong so yeah good first games get the next one see me keep it up all right sweaty game again we got jd from the other team and rhylight from our team last game is an opposite with lj who's very solid fellow professional nice that was a really good play i wouldn't sound like i was like really focused on the bump but that's perfect baited him in got one software over him i still had the advantage here so i didn't throw it away i know audrey likes to fake in those situations as do most people and i got a good bump on him at the very end to mess him up you have to wait to the very last moment the challenge i was gonna get bumped earlier anyway so i was well defended from him even if it looked bad it was actually the only thing he could have done because the way i was bumping he's gonna have a touch here maybe even a shot it's gonna be over i'm gonna try to pre-jump if it was on target it wouldn't have been a goal where i blocked so everything was covered there nice good to beat one i'm not gonna be in but maybe i can finish it i actually faked him out he made slaughter they could jump so i'm quick for the second shot because if i was able to get the perfect touch this would be straight in and if not it's still going to be a very uh difficult touch for them to get a good hit on so i don't mind that at all nice good job for my teammate good luck hustle on the bump there that's very smart we're up three goals in a minute i don't have time to play another i don't think so hopefully this doesn't end early i hope they come back a bit i don't know if i have crazy my time right now we'll see trying to fake this one on the wall not the ground fake the bounce and stop the advantage here fake again i had to pop over the last guy that's a good idea good shot golly back here see my phone boost trying to bump me so i just jump early good job a teammate one touch four to be really good let's find around the only dangerous player in that attack only person that can actually shoot it the only thing to worry about there i'm gonna go for left mid because he's gonna want on the way back by gotta watch the bump now yeah he made a little bit of a mistake left being a pretty bad spot but how much i could do to get out of that by the time the situation happens it's really just going to come down to the 1v2 if i get bumped or not and i got bomb we got to get back to this one though if i stay on this myself actually good play teammate's in a bad spot now though he waited a long time to go but it was also ended up being um pretty hard situation for him i feel like after he waited and lj played it really well so you can expect that it's very solid in the situations not really a mistake for my team i'd say it's more just a well-played situation from i'm lj wait for shot wait for shot again i'm gonna hope it's bad i should have pre-jumped i didn't hope it was a really bad shot like super bad or like i have to off the back wall and then i get a free one going kind of playing optimistic there but it's good i wanted them to make a comeback here to be honest i did not want them to end up forfeiting so i i prefer this gonna be more entertaining a watch for you guys a nice shot get popped to myself guess what we said to stay close to it as well and then i have all the power in situation i could just continue to boost into the flip and then if they save it most of the time it's going to hit into me in some way even if it's not straight in it's going to be a goal in the next probably 10 seconds anyway because they use all their boosts to block me teammate can follow it up free shot regardless i dropped my teammate just gonna wait try to shoot this on the ground even if it's not perfect they may both in a panic it's good can bait this now and just go back get behind him we could play actually perfect that hit into him as let me go well maybe trust my teammate here i'll just gonna be rotating out until i get to get hit it's gonna be good gotta get clear out of that as well good shot try i'm gonna wait he has to make a good play here to score this put it in his hands don't make the mistake early trying to watch the pass back honestly you could have scored it i didn't think he would go for the shot like that but i'm gonna fake the whole way here i'm gonna shoot with end we're gonna try we should have this good patience job not to commit earlier that's what he wants you to do click one maybe i'll just wait left still or right at me waiting for the potential cast to come through but he never had a chance to actually go for it but it's good to give your teammate an option i think in situations and twos maybe not so much it's not good to like stick around too long i think you could definitely overcome it but still worked out i think well though i'm saying a thousand points really well i really thought he had it i was trying to play to be on him and it actually worked out better that's my teammate i have to walk myself it's never one more flip out probably just going to stay on it might as well cut it out make him go past left hit off the sidewall my teammate if he wants close take my time i'm gonna pop it over this guy and then just wait i thought my teammate can maybe follow my pop and leave the mid boost but still isn't working out too bad i'm gonna block this can't really score off of it but at least blocking it creates a lot of pressure gotta bump them should be free close nice i played we're nine points off 1k lj left though no chance to get the 1000 but still good games for today i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one thank you so much for the channel as always i
