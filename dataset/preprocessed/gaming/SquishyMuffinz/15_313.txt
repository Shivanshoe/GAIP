brand new video hope you guys enjoy the video for today I appreciate y'all you guys are the absolute best yup guys my last video we finished off at Diamond to Division three at 956 MMR so we're getting closer closer to Diamond three hopefully we get ourselves two wins for today let's get to the games and hopefully you don't accidentally score any more goals let's go alright it's a pretty even Lobby everyone in here is around mid 900mm are not too bad at all I got to ps4 players another team some of the pings a little bit high but outside of that like it pretty even I hit this downfield off the corner she bounced middle see my teammates gonna do nice aerial close here for the demo here got a bump as well I think that's a good play to make as losses I can't really go for the ball go for the player yeah I mean opens up the net if someone's gonna be ready to come in nice pressure I got away back here that guy's closer than me so on defense if you are last back in threes you're trying to kill time for your team credit chance to move forward my team is everybody on me here I'm not gonna go there balls over my head it's my cuter just back off at that point nice size plays forward again I don't want to get a shot on target so trying to play it around them we back here trying to support my team mr. bolter front of me I have vision of both so I don't want to over address on this it's not worth it this guy's gonna go first and there's no reason for me to push forward because my two minutes already rotated out so we could just gather boost and go forward again we need to force a play that is never gonna turn it to anything nice team it should go I think is right about me well I don't go for that okay hit off the backboard that come on as well a little bit a follow-up but is a good try problem is five players are trying to play really passive as well then it's kind of tough for this idea to work out I'll plays off the corner should go middle flick from there my turn it's really far back and go I think he was afk actually plushies up I'm gonna follow up touch gives my team and everyone should get middle what's the other way back here no one's back on my team yet so might as well I'm gonna play this to the right side I'm gonna go again split to the corner because I know that they're gonna have a free ball I don't want that one of my team is playing full time ago Lee seems like I try to go back so that he leaves these games feel very hit-or-miss though in terms of what we're gonna get teammate wise obviously don't know they don't know that I'm not gonna screw up I don't wanna have it in my name I have seen that recommendation in comments but I definitely want that in my name I want it to be organic I was like no problem still trusted mris maker played outfield here nice okay I could put this unlucky fifty-fifty my teammate I was a pullout the corner she might be able to go and I should get past middle way my team strike super past cuz he's lagging so this is gonna be down to bothers teammate being able to score I gotta open up some place here the demo or something like to the side I won't see me that's good I trust my teammate nice he's gonna beat me all right we're good okay put it around - gonna pop this ball up now it's a really far back it's like I'm for the fake she does that's fun so she good round one that's my teammate homework close again are pretty much to be doing that teammates just legging on all the way back in defense hit this down middle turn again play middle again team I should turn yeah it's really for time defense this is so hard I'm a lucky so early hopefully missus come on I wish dude I really do wish just off the backboard my skull would you'd played it off the back there's no one left I see just finish it off nicely done and I bump the last guy that could have saved own ago they could have saved it got to take it out of the play good job all round I was a really tough wonder we're gonna team it can really play for most of it is mostly tv3 but he was he was going for the ball you need to see which is good and that got us up to die made three division too often let's go getting closer closer to champ or 987 m mr-- so 1k isn't exactly diamond 3 huh I thought it was anyway it's and to the next one last the game of the video hopefully we can get ourselves another win and get her something to 1k and alarm let's go alright for the last game we played against to do this on my team in the first game and we got ourselves to console players this time hopefully they're absolutely nuts I'm gonna say defending so he knows to go let's just chill back here I know my teammates I know my teammate from the last game was just good so I have to be careful for him so everyone I'm not gonna go for this one again gonna leave it Tim it's both really far back but good challenge I should be behind them here it's like a fall but ever happens I beat him to it put up the wall oh my god I'll go in okay we're good my worst fears scoring more of those Baxton over 102 mr. let me go there like if I'm still following the ball you're going is gonna do absolutely nothing different than what I would do if anything's gonna make my challenge even worse definitely just trust your teammate in that sense let them go Challenge tight around two of them I don't have a touch here I'll play it middle off that a shot well done indeed really a shot again he was there first let him have a touch first now let's make it tough to go middle you don't want to throw yourself out of the play for a bad 50/50 or figure that's not even gonna be controlled you've no idea where it's gonna go just let them have the touch first play off of it and make a play going forward from there so he knows a good shot to finish it off for my teammate oh all right I was on full I was trying to get a pinch i mistimed it pinch that doesn't go toward the net which is why I kind of hesitated you may close again I really gotta do is plug a defense at this point and defending the threes is all about just choosing the right balls to go before like that balls going to go for cuz I know someone's gonna go I could take one of the play and I said to be over another one's head I get it fast enough here I'm last back for a while so I don't want to over address this well I'll let my team you help me out there we go that was really easily teammates behind me I know I have a safety net if I missed I could just bang one [Music] team it should go I trust you didn't hit this nice the main thing about playing defense histories is just and threes is just about like knowing when your team's gonna be able to help you and if they can't help you try to kill time until they can pretty much it's the main main thing here I'm alone for a long time right so I'm trying to play it in a way that I still have control over the play even if it is dangerous like right there I had to go in front of my goal but I knew that regardless ahead of 50 like I would have the opportunity covered playing patient again lit up middle that's the wall made us off our own corner or a wall to go into other corner me I'll try to display patient I miss it I can't do anything with that ball you're being realistic they're not gonna have a really good shot from that corner like that we go up to the wall here I can't go somebody go back to me missed like take this bump that guy and I can leave now I played before it's done and there's to my teammates already so I don't want to over do my stay there I'm gonna go for this cut out the pass nice get the back love boost as well we go all this done for a minute gotten to give us the ball good job my teammates leave that for me I could take mid boost I just back off here because he's probably gonna have a touch going forward could go for this but I'm gonna play past my teammates up again this is my ball to go for my teammates waiting fight off the corner I'll just leave it there if anything I'm gonna back down to my teammate there's really no danger I could turn again I say my boo so I can get back I still have boots to fall up in the next touch good job put off the corner again let's actually straight in nice I'm gonna go all the way back here just to make sure that we can get any kind of big clear that might come off the backboard it off my teammate he's there as well so I'll wait middle I'm just playing a support they're not rotating back but they don't really meet sir I say back because there's a bunch of chances that are coming through here I'm gonna fake this go for the boost leave for my teammate I got the boost and gave my team the ball as well for doing absolutely nothing there off the backboard give me a suitable chance 10 minutes weren't quite ready but again all you got to do is play faster here we have the game secured this is definitely awkward but I can touch put myself in a spot that was pretty bad there but regardless we got out of it didn't score a goal that's what we needed to do put good defense saw it all around got up to 1k MMR off of that so we get closer and closer the champ ranks we got two diamond three division three pretty solid all around we finish off the video at 1017 MMR and the next one if we do get two wins that should bring us up to champ one which is nuts that means this year is almost done already that's
