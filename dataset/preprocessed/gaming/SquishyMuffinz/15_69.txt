yo what's up guys going to be doing some more of my 2b2 placements for today should be in games let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes [Music] all right we got seven for the first game against roth and abaddon to kick off my teammate go up the wall here for the bump on them it's a good play to start i know i don't have any way to get that over him and go backward because he's going to be on the back wall right if it's going to go like super high he's going to read that probably just sit backwards and be really easy save for him so either just go for the bump there it's actually a really good play to make get behind my teammate here good for the double so slow but it should be enough okay i really thought the guy that was up for it would uh have a touch on it so kind of like messed with my focus a little bit i was really expecting him to get a hit on it and then once he didn't i changed my uh my path a little bit left pass or just a perfect shot oh my my teammates and and twos of the season for the like placements have been actually really good it's a really good shot that's actually perfect super hard for him to stop because the bounce is so good [Music] let him touch this it's fine i should have a free ball actually really good double he's a little booster i know that so i can take it back should be empty i have to block you there just trying to dodge the bump in that guy going for one more bump so i just gotta play inside the net here good job i could just bait this now make him get a panic touch anything that's fine played out right for my teammate play back here pretty ball click one touch to the sky and try to just control good bump he'd have to help his teammate out i'm gonna drop my teammate to be there as well close trying to read his uh his double middle good bump there we go i like to get a little bit close if my team is going for like a double tap like that again lower ranks i don't know how often something that would happen but it's still the idea of trying to read the game and putting yourself in a good position to play off whatever's happening around you right so the same idea i like to play close because there's a good chance that ball is going to be in front of the net they're not going to be able to react to it pretty much a free goal for yourself in the right position right so i like to try to at least be there one more touch there we go nice little control touches to myself round one really good shot all right first game is pretty early forfeit let's get the next one though so you can keep it up get back to back dubs i might play one more depending on how long this next one is but uh yeah let's get into the next one good first game for sure really good start clean stuff clean stuff all right we got seb again let's run it back what's up i recognize pork loot that pork with solid not sure who ebu is but he's probably good as well really good touch from seb wait behind him here in support because he's probably gonna get beat to the ball smarter to stay in a spot where i can react to if he does get beat by it drop my teammate gonna go back again because there was someone that could have turned on that ball right so i just want to be in the best position possible to react to worst case scenario if they do turn on stuff like that unlucky they just got two bumps bumps are very um crucial in uh in twos because obviously you bump one guy to 1v2 for a while right and they bumped him as well so to be zero pretty much about two bumps there should be a scoring opportunity really good first touch that allows us to have so many options right first not just everything there i don't commit for that ball i get the mid boost off of him so he's gonna be stuck on my half if he gets that ball forward it's fine i still get the mid boost and i get my back boost so we get the ball regardless it's pretty much no downside to that scenario at all for us three 1v1 now alpha just again waiting there we go a lot of what uh twos is really you wait for the first guy to make a mistake with the first guy to get a touch that's not so great not so dangerous and then find a way to convert that into a one situation and normally it's gonna be a goal for you so this turn be annoying here actually could have been a goal really close follow up for my teammate i'm gonna turn on this should be annoying hopefully i can get back to that though should be okay nice so we back wall here do you mean it forward touch maybe i actually like that hit a lot from uh there i don't have to do anything there again i like i like just doing that as well if i have a dribble and i know i can't really get past the guy if i just drive with the ball in my car i'm trying to do it again here i'll show you guys being bumped off of it there sadly i'm just gonna drive with the ball in my car here let him hit it off me most of the time you can just follow it up and you get the ball for free yet again so i'll do one more time my teammate gets on my way i'm gonna try to show you guys it's past few teammates there right now there's no downside of doing that because most of the time oh sorry about that trying to bump them most of the time if you do that you're gonna you're gonna get your teammate free ball and you're gonna be able to play off of it pretty easily so i wouldn't worry about um i'll let him shoot it i don't worry about if that ball gets past you as long as you have someone behind you right i just want to show you guys an example of why that's not bad but it's really bad to do if your last man obviously your last man you should be playing that situation differently don't have any boost here be fine though he's gonna get my other boost play right side just to a spot where they can't really follow it up this boot should come back in a second as well with my teammates touch and i'll be back full boost as well should be okay really good patience on that i always talk about this like i feel like every video i mentioned it but i always try to pay attention to like what the threat really is when the ball's coming toward your net there's no threat to stay grounded like you're gonna come off a lot scarier for the opponent to deal with you have to think about so much more than if you just jump right away and you give up your position right away right the longer you stay grounded the longer you can be like a nuisance on defense the better it is i mean this is like a small mistake for my teammate but like he's last man back here insta jumps position's thrown away right away right if he stays grounded the whole time they have no threat on the side wall where they're at he kills like three four more seconds i'm behind him he could challenge so a lot of things a lot of things you can do right but i feel like the second you panic the second you give your position for free like that you're making it so much easier on your opponent just watch any any like pretty good pro player you'll see that an example i'm last time back here why am i going to jump i have no reason to there's no danger in any of these balls jump again don't need to [Music] that's fine force the ball for my teammate oh but he went that's not okay oh good though but again if he's back there if you're a first man going you shouldn't have to ever worry about your teammate like going forward obviously if you're hiring lower ranks i could see that mistake happening quite often but i'm just gonna dive into this nice i like this patient defending this time he's gonna wait i'll shoot once i see he missed because again i don't want to jump for this ball he's up for that there's a chance he could get a read and then i'm out of the play so i'm waiting until i know for sure you missed that point i knew there was a good chance he was missing that regardless but i'm used to there being like pro players that missed the original touch and then read the second and that's what makes it really awkward because if you jump for it and they read that second one unexpectedly it really does mess you up gets you stuck in their half way back here 60 boost chill if he beats him it's fine i'm here for it one touch forward makes him have to panic again right make this don't have to commit teammates to get a free ball nice i don't have the advantage there so i could just fake i know i have him like heartbeat to that if i go for it he has to try to block touchdown where i would be right same thing here i could just play patiently don't really have to do much almost super good shot really good try i'm just gonna say patient here look at when the threat comes right there is no threat i see i can see everyone in the field right now i don't have to do anything but then you see that the stuff my teammates are diving for isn't always the best right and that's what you have to try to work on you're on defense your last man back look at the stuff that you're actually forcing yourself to go for normally not the best if you're lower rank that's probably one of your your bigger mistakes that you're making yeah good second game let's get into the next one we'll play one more because the first game was a really quick forfeit i'm pretty sure so yeah we'll play one more we got a cobalt version of this full explosion alright one more game see how it goes all right for lasting me a bop against anton and cole the kickoff i'd like if he leaves that for me because i'll have i'll just come in on it right but not a bad idea there is a way he can score that it's pretty tough do you see how like when i'm defending patiently you see what it gets me most of the time right i heard another guy go for it as well i can pinch you to be kid i'm gonna fake jump here try to make a panic a little bit picked up again so he has no boost i could literally let him come to my corner the whole way it doesn't matter really it's like showing you guys examples of that and how like your little choices on defense the things you decide to go for really changes the whole game i don't need to really challenge that again i'm going to be in a good spot to get the ball anyway i played over one of them should be really good for my teammate and i grabbed the boost i'm just gonna wait for a touch mid though all right i can pop this up go for some sort of solo play play off the curve try for the down bounce there we go good job from bob to be there you can play to make it beat the first guy and you can pull it up get another good touch really good job my teammate to be there wait all right he left for the boost so this actually is a free goal i try being patient again in like those situations i don't need to rush that ball right just assess what's happening it's a really bad mistake from them he thought his teammate would go straight back or something but this guy should have stayed on the ball maybe he's used to playing threes i don't know it's a weird mistake to make something like that but if i don't wait a second there and i rush it thinking he'll go for it it might actually work out for them good read from him i'm trying to go for something a little bit extra just touching one time to kind of mess him up i couldn't tell my teammate had it so i tried to jump for him it should be fun boost still from them yeah boost starved like this grab these pads right here one two three and grab these and start to push up field if the ball is not here anymore [Music] color land on the ground putting like a scoop on it last second waiting across full boost he wants to use me it's fun notice how like all these balls like when i commit like close like this i'm in a spot where i could still react like the next hit right because i'm gonna challenge like two or three times right there and still stay in position to help my teammate that's what you want to be doing almost at all times especially with you fake right here good fake back from him but again look how much pressure i put it on by not even doing anything good save patience room temperature in that boost i'll grab these pads use these pads to grab the big boost try to beat em here there we go you also try to pay attention to how much of the field you can really use right you don't always have to go for the net you have all the space to the right all the space to the left there's always an option outside of hitting it toward your your opponent you pay attention i'll let him hit this surprisingly you go toward nat see this is the problem too with a lot of like the lower ranks i feel like everyone always instantly goes for that right should have been a pretty easy save for my teammate he just put himself in a bad spot also a tip for if you're my teammate here go back post do not stay near post with the play try to go facing the play on the opposite post it'll make that save super easy whenever i have to worry about it really but um what was i going to say look at that yeah look at the space around the field that you can actually look i have all the space to the right all the space to the left here why am i going to just play the sword then i have no reason to i can go right take this right again if i want to play it down now to my teammate look how many options i really have when i have the ball right i don't have to just go toward the net that's like the most obvious thing to do and sometimes you're playing a good player they might read that you have all that space at the right and left and try to cover it and that's when you can go toward the net and that's when their mind games start to come in you have a lot of options you always have more options than you think you do i think in this game really good pop my teammate wait for shot here i try to keep the ball close there too that situation had it blocked if he doubled good boost still from them i'm gonna grab that pad so i'm gonna have no patches a bit should be good though try to look for the other side i'm gonna drive up and just back off that's it that's my challenge and i'm back super quick look how fast i'm behind my teammate he didn't really challenge well for me though because he left him in a spot where he had full control of the ball and that's not really what you want right the fake here bunch single jump the 50. it could be easy touch for my teammate nice challenge big challenge here make him panic you're fine again playing to the right side look at this face on the right let him hit this doesn't really matter go for the bump in the last guy i made him jump you can fake jump here make him panic a little bit there it is i thought she probably didn't want to get gonna flip on this get a second flip maybe close got the mid boost and i'll just turn in again ten seconds left i don't really have time to come back here but i'll just still starve him i'm uncomfortable look at me not going again like look at the panic that it creates can play into the left side space yeah a lot of little things you can do except like just up your game by a lot right just within these like three games you saw little things on defense not panicking using your space on offense when you have it right you have so many more options than you think you never really need to panic on defense no one's even the best players in the world they're not perfect enough to hit every shot top corner every single time even if they have a solo play they're not going to hit it every single time perfectly you don't have to panic you can chill and i guarantee you whatever rank you're in they're not going to hit every shot perfectly so just chill take your time react to what they have and if you're in the right position on defense you'll save anything it really doesn't matter yeah hope you guys enjoyed
