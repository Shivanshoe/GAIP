a way to give back to you guys everyone 2,000 subscribers from this point and so 1 million subs I'm gonna be doing a signed controller and giveaway so if you guys want to enter those stay tuned on my Instagram and my Twitter links are in the description and the comment section enjoy yoga sup guys in the last video we finished off at champion to division 3 today if we win all of our games might be the day that we reached champ 3 finally if you guys watched the last video you would've saw that we lost our first game with like super difficult camper to use we lost against a champ three player he was playing solid and the site as we got were just impossible to see anything so it was bad that happen I decided that from that point on we would go from random settings to my normal settings and just play with random presets for the rest of the series because there's only like two more ranks left cuz I figured if we're on like these random settings you guys aren't gonna learn anything really and we're gonna be stuck playing against champ 3 he's losing to shape threes over and over again because we just literally have no no way of seeing what they're gonna do no way of reacting because everything just looks weird so it's a de luck with the random number generator settings and obviously like that was the point of the series can we get lucky all the way to green sheet but we lost so we lost our streak never lost a challenge but that's fine we got accepted we made it up to camp to Division 3 not bad at all like I said we're gonna be continuing the rest of the series with the normal settings we're gonna be using another new random car so let's see what I ran of course for Tuesday we got ourselves what is this car called again hotshot oh yeah this is the hotshot with the the Viking yeah alright not too bad not too bad I'm pretty sure this is like a dominant hitbox type car so should it be terrible but yeah we finished off at champ ET Division 3 thank you guys for being understanding by the way of you know the camera setting situation because you guys agree with me like it's so hard to see what's happening and a lot of you guys are saying it was giving me a headache Oh house they give you alive for eating this but thank you so much for understanding guys I appreciate it and yeah I just don't wanna I feel like it's bad content if I can't teach you anything when I'm playing and you guys can't see [ __ ] either it's just like what's happening so it's a good idea like good concept for a series by the same time if it drags on for too long you guys gonna get bored of it so I don't want that so I'm gonna finish up this series and then like I said in the last video we're moving on to the 3v3 solo standard series where only my teammates can score that is literally the series that I can't wait to do because I feel like that one is so much potential and what you guys can learn off of it so that one is one you have to look out for a hundred percent I'm not sure if I'll start the directly after the series or not we'll figure that out I'm thinking maybe I'll do the series and then take a little bit of a break and then get into that one but we'll see if you guys really really want this one immediately after we'll figure it out and we'll do it immediately after then but we'll see let's get into the game so for today hopefully we get into champ 3 get closer close to the grand [ __ ] let's go this guy's at the 12 16 mm our hole he's being dryden I think we played this guy in a previous video pretty sure I recognize the name he's trying to date it's up to chip 3 good for him nice flick there we go we have normal studies now there I think it was the day we lost to you I think this was the Jimmy laughs to you to be honest not sure it was doing this flick thingy alright well see how we deal with normal setting said I said we lost him they feared normal settings you probably probably beat him so see that's true I'd hope so but he is solid that you could tell he's gotta get mechanics he doesn't play ones right well trying to make a panic here doing weird spots somehow that bump me and that didn't kill him what are we selling for control over the Boyar I was really banning too dangerous missed the boost I'll go for the flick and there we go do you like for example if I had settings where my FOP was super close there's no possible way I see that he misses the boost there I'm just gonna be dribbling in that ball not knowing yeah I mean that's why the settings are reported it gives you understanding what's happening on the field if you have settings that show you everything of course I'll tell you what I have a good mixture being able to see what's happening on the field but also being able to see how your car's gonna hit the ball so you want to look for in your camera settings and there is no right or wrong camera settings but settings that are super close and gives you no field of view of what's happening around you you are the closest thing to wrong settings kind of want to avoid those but outside of that there really is no wrong setting whatever feels good to you yeah this guy you could tell like his play style is super one space just because tensor this like trying to trap the ball every single time he is he was control whereas when you play somebody plays a lot of twos or threes whenever they have time with a ball they tend to throw it away every single time but like a once player who plays a lot of it you can see the tendencies and the things they do differently we start paying more attention so we don't lose this try to give you guys more tips this racial like this is to come to me so I'll try to just play the low 50 he wasted his boots and you racist positions just to go back for a boost here trying to swing wide for a shot Sudi does don't know the shot on goal this port is even lower boost in this piece of pop back go put it to the wall take a beat them try to stay with another shot here and there we go make sure of denying on the boost and also staying with the ball keeping the ball in positions where I can still follow it up add filling it turn on that suffered ball fish I'm gonna go for the ball you again but a fake going for the ball and good for the boost again trying to try to starve them without the wall he has none yet at all so I full control in a situation I can go for a shot finish it off once is all about boost control man prettier put in a spot were there they're just hungry for boost and they make a bad touch you gotta force him to make that bad touch he loves those flicks like a golfer somebody reads to figure out every time I haven't by someone who reads figure out this much so we never come to me here I shut Popham high shot I forged it in Hill at the backboard excuse me control of another touch here pop it up once Sooni jumps and pop it again actually wait it's super long I was good of him patient somehow I got bumped off the wall I've no idea but I get some ago totally that [ __ ] the puck me off the wall is so weird what like I should I should I got a bump like back toward my half not upward so he reads a pick you up every time so we're gonna go somehow I must look with a stick I'm actually curious mr. booth so my cue to go in for that boost try to bump him as well gonna flick here I'm gonna go for the other piece here I have bump that's fine go for a little boost it's save go further boost sticking pads so I've control slowed the ball trying to shoot that there we go again over and over again just take a shot take it pass I'm trying to anything like super crazy so I want to be able to play like in a way that's that's like matchable yeah I mean like any rake any rate could just take moose and take shots yeah I mean that's what I'm trying to play like you guys an informative review of how to play said or just clipping on them every time going for something stupid you didn't go for that probably okay eat fake challenge I'm staying with regarding some shadowing his touch so if he does get it I could follow up the next and I still have full control over it I'll go for flip your city should be in off the dunk a little bit lucky that I got the dunk well I'll take it under percent I always tried to block him obviously but like fact that he goes [ __ ] and there's obviously lucky part kickoff was bad there see he flipped with his butt into the ball so I feel off like he did let's see what happens party's gonna die we're both in the same thing yeah kind of just dies no booster he's trying to go a stove or a messed up it should be game missile back with the finished it off there we go yeah you saw it though for sure definitely definitely to reach the log - I've seen and once but you could tell IDs like grand chip in twos and threes 100% the way useful in solid with chemically it's pretty good defense as well yeah we got up the champ three off of that by beating the champ three up the champ three div one let's play like two more one or two more games for today hopefully we keep on winning so we get to two grand champ in no time I'm still sad that we lost our harder percent streak man I'm so sad but let's keep it up let's go we're planning it's the same guy again hmm give me another another close game hottest evening a figuring out better though if you find yourself playing as the same opponent over and over again trying to char learn how they play and if you if you are struggling with them as well then look at where you're going wrong look at where you're making your mistakes the most and what they're doing to capitalize on it to do it again the way pretty easy as balls already go into our left boost just try to take left base from them just shootable it's just hard to shoot I'll try to stay with it's fine' that got killed if I just wanted to get side probably the worst side this one just has a baited awkward you think mid boost though you and I might didn't spawn probably just spawned yet oh quickly if I can expect I have no boost but does it matter I'm still threatening and attacks he's gonna have to play on the defensive force the flick play up the wall he's gonna have this in the wall here so I wait for his touch control nice and easy keeping the corner always trying to keep these awkward situations in the corner like this cuz where's good scenario they go for and you have control full controls though it's that did nothing thereby forced me to a spot where i trolled why did i troll i was saying I forced him to a spot where it kind of made him make a mistake and I have to do anything for it I hadn't had to put myself in a bad spot I just had to sit there and let him make the mistake but then I went for some cheeky finishing and I missed we got a gold of it stuff we stayed on it when hit the cellar wall hit it around him he wasted his boost and this recover all the way back here so I'll go for a double tap product it'd be on the backboard quite yet oh I can't get back just rolling the ball bounced down in a way that I didn't read it and he also didn't read it but that kind of sucked because I was hoping that he would hit it and I'd block his touch so it's one of those situations where if he misses I miss my Miss he makes this type thing and normally defense gets the best of this and won't we want at least in to be to the defender misses and the attacker misses as well then there's a follow up and it's normally a goal against but and once normally favors a defender who misses see I go for a flick here I'm sure to bump them each other double jump for that I'm gonna take his boost here again cuz why I'm going to leave that Boosh room and give him enough boosts in a position to defend as well there's no point and I made it awkward he's gonna have to go back here get a bad touch than retreat probably if anything didn't try to take that back to his boots most likely suited does panicking I'm gonna take the other corner as well here ah nevermind there's no point I just faked him I want to go for a second fake but he was driving too slow he would have ready you never more boost the buck he go I like thinking off because I still have boost to get back to the next piece somehow I didn't get that one it's why the cutoff is good trying to kill him think I have the boost as well might hit him with a fake bump on your mom I'm just gonna bump him I guess I was gonna go ahead of the ball and the backup ball's gonna go over me it's 200 IQ but he just went in for the challenge so I ended up bumping him someone's reading you're faking off every time like that turn a challenge instantly so I have time to flick you can get free go a little bit it's a nice little little trick for free goals here and there there obviously are a lot of ways that they can counter that but get you free goals I also like to do that as well sometimes it's going for the demo1 spots like that because it does give you a free ball should be fine I'm just gonna pop this city does nothing crazy it's fine you kill gonna have control now this smart gonna going for it here we go I have to do anything crazy there either the ball was on the ground I just drive into it I still full focus on my position in my car I'm not throwing myself away I still control the ball as well there's no there's no downside to doing that in that position with the balls on the ground that's pretty solid you game all robbery division down to Division two so we'll play one one more game and then next video we'll probably play all the games to get us a grand champ if we win all of them of course so into the last game of the video and see if we can get another dope let's go we've literally played the same guy three games in a row for this video I can't believe hey the exact same guy so if we beat him we'll be up to over 1200 mm or in a fake charge then go that's just shoddy I'm telling you I can't get the shot but get some pads here should be able to beat him that still gives me full control of play kind of mind for his boost but that would mean that he also gets the ball I don't really want to be that could probably wait a sec you on air mine I was in a bounce higher dozen to go up the lip I've been safe but it's actually a good bounce for him all right so I get to the side I doesn't want to get dunked anymore so that's what I mean that that is like a way around what I was doing obviously there we go nice little recovery there off the ceiling yeah because I've been faking it and then immediately going for the dunk he's uh trying to change his place that was just good I like that he's adapting starting to adapt after the third game tapas up once just surround him maybe good block I grabbed like four pads here they're not being a position to try to challenge I flicked instalay today was the first time he just instantly flicked the ball so you could tell he try to switch up his game a lot we haven't played I think three games against each other now first time I was on the dump setting so this is the guy I lost to and the next tail is on my normal so you tried to adapt down play which is good so you want to see I'm not playing like a hundred percent like I would run be playing it's a high ranking ship try to like slow myself down a bit but he's still doing well to adapt to try to adapt knows a good power shot you could tell he has he has all the fundamentals of a good once player so he's good in that regard his defense key some work though for sure you didn't eat this challenge is really really aggressively sometimes like to aggressively hit it around gonna get he went for like three balls in a row now they probably should have waited on some small one for another one there waited on that one you got the bish there so he ultimately won that battle which is no guarantee you're gonna look out your window like that if you're challenging every single ball challenged again there there's just the balls that he chooses to go for and good in a position like that I'm gonna I'm in a much better spot at the bowl away and then you are to shoot on my net so like I would say come close go for the fake challenge and then like back off don't don't go all in for that a suti does here probably off the counter there we go you're not gonna say in front of your ear dribbles there too like you can get a pretty easy counter-attack off of it I can tell you messed up his first touch there we go we've hit him with too many mind Games's now there are now mine games on my games the kickoff the saves boost won't come back in time he's gonna get it most likely you just got it I'm pretty sure I didn't I was actually really good for us this around the corner first and then go down finish it off I know I can't get a shot straight off of it but that's the fastest way to convert that into a ghoul and in twos it's also the best play there there's nobody back hit that middle quick let it seem a have it get his boost here other boost now this fish as well to do those with that should control this you shouldn't this away good the way in the bouncy he's flicking instantly now he thinks I'm gonna go every time I save my business what are using like five boots had time to save this you know that you shot so it really touched me to hard on defense because I'm playing patiently on them I just really know what the DCO for bumps did fifty honestly I'm trying to bump him there just didn't pay off there we go good challenges good see you two challenges we really give them too many opportunities they're trying to save like half of this year I kick off our kid we can get back to the corner before him see if I can pinch this I think it's wider a little bit yeah unlucky alright cheeky saving coming I got stuck on the inside of us do it again to for to know [Laughter] [Music] that'll be kind of nice no my uncle all right we can't lose this only have one going down one goal buffer it'd be sad if you lost I missed the Beast I don't wanna get too aggressive you there because this cuz it's a goal against me yeah we're good that we're here we're good she can go up for us nice Judy that's here we could put off of his touches now he'll let him make the mistake she she's gonna force so he pushes it away from me I didn't actually go outside of Eagle stop driving close there and the event that you just banged it off the wall I get to the next touch first regardless and then if he does it I can stop right there and get a free goal so there is no downside to it really are you staying close to no boost he loves those little flicks Minh does it every time a gerbil bolt you're just gonna go Oh No uh trolley do actually okay I don't know man when I did these series I just can't I can't find that like serious part of me take these like super super series I water you I think it'll be easier for the three three series that's my corner I don't think go get their time should be down every good calculator that my brain yeah that's uh the last game of the video over with four down we'll be back in the next one to possibly get grant shampoo who win all of our games but I think that should put us into the vision to or Division three off of that we got the vision three opposite so yeah it's like two or three games the next one we should reach branch here pretty solid all-round hope you guys enjoyed yeah I already almost done this year that's nuts gone through it so quick yeah be hasn't been enjoying I appreciate you off all the support he hasn't been absolutely insane as always I'll see you guys all in the next one like comment subscribe love y'all
