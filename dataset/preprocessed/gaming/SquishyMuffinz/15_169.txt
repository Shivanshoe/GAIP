notified when i upload a brand new video thank you guys for all the support and enjoy today's video yo what's up guys gonna be playing some twos for today with my old teammate torment i know a lot of you guys probably remember when we used to play together all the time so a little bit of a trip down memory lane but it should be a lot of fun let's get straight into the games for today see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a sweaty game here we got first killer and unrusting i don't know who that is but they're cute together so it's one of his friends so gonna be somebody good yeah i'm not sure exactly who that is though did you have a free ball here for a second number one so i get over the other one too hard for him to save put it in too much of an awkward spot i was gonna try to go for the bump right but get a touch before i go for the bump that way it kind of messes him up and he has to reposition for the extra touch um so i tried to go for there actually didn't get the bump properly but it was enough definitely to mess them up low 50 here i'm gonna save 50 boost and still be middle if he wants to use me i kind of hope he doesn't because i can't turn and get a good shot of this so i'd rather him solo play it's a good challenge from us really good win got the mid boost as well which is kind of huge because i can recover off of it first loves it's a challenge last back here i don't know that so i'm gonna try to go for a early flick or early outplay attempt get around them it's fine bump doesn't do a whole lot there still have a lot of boost it's not in the threatening spot where they can follow it up and get to go immediately so i don't mind it take the bishop here that's what he wants take away boost from someone like first killer who just loves to hold down boost is a huge counter for sure because he loves just holding down boost when he can right so he's gonna be low here as well because he missed that other boost good kill from torment and i got that one let him go for this that's fine first going to go as well just go back here with a beat nice as long as trying to get the touch here we're good that's a good touch room as well i'm waiting for the bounce here close tried to go for the pop over i'm not a bad yeah tom's gonna bang this most likely oh my gosh what a safe first he's actually ready for me to shoot that perfectly what the heck actually really surprised me that he's ready he has a good shot from us very surprising he's a very good defender so i don't i don't act too surprised because something that he's definitely capable of plays off to the left i want to play into his fire you can follow it's fine might not be fine now yeah so i should have taken that solo i don't know i still have too much of a team play mentality even in 2e2 and i think a lot of the times in twos you got to just send it play selfish play solo and it'll benefit you more than passing a lot of time so i passed there and i left him in 1v1 because i thought he'd be there for it it's kind of a annoying thing about twos let him go for that's fine i could take this back boost now first going for the bump on me it's actually really good for us though it's gonna be a little boost you always see it all bumping me now i can get a pass across off the pass maybe a shot maybe a goal you could say from then that's a 1v1 now it's awkward i storm i did that nine times out of ten he's gonna get that if i hit it over him good boost still from them kind of makes keeping pressure a little bit tough around us what a catch what he just perfectly lands on that and catches it not for sure i was going to fall in front of the goal did i save my boost here i can make a play with this back off go for the 50 instead there we go don't either just throw that away and hit it off the back wall right especially when you have someone like first killer on the back wall on their team just going to boom their way that's going to be free possession for them might as well play that into a 50 50 bull position try to win the challenge it's a really good 50 for us go straight back to cause it won't be one now it's gonna be really good it's creates a lot of opportunities for us right so i could turn around get a pass across here he's gonna have time to get to that ball make something out of it couldn't quite reach but it's fine because i can go back to the wall here he knows i'm going to be here you should leave this first loves to fake though so i didn't bother even looking at him i just went for the ball good popping first as well thomas should follow this i have 30 boosts but it shouldn't be threatening at least not yet we're in the wall with 12 here play that one forward again he's going to dribble this and i can't help out tour here so it's going to be on him to not get bumped at least terribly all right we're good he beat him to that as well i didn't think he'd go [ __ ] away there somehow getting away with this situation but we will definitely take it go for the 50. ran out of boost it's fine we blocked the most important angle to block there forces it high to my teammate fake this try to make a panic should be right to torment again retouch nice i went off the top just in case you can get there over one try to fit the other one the torment in a decent position if i can go from again best case scenario there we go the bump there forces first to jump early right you don't want to give a 1v1 player in that situation time definitely the best thing we could have done there let's force the the play early should be my ball to go for next hit it around to me fun rotate shut away for the mid moves i don't want to stay too long in the corner and that's getting us scored on because of it so i want to be able to rotate back get behind the ball get in a position where i can challenge there we go i think we just took down the number one ranked 2b2 player right now he was number one i think when i had checked let's go take a look he's playing with a friend though um who's also very high ranks normally supersonic legend let me see who was who he's playing with i could tell you guys i go you players games he's playing with money so money is a um pretty high ranked players normally ssl very high up there first killer was number one he is now number three so he lost probably like 18 points off of that we gained quite a bit we went up to 20 30 off that so we're almost in a top 10. um but yeah good win for us for sure let's get into another one it's probably gonna be him again it's gonna be another sweaty game and uh see if we can win again see how it goes all right we got the exact same matchup as i predicted because they're definitely the highest ranked players on right now closest to us because we're number 11-ish and versus number three obviously so definitely the highest ranked players on for the surrounding and awkward spot let first waste all this boost should be okay play to the side grab it through this block because first going to be going for it put it off the wall someone should have a free save here free ball even though the shot looks threatening right you have someone sitting in goal especially someone who's played as long as tormund has defended as many things as tormund has tried to pass that didn't work but um yeah it's definitely not going to work that often against a very good defender going for obvious shot like that very surprised extremely surprised that he just went for the the challenge there but noted now i know that i could have went for that quickly and beat him to it you really shouldn't be going for that ball that he went for there the last man but that's something a lot of people in na especially like na2s go for um it's quite risky though i think because it leaves a lot open right if someone goes quick to that ball he just did it again in a very risky situation but actually might pay off if someone just like goes for it quickly another team they're going to beat that almost every single time like i would say like nine out of 10 times if someone goes quick to that ball they're going to beat you the whole idea of why that works is because it catches them off guard so i guess you could argue that it is good because it does catch people off guard but at the same time you want to try to like get rid of the risk of a challenge like that as much as possible if you can be in a better position put a next touch rather than take a risk that might get you a goal but might also you scored on you gotta like kind of like weigh your options you know if someone's gonna get you scored on more often then it'll get you a goal probably don't do that thing i'm gonna have another touch here it blocked from us someone should have don't think i slaughtered it just enough but see if you can get it there we go it's a kind of awkward angle for me to get a good shot on the empty net there i knew it was empty the main goal is getting on their side of the field as quick as possible tormund's landing forward i see him there so kind of gives us that option right not a terrible challenge for us not great either though i was really good positioning though to be there for the ball it's just going to spill right back out to us we knew it was going to be awkward for them storm is coming in there and all i can really do is go toward our net so i was trying to cover at least our goal there i know it's not going to go high above me it's always going to be a low 50 in that situation so it's covering a pretty good spot to be tough for tour though yeah those are the spots that obviously first loves to be in just one for kickoff tommy can't do anything he cheated so you have to go back but you don't kick off there obviously if the ball goes toward him you have to just go back for the other boost it's not on torment it's a tough position to be in a very good shot from us though to capitalize again on a risky challenge like this it's the same guy every time he's going for the risky challenges and it's a thing that can work if i take my time it's going to work he's going to beat me to that ball it's going to end up in our side and we'll be in a very dangerous situation because i would have flipped into their side right but there's that risk factor to it that he's not taking into account first go to turn for boost and that's going to be a goal and that might even secure the game i'm not sure if they're going to leave but that's a good goal to get us to secure a three goal lead here again against the number one ranked two player it wasn't the normal rank two player i played like three times tonight we beat him every time i actually dethroned him so we beat him here again it's uh the nail in the coffin for sure i think again last man challenge very risky there i'm 40 boost but it's fine we could just fake that ball maybe it's okay to hit that middle quick but again there's that risk aspect to it it's a good password i can't do anything about this very good shot nothing you can do in a situation that was very smart from him though so that was the one time he didn't into challenges last man i played it to a pretty okay situation like they couldn't get a good shot of it but he passed it well and first killer shot as good as you can shoot it shot like that you're not saving unless you're backboard if i had boost potentially i saved that but and then it's always gonna be a tough tough one to stop i'm gonna go for this gonna be here trying to get in the way so it's fine i could just block it i'll be back well as well see what torment does here that's a good 1v1 killed like at least six seconds here i'm leaving mid booster tour that go for this ball off of that popping up high there kind of just kills a lot of their options they don't have much to do except hit it across and beat one play definitely uh a good thing to do there when you can huge pinch for us very smart pinch as well going to be in a very awkward spot now off that i've played around one let me go one more time here pop it up for torment he wants to go for this and i'm last back this is what i was talking about his position where it gets really awkward and you have to play it smart and i think i played it pretty well there but if i die if i dive right away there there's always going to be that risk factor of they just beat me and it goes straight into my net right she always had to be worried of that i always gotta at least have a little bit of a worry that can happen i'm trying to play that in a smart way where it doesn't leave tormund in a terrible position after the fact it's a good challenge for us torment has to not mess up the touch and we're chilling be behind the challenge is good because again versus is a once player you don't want to leave him in a woman situation so if i can in any way stop him from making a play there it's gonna be the best case scenario laid off the wall could have actually scored it but it's fine hit that off the wall again again here can't follow this up but should be okay follow this one up now try to stay on this ball probably should have this forward boost never came back though the heck i thought that boost would have been there again he's challenging last back in a very very risky situation i'm just gonna i should have done the same thing honestly back to him but i have that in my head to play safe that's last back which is a smart thing to do especially in the 3-3 environment you don't want to be throwing yourself away last back every single time because more often than not it's going to go badly against very good players who can spot that out right good wins very good wins for us today two wins against obviously many would consider the best ubc player in the world one of the best one-on-one players in the world as well and uh a very good threes player as well and first killer but uh fun games all around hope you guys enjoyed a little throwback a bunch of games with torment here the xc9 boys still got it longest thing to do in the game we were at least um we're together and uh yeah definitely still got it got the camera a lot of fun and uh money on rusting he is a grand champion right now but he is always a supersonic legend like always top 15 always top 20 on leaderboards uh he plays a lot of rank a lot of ranked probably just haven't played much twos this season but that's why i first first wouldn't play with someone who's not uh not that high up yeah we ended up finishing off at the number 10 spot by the way and we ended up taking like 30 or 40 points off of first killer which is kind of crazy we got him single-handedly out of that number one spot so uh yeah not a bad day's work at all hope you guys enjoyed that top 10 secured in 2v2 we're up to number five we dropped back down from normal we lost one game yesterday we lost 15 points from one game because we were kind of trolling a little bit but uh yeah we lost the 15 points we lost the number one spot in 3v3 but we're number 10 in 2v2 i could probably go for like top 10 and when we went as well i put the time into it but i haven't been playing it as much as i should be but uh yeah number 10 and twos and number five and three is not bad at all so far for the season but uh yeah keep grinding let's see what we can do in the future yeah it's gonna be awesome guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever happens when you guys may be watching this like comment and make sure you subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
