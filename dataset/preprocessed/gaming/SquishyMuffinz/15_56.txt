yo what's up guys gonna be playing some two today with aqua is an upcoming player super super good very young as well a lot of potential there should be some fun games let's get into let's have some fun all right planets evo and jasper here my first match aqua's afk but it's fine it's good block my time on the ball here played over one shot about maybe nice good job gonna go for a bump like that if you put into the corner nice and soft it's almost always best to look for a bump you're just driving past the ball makes it so much harder on them that guy was waiting on whoever's behind him to go for it and he couldn't so that's like my cue kind of to go for that bump and that's the new aqua free goal every time and it's pretty hard to miss that we lost back for a bit here and i mean chased definitely a very hard situation to get out of it's just unfortunate got stuck in a spot like that no real way for me to like hop over that defender and get to the save very hard it's gonna bump me no matter what i do there really unfortunately kind of just a classic 2v2e type of goal actually could have placed that in score probably i didn't realize i'd leave the net up in though trying to beat one that i didn't have to actually beat interesting just waiting for touches let him hit that doesn't really matter let him hit it again too for a bump i thought about him has all been huge even going from up right there i feel like that just forces so much pressure it's good block i don't watch shot though nice good from aqua should be open oh my gosh actually almost scored that i was like an impossible angle i don't know why i went for a shot i surprised myself almost being able to score that number one let him hit this it's fine doesn't matter he's not going to score off this at most he's trying to just delay time so i'll have to actually dive it's fine again just trying to delay time awkward knows plays it pretty well there's a patient trying to go for a bump that bumper got us a goal pretty much na2s is like super super bump heavy it's kind of like something you have to do if you're playing like super high level twos now but threes isn't exactly the same way of playing so like if you are trying to get better at threes i wouldn't i wouldn't try to copy your like two's play style into threes because it's not gonna work that well cuz the bumping stuff is good but it's all in you know moderation like you have to do at the right times in threes and twos you can kind of just go for it whenever and it'll work out it's a really good bump the block to follow unfortunately aqua got beat but again that last guy going there if rocco just wins that challenge it's a free goal for us actually a better situation for us than it is for them but aqua just didn't get out of it [Music] it's fun got no shot you're trying to play it around nice trying to follow this maybe even a shot off this it's a good block attachment maybe a shot close wasn't close close enough just quite yet close control to myself it's actually gonna work yeah the soft touches are working so good there everything that i did was like just out of the reach just unexpected enough for it to work i think that i don't have boost midair and then keep boosting after big bump i play this middle you should be here close big block let him hit this as well it doesn't really matter if i can kill him as well it's even better wait for his touch to the right make this first hit this should give me some space off just a little bit of fake there bump would have been huge on the second guy it's gonna pre-jump it's fine all you can really do is hit this away or pass mid and it should be blocked either way let me hit this should be too aqua anyway both commit on this now so this guy doesn't have any play aqua should go for me though still nice if your bounce fake hit control a little bit played over one both awkward should be a goal rock however goes nice good job that's another good play to slow down the situation put them in a really awkward spot take advantage of it i'm gonna tell him that i'm faking hopefully he knows okay ah try to see if i can pick the pass back and then go for like a low shot but didn't quite work nice remarkable i thought we got scored on so i kind of want to scratch my nose i'm going to instagram here when he flicks me okay he likes to flick through the corners a lot so i have no reason to go next time if i know that his main goals are just to hit it around yeah that's pretty that's pretty obvious situation there that i threw myself away and i don't need to throw myself away someone's doing that a lot like you've seen the chain to the corner they'll just drive up and back off after because their play will be made but you don't give up your position for it like better in every way should be a goal still maybe close fake the first touch again to gain some space click now let him hit this i really like the awkward touch today so i kind of move forward early good block at least i like really do with my boost there wait it's up still what no it's okay that's a good try in the past i like it can actually follow that let's let him hit it away yeah same situation right you're just trying to hit it around us at the corner and i'll do a good job to adapt already huge really good 50 not the best shot but good idea i think he went for a double when he missed time this jump he's faking this i mean a little bit too obvious i knew he misses i have not should be fine still awkward time to boom back good demo i'm dead back which is okay honestly puts me back in a good spot if aqua gets flicked or beat should be okay shouldn't be bad for us i don't think nice actually really good uh adaptation like little there's little things that we did throughout that game that was like really good to make up for what they were doing and how they wanted to play out the match really good first game all right let's get into the next one seem to keep it up get back to back dubs see if we can uh keep it going we're doing really good lately all right we got skills and next t for the last game see we can do here unfortunately i should make it back maybe no i can't unfortunate that's all in the in the bounce here if the bounce is good in the corner it's fine but aqua got beat pretty hard on the cheat it's never gonna be able to be saved unless the bounce is good for us then it's really all just reliant on the bounce should i have one more here all good round one should be a goal maybe there's a lot of time on a double nice really good pass to take our time there you know we get it around one by passing that and we know the other guy's gonna be in a bad spot we can't challenge so always gonna be a better pass to make there something that a lot of players actually look for is past like that so they got something that every player could do more myself included sorry i was yawning wow actually worked out beautifully a shot i went super high up took my time and like chose where to place it under him i like that a lot any boost thing he wants back left right side maybe really it passes a goal too just well played from the defense prefer flip should be fine all i do was block it my only job there played around him off the wall maybe a huge fake actually like that close actually it would have been a goal it was on target i'm just going to leave that for aqua now go all the way back save my boost here maybe 1v1 for a second huge win maybe even a goal if you can land on it close i was turning it again that's fine a little bit a little bit uh too aggressive i think but it's okay it's not the biggest deal really good save good time on the challenge they love to do that too and twos like they have some guy just trying to get in the way on the way back even if it looks weird the smart play to make they just try to throw yourself at the dribble to get in the way like that he's about to do it again right he's diving in front first teammate but he didn't actually dispossess him at all like he didn't get him to lose control of the ball so still really awkward in the last man that's why first man such an important role because like you don't want to leave your last man in a bad situation you want to always make it so as easy as possible for them to get touching the ball right such a hard thing to like do well i feel like like this situation it's fine he goes for me and should be okay regardless i have some time to deal with it but if it gets a little bit too close to the net before a challenge can actually come through that's when it's really awkward it's really tough to deal with a lot of the time especially in threes everything's so fast there's a lot of like moving parts to a play one little mistake or one miss time challenge kind of throws everything off might be bad it's not the best touch works though [Music] that's a crazy flick oh my god my first touch it's a good bait i don't give up my position really i'm still back with full boost and aqua is a bit of a challenge i think it's a win-win it's probably gonna go up the wall with this fine big demo aqua wins that's the goal probably um lucky spawn same side kind of an rng thing i was looking up for something crazy i decided to stall once awkward died now we're trying to go for a goal and giving up 1v1 will be two if you just left that maybe i could have shot but okay i don't think he knew i was that it's not a close though i mean these are these are good players for sure you know how to play this mode you have to play really solid you can't give up any easy mistakes really it's really good we're getting like one of these per video lately like one really good cross map goal flip reset can't really do anything about that again that situation the reason why it's hard is because they don't have a first minute challenge it's pretty much a 1v1 there that's just taking advantage of them positioning badly pretty much also playing it pretty perfectly um the mechanical aspect of things it's a really good shot there as well good pass from wacko really good job to look for the past and there we go it's in the office today's video guys sorry it's a little bit short a little bit short on time but i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself one for the day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment and
