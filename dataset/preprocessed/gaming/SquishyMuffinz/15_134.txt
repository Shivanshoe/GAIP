yo what's up guys today we're here with gyro going to be dual queueing with him for today i don't think we can get anybody else if someone decides to join after the first game maybe we'll play the second one with someone but if not we'll just do a cue both games for today we'll be trying to get supersonic legend in threes we're super close we are grand champ three division four right now for 1856 mmr i think we need 1875. so if we win both potentially we'll reach it we'll see let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves pdog and our team against uh don evo and hd sparky jr i recognize who evo is not sure who p-dog or sparky are everyone in here probably probably is pretty good if i had to guess because this was found pretty quick and i'm pretty high mm right now i think i'm like top 20 right now not many people are ssl yeah there's like 10 ssls i think so far in threes gonna be a tough one to stop going for a bump on me so i have to delay my flip a bit just had a sniper shot bottom corner look at attempts i'll just keep this in good dunk i can leave now that's from gyro betting out the flick that can go again i can go again one more time probably it can be fine for p-dog pass back to p-dog here's a shot that's done good job hold on there so i don't really have any options other than pass it back so like hit it back to our side that was the safest option because i didn't see what was behind me right but i did see pdog creeping up i knew he had boost because he had just grabbed one not too long ago so i was a good pass to make because there's a lot more options if i do that keeps the flow of the play moving forward and we don't have to all like rush back and be in an awkward spot because of a bad pass back let's play it around him we got it it's well played i would say thanks but if i say thanks the other team doesn't see the nice one and it just looks weird it's not only like people have only team chat on because i can't reply to what their quick chats are this looks weird how many boosters i'm just faking maybe best case scenario can get out pretty quick here my team still keeps pressure really no bad side to this i might be able to score this i don't know i ran out of boost it's gonna be awkward alright 12 more boosts probably a goal i should have used it better before i jumped that was my problem take a bad path at it put this back in that gyro roll it back so i get above the ball as much as i can that way he has a much easier ball to work with once it gets back to him trying to fake him a little bit unfortunate i don't know if he can get back gonna fake again make him panic hit the ball away to our team gonna be up for this i'll let him have pass back to my teammate yet again should have an easier time on the backboard now your left side if he wants to use me here crosstalk shot on goal i should have one more touch across here to gyro on back wall it's gonna be there so i'll wait good touch should be a go hold done good play there good ball movement they really have a lot of options to get out of that situation that was really well played saw gyro cross i decided to use him and he saw the touch opportunity back down and he had me and p-dog chilling waiting for the pass i'll just bait this here so i'll make him hit it for all 50. either it's fine if he beats me there hits it over me it's actually good because gyro gets the ball for free if not it's a 50 and he also gets them all for free so both situations are pretty good for us fast from dire very good ball movement again down the field well played well played all right good first game one step closer to that beautiful looking ssl logo very very close very close see what mmr we're at now after that you can check in the menu i think 1866 one more game one more game all right we got p-dog again against uh milford high school varsity oh my there's varsity teams now actually crazy i didn't know that was a thing must be new and i wish there was that stuff when i was in high school but everything's getting bigger like esports in general are getting bigger it's really cool to see happy that kids in high school have the opportunity now gotta be fun let's get one more touch here find one more i can't follow that one up but it should be fine good pass from them should be okay to deal with for a sec all right i kind of got picked up by p dog but p dog left it for me i think which is actually a smart play from him as it was better for me i didn't want to mess them up so i waited as well kind of both just faked each other out i'll leave this one for diary better for him awkward touch for me so definitely a better baller just be patient on let's take a weird shot should be open for pdog good finish well played nicely done it's a good first touchdown on the wall gives me the opportunity to take a shot off of it off the back wall maybe even get a pass down middle they have to be patient and wait for all those potential outcomes right very tough spot for them to be and i'll try to kill the last man back here back in jarrah i sit back almost ended up ongoing but it should be fine i should be able to clean this up try to fake here should be easy for whoever's behind me those neutral 50s are good especially when you know your teammates close behind i know gyro's gonna be waiting in a good spot there i'll just keep pressure here not planning on scoring that ball but it's enough to put us in a good position for at least the next 10 seconds again shadow will always win the next ball on a situation pick their boost here big miss from them on not taking that boost i think it's going to be in a much more difficult spot now for a bit as long as gyro can win this possession we're going to be in a good spot gonna be an awkward situation now actually got a bit well let him hit this good 50. you're trying to follow up on the wave dash click from pdog dropping gyro back wall maybe good attempt very tough shot to score because it was kind of just directly forward or didn't really like lead me on in the air but it was still a good pass it's a really tough one to score but keeping it in there keeping pressure is more important than trying to go for a very risky shot rip a gyro shot here oh my i had like how did that work they ping-ponged it between each other that's crazy get 50. i can't really follow this up but i can at least bait this out so i'm going to make him hit it on the wall over to my team we ball now p-dog challenge doesn't always mean that you have to try to win the ball necessarily right if you're thinking more about how can i get possession out of this in the safest way possible that should be the goal when you're you're focusing on challenging somebody you should always try to think how can i win this ball without throwing away my position and giving my team the most like favorable opportunity on the next touch doesn't always have to be about you diving in on every ball it's not the most important way to challenge oh wait here i don't know how much boost played in a very weird spot for them touch from gyro b dog might be able to finish very unfortunate a lot of really good opportunities with the post like that twice now a little bit unlucky away from them really one of those games that we're gonna end up losing just because of how many close calls there's been normally how it goes how the story unfolds i have pumped off a little bit unlucky dog should be fine here i'm the third man it's gonna make a little bit awkward for them should be okay for a bit here i just fall asleep myself good fake for jarrah there we go that was perfect so i fly that ball quick with a lot of speed last second i turn off of it it gets a light touch and it drops down the gyro perfectly really good fake to make there got the mid boost here i'm fine with the back guy hitting this all you do is hit the guy in the ceiling should be fine now pretty easy situation to deal with the challenge again i can back off now got this mid boost i have full behind in a good position i could follow it up to be a goal eventually if i could bump this last guy back i said done very good plays this should be could potentially be the ssl game very sweaty one though a lot of close calls for sure i'll point to them they played pretty pretty solid should be a goal as well good try from jaira does end up being a goal after all yeah those touches where you go to the ball quick and you back off very good fake very good passes to make but yeah we unfortunately didn't end up getting ssl actually i'm surprised let's see how many points we're off 1875 i believe we ended up at 1873. two points off so in the next video in the next video we'll clinch we should be able to clinch or we'll already have it by then by playing on stream and stuff like that we'll see though maybe i'll save it for the next video that's gonna be obviously guys i
