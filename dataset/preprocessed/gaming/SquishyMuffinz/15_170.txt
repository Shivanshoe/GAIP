subs i appreciate you guys more than you know enjoy the video yo what's up guys going to be playing some threesome today with chicago and mist should be some good games miss from envy of course and chicago from g2 so it should be some quality games very stacked squad all around we're almost at the number one spot so if we catch some dubs today maybe we can steal it maybe we could just yoink it away probably get pretty close but might not actually reach today we'll see either way it will be fun no matter what and it'll be a lot of good plays so let's get into it hopefully we can get some dubs let's see how it goes i got a sweaty game shout out of the bat we got shock indigo and fifi so let's see how this goes not sure what to expect but we'll see let's start from mist wait for the bounce here get a double from him rotate behind chicago let me know that's his ball to go for good air dribble here it's a good touch to myself better played around another one very good touch from miss good shot from cargo as well well done good pressure [ __ ] off the bat there that was good positioning for miss he was ready for the the immediate follow-up right he was able to hit that off the back wall and then then chicago was ready in an even better spot to convert on that trying to maybe saw that i go for a bump quick before i leave not a terrible bump to go for it only goes bad there if my teammate loses that challenge pretty hard but you have to have faith in your team to win some of those you know let me go for the bump there if you're miss touch you have one more it looks like chicago should be able to go for this it done i was middle for the option if you wanted to use me obviously he didn't need to but if you wanted to use me there i was already in a position that i could just slot it it's a good play all around there had every every option covered let me just go for that rotate behind here should be cocker's ball next he's leaving it so i'll wait for mid pass you touch off the wall it's gonna be awkward for the last guy back and good bump from miss there good usage of each other good job the position where he did should we miss ball here my middle if he wants to use me i'll leave that for cargo probably better for him he's gonna be further back away from the ball right which means they didn't have a better angle on getting power on the ball and being able to set up our team very good play i'll leave that don't have to jump for it car goes up already gonna create some more pressure for us that's fine i'll go back for the boost here i can't really interfere with the ball but i can at least bump him and they should follow this up he's gonna have one more touch here most likely good try giving me caucus ball wait rebel if he wants to use me pass back to him close my first touch here shark's gonna have this all right we all picked each other i'll go left foot hit her on another one mission hit this to the ceiling gonna potentially be shootable close i ended up leaving because i wasn't sure if he was gonna be able to get the touch middle but i should have maybe stayed in a better spot to help out good challenge from miss there gonna be cargo's ball she'll be able to do something else with this nice good pass from conquer there as well played all right good first game that took quite a while to get that game but and they're pretty quick can't complain about that into the next one stephen keep it up get the back-to-back wins for today and if it's another quick game potentially we might do a third game we'll see i have to do a whole lot that game but building we needed to let's get to the next one let's get some dubs see how it goes all right for what might be the last game we got alpha shock and snipes he has two new teammates this time see how this game goes i'm gonna go for my teammate behind me try to follow this up myself that's just straight on my net but coco will be there good positioning from him bad 50 for me though i went straight to my knife cargo wasn't there obviously it's not a very good uh position to leave him in right someone's gonna have to rotate back quick for that and get a save on a ball pitching super fast to our net so we'll play from cargo to be there unlucky on the miss to follow up on that put around two of them close congress should be the first shot good snipe i'm gonna go for the mid boost here miss got demoed so i'm going to put a little bit of offense here nice pass from cargo that's a good shot from us good job to take our time there actually make a play out of this this car actually feels really nice i haven't tried this uh this variation of 20xx before started a scope for that didn't work out too well but bad idea was if you get a touch on it wait for his touch here tigers should realize that it's my ball next pass the mist close good shot well done tried to just slot that pass over to miss there definitely the right idea he was almost able to bang it he's not he's not gonna have much boost here i know that's out of some touch try to play it over one that's fine the 50's not terrible for us should be okay as well take the mid boost here miss normally pretty good in these positions he'll get up more times than not pass down to him i sit down well played well played good thoughts just from miss there i'm gonna call kick off here so he knows a lot of people in the rank do the left ghost thing i'm not sure if these guys do so i'd rather call the kickoff be safe than sorry you guys are all going to arrest me for how i say sorry because i'm canadian i say it a weird way you pass from him good fall from mist touch from cargo plate off the back wall it's gonna be the first shot good try pass it back down to cargo nice try to play it back down to him that's the right idea for sure they're all going to expect me to shoot that every single time so playing underneath the the pre-jumping defenders definitely the smarter player to make there all right another quick game so play one more game to finish out this video but it's a lot of fun playing these guys obviously it's going to be good games no matter what always going to be a lot of passing plays high-speed game play always fun to watch but uh yeah again to the next game see if we can finish out the video with another win get three back to let's see how it goes all right for the actual last game we got ourselves oh t corral and it's cha so we'll see how this goes it's gonna air dribble this miss gonna have it most likely try to follow some myself get a pinch mid maybe you try i'm gonna go all the way back here rotate behind my team i always try to rotate like opposite of the play that way you could turn in on the play that way you're not like caught up with your teammates as well it's crazy but like the way you rotate in and out of the play always affects the next like five seconds so make sure you rotate in a smart way it's always gonna benefit you more than gonna hurt you a little bit more effort into learning how to rotate properly like around your team and it's going to help you out more than anything i think i messed up a little bit but i get the perfect pass mid but it's fine because missed that anyway it's up for that already it's a really good spawn for him i'm gonna hit this again or at least panic for it hit off back wall now it's gonna be really hard for that guy a decent fake from miss even though i think he's trying to shoot it but in uh the beautiful game of rock league more often than not if you miss a ball like this it's going to be a free goal for some reason that's just how rocket league works you miss uh you missed a shot you should probably have and uh you end up getting a goal out of that i'll play it from kyle to be ready for that though nice touch from t corral should i follow this up myself off the back tobacco if i can bump the other one that'd be good that guy using the musty car it looks like the musty car right off the wall that i can leave i'm gonna leave cargo with a free shot most likely should be good for mist here as well off the back wall yet again pumped one out good patience for miss to be back here killed one for him now he doesn't have to worry about the guy challenging from behind it's fine i don't mind if he gets that touch he's gonna have no boost now at least low let me conquer his ball for free don't want to go for this quite yet though just in case i think congo might have thought i was going to go for it but i thought they were going to be closer just playing it safe just in case i could be across here though he wants to use me shot it right at him oh my god not the placement i needed all good though trying to maybe like put in a spot they wouldn't expect but he just waited he played a patient he put it smart right one shot try for missed very good positioning to be there it's in a really good spot to help out gonna fake this i knew there'd be somebody behind me right in a good position to follow that up so don't have to touch the ball away to them and i can just fake it put in a better position for them try to rotate around behind that way if there's a picture that comes in here should be able to follow it up good play for a miss he still has control display as well hit the crossbar no not hitting my shots this game but it's okay it happens as long as we catch the dub fine i can't complain wait for it if he wants to pass i'm not gonna go for this though third one up it's gonna have a double it shouldn't be dangerous though should be fine play forward to missed played to missed again it's going for the bump smart idea gotta go for this get in the way chicago should have a free irrigable attempt here good play a little bit weird like passenger play leading up to that but you got to go out of vignette right can't complain decent kick off two goal lead with a minute not looking bad by any means here good 50 so i'll play miss still going for this looks like so i'm just gonna wait should i just play this smart make them give my team the ball also get the boost out of it the huge demo should be a goal another smart demo was that a good time right where you know that if he does get the kill there which he did it's gonna lead to an empty net and a free goal that's gonna be it for listen guys i hope you enjoyed we ended up getting back to
