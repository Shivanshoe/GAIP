yo what's up guys going to be playing some games today with torment and gyro should be some googles let's get into it let's see how it goes for the first game playing against bodhi xd and nips i've actually never played any of these players but he found this game instantly so i'm conflicted as to what we're gonna get no idea what to expect maybe one there's four left close trying to go back should i have this i try to control for myself under the wall oh room one that's gonna be really awkward for him torment should have that nice i can get mid right i could have played that better on the on the back wall there and controlled it uh i wasn't in a very good spot honestly i thought it was going to be more of a pass than it was a shot but that's not on torment that's for me to to figure out there show you one more your block from him play mid left i'll be binding maybe one more would be huge from tour left side pass it's gonna go alone it seems like so i'm just gonna wait good try try i get one more touch here maybe one more oh my gosh i did not think i could score that i feel like i just kept gaining boost somehow i they have so much boost on the replay nice shouldn't go back it's fine it's wide low 50 gyro with the faller nice 50 again i won't be able to make it there that was a really good really fast middle and then did really good up the wall there landed in turtle mode and passed it tormund was a little bit pushed up there but i don't blame him because it probably looked like the guy in the wall messed up his recovery right for the bounce up one more time middle close might be kinda open it's fine been here for gyro wait for tour here nice said one more time probably try to place the shot there we go took my time with it we're not playing too bad this game oh the slot the absolute slotted you never know you never know when they're just gonna mess with their kick off you get a little freebie we take those play real quick here pass over to gyro play a pie now now should i go i shouldn't cut out a gyro there like that if i can go back i wouldn't do that but it's okay go back all the way let's go quick here toss it up high are we behind so we should have nice all right we can get a play here if we can get a touch off back or something never mind it's launching to our side these guys are feeling it one more more huge oh my god these guys are insane i'll turn the middle here there we go good pre-flip there score that should i control this i even made a mess of gyro that was on me there probably confused them a lot in that in the wall just put myself in bad spots should have this there we go i tried the shot that's close got the corner which is good nice challenge i'll preach up mid oh we still got it baby i had a feeling i had a feeling that would work it was one of those plays where you could just scoop it out middle and if i'm up early they go right to me that's the only way i was being into that ball that was huge all right i was able to convince y'all to do one more game for the video to get the video alive so let's get into it let's see how it goes all right so we got a super sweaty game for the last one we got typical which in itself is a absolute god very difficult player to play against that makes this three's team already so good but then you had a bunch of other players who really sold and it just makes it really difficult so we'll see got a solid all-around lobby here see what can be done here play from sip which i should have this i'll get mid left wicket window typical he likes to just slow down the play a lot try to control the ball for himself and kill time for his team very good team player in that sense where he kills a lot of time for everyone to get behind him and you'll never see him really over committing or making a a bad play so makes it tough to play against i'll block that one he's trying to go off the back wall for a teammate as smart kind of killing me let him at least have to take a wider turn so i can beat him now because of that nice is good good speed from gyro teach i'm gonna wait here could have actually been a goal that's close i might try to turn to midfield here actually i want i'm gonna go back it's safer go back let them make a play for it i like that a lot actually a little passing play might be good typical reads too strong right now close that's fine it's gonna kill they have no play going forward on that like there's so much space on gyro to make a play for it trying to pop it over them typically just waiting back here try to bait out whatever you can try to 50 ohm there we go good play i had a feeling torah turned there probably a really good job to stay on that ball that was really good aggression i like that a lot nice little arrow right into that i'ma cheat here it's be a huge win though to end off the video i'll pop it backward for him i knew he'd be behind me just go back now it's always a good play to make on those sheets you can honestly let me hit the ball sometimes you can just fade completely that's a good thing to do on those try to get it mid they're really awkward now good job good finish 242 left they can still come back for sure no doubt in my mind but we have a good good buffer here to work with i go back now nice try to follow this try to kill one really good dog i don't know how he dodged that to be honest that's really good i thought i was in the path of the ball good block funk for a while but i'm gonna hold into my boost just in case you ever know if a challenge could be won and then you can follow it up so i have to hold on to it tommy might be able to go for this he's gonna wait smart probably better play it's closer to them too so i'm not really going to win a challenge here shouldn't even waste any more boost one sip is on the wall he always controls those out i'll just go for this it's good to the corner good follow from gyro zip's gonna have one more he always says to himself probably one more again there we go there's a good block maybe you can toss it down field miss there we go gonna wait middle there just in case you missed it was an awkward read for him so it's a good one to be ready for and that's gonna be the games for today guys i hope you enjoyed play a little bit better than the last video i think we're we're starting to get out of our slump so guys i just checked and typical's actually ranked number one on the leaderboard right now so yeah we ended up being the number one ranked threes player i didn't know he's number one in threes i know he's up there in twos he's number two and twos but beat the number one ranked threes player and the right leaderboard right now so that's a pretty good game pretty big win to get yeah hope you guys enjoyed like i said i'll see on the next peace you
