yeah you always be notified when I upload enjoy the video guys logo you know what's up guys in the previous video we finished off at diamond to Division 3 so I'm ready up the diamond too which is pretty nuts we still have yet to lose a game so hopefully we can keep that up in today we're probably gonna have some pretty tough matchups so we can't underestimate anyone but to start off the video as always in this series we're going to randomize our car so see what we get and the venom alright I actually like the venom cut a bit but the problem is the boost that we got in this random preset is very very poufy so if we have camera settings that are super low down it's gonna be kind of hard to see so that's what we're rolling with this is the car that we got for today and let's hope the settings that we get actually go well with this car else guys huge shout out to the viewer who made this program they tweeted it at me and it's very well done honestly so this is gonna save us so much time in the beginning of every single video thank you so much clear dot games I appreciate that and as he says here on the website randomizer conversations for some rocket League fun made for the man of legend squishy muffins subscribe to his YouTube channel to get her to 1 million subscribers yeah thank you brother I appreciate that this is super super amazing this is gonna help us so much at the beginning of these videos to save us time so now we don't have to go through each setting individually and randomize it all we got to do is go here press the randomizer button and there we go those are our settings for the video so let me just input those really quick and we'll be off alright guys so here it is these are the randomize settings at the website gave us and honestly I thought these are gonna be impossible to see anything with to be honest just looking at the field of view and distance this combination right here it's gonna be super hard to see anything let's hop into free play just to see what these look like 90 negative 4 isn't bad at all that's actually a duo of settings that a lot of pro actually use right now so it's not bad at all but the bad part about these settings is the field of view in distance those two being solo together it's gonna be super hard to see anything so this video is gonna be really hard to play out to be honest and we got zero stiffness as well we're gonna make things a little bit better honestly because our distance the field of view is so low we're at full speed it'll go further away from the camera so it kind of helped us out so it's hopping a free play just to see what it's like really quick oh no dude oh no so we're a full speed it kind of gets a little more playable but it is so hard to see our car this could be the episode that we lose to be honest this is this is gonna be really hard man and I'm not familiar with the venom at all but we can't go from any air dribbles okay so what I'm noticing already is everything's gonna be really hard to do because there's a certain part where you learn you can't see your car at all so we're gonna have to stay pretty grounded I try to play some shots on goal over and over again and hope they make mistakes so I try to pull it out smarter more than anything the whole point of this unit is trying to win obviously when by as much as possible so we can do everything in our power the hard part is that we have the slight disadvantage in this case a massive disadvantage so we'll see what we could do let's get into the games for today though like I said we're at 908 MMR in diamond and what are we playing some pretty solid players and the problem is if we're playing a player who doesn't play once much and the rank is still below diamond this is gonna be really rough like your play gets a grand champion TV to player and ones I don't know if we could beat them with these settings we'll see that let's get into it let's see how it goes all right so I've begins to 894 MMR play so they're also Dimond there's gonna be rough dude and this guy's really good there's no way we keep up with these settings alright messed up is this catcher ready we got a good kill like I said we gotta play smart to counteract the fact that we can't see Oh a lot here let's try to use our brain more than anything we can't do a lot of very fancy mechanics obviously it's because we can't see where our car is got a weight I'm scared dude I don't want to lose we'll stay on this get around the first shot it save I backed off a nice little boost here so shadows bang another one make it awkward hopefully he panics for this I got for an aerial oh my gosh he actually saved it a little bit lucky in terms of the fact that I hit it directly at him but outside of that it was good of him to time that properly but still I heard that anywhere else on goal that's gonna be in kind of just hit it right at him there we go good little kick off cool also my name is now Dwight I change to Dwight and I got a picture of Dwight I kept forgetting to change it and I have seen comments saying that I should also randomize camera shake but it's already kind of hard to watch as this with the weird settings so oh my god almost insane with these settings it's kind of hard to watch it ready with the way settings are so I don't want a camera shake to make it completely unwatchable and I mean close to many clothes on a double taps you guys gotta try these settings out though so you can see how hard it is to to get a read of stuff and where your cards at I shouldn't work for that good block though getting away I don't have any BC really and get full now you're just going full the aggressive which is fine get the boost make him back off a [ __ ] crap like that normally forces it up wanted to back off a little bit surprised he challenged that but then again he's being very aggressive so we gotta just play off of that aggression it might be a goal that's what I mean by play off that aggression display play safe play passive they're gonna they're gonna let me go too far in for some challenges that they shouldn't be going for and it's gonna give me the advantage I need chad has hit this close and then go for a flick quick I'm gonna let him have that he's already up I heard him jump I can't see him but might used to work oh good save I try to stay with this ball boost and pop up a little unfortunate but I still get the boost hopefully get back to this I don't know felt if you just angle or not I think he missed like I stay passive and get a free go out of it there we go that's got to be the way we have to play for this video because like I said we can't really create too many plays not being able to see 90% of our car if I hope he gives it to us and in lower ranks and what we wanted you will have opponents that will over address and give you free goals even at higher rank do you play a defensive placed on when very many games you can spot great shapes but you need better settings in this against better players for sure oh who actually got that in the hard part is any touch I have to make with the back of my car that's what makes it really difficult yeah this guy's not bad at all super solid you never know what's gonna get though in these mobile games there's so many people that just have it played once much played other game modes I still had receipts internet I almost missed it well I shouldn't get that little bit of a pop around them Oh how's nice you know nothing terrible by any means we have a really good lead here and it feels like we're all playing in pretty well you can go off your goal here oh I could see my card in marquee that's that's the issue what I was saying when I was saying I can't go for antique raise their grab some pads that makes it easy to see where the pads are these settings that's crazy should I wave - sure Adam Oh didn't wave - setting off a good view of my back wheels but still gotta go out a bit because we hit it around him he's the ball to your advantage in any game mode two threes ones someone's coming at you like that use the walls tap it around them and you still a possession then you can still move forward with the ball and get it over maybe even one more player if you're playing to two threes yeah pretty solid first game we got the dub well maybe play two more just because I was kind of quick also we just got a promotion to Diamond three off that so that's nuts already almost up the champ one which is insane so yeah play one or two more games we'll see depends how long it take but that one was super quick I feel like so again to the next and we'll see how it goes and I'm kind of worried about we're gonna match up against we're getting into champ ranks now we're getting so close the champ so let's see plenty that's another diamond player 894 mm or try to just pop this once I can stay on the ball he's gonna back off probably so let's go for a shot on goal missed I'm a little bit I could back off there make him come to me I just pop it around him there we go I put him in the awkward spot once I get to play one's out though just kind of keep tossing balls in awkward positions make them oyster boosts put them in a spot where they're uncomfortable and you'll eventually get gold out of it you're trying to kick off ball I can go off the wall for this try the banging on goal CD does I don't want to my boosters I can stay on this turn maybe get a shot of it as well and there we go I don't need a waste booze because I am already going full speed there so just hold to the busi do you have it try to make a play that you could follow up catch them off-guard I don't need to go back there I still address make things awkward I'll go down here try to get one more that is so hard to do on these settings been so scared I can't see nice try hit it around me I started going toward the goal it's a really good shot to throw off opponents try this down this ball trying to stay in front still that's pretty good 50 considered I can't see anything not bad at all shock for me tried to steal my boots I think I got it over him though I just gotta get it on target I think I've missed yeah I slightly missed pop it up touch middle almost got the double did it so hard I can't see what's happening the back half of my car I'm so much pressure does back and forth is what I like to always the time always played once keep rushing the corner boosts keep him in a position where they're not comfortable and they'll eventually make a mistake here you're gonna make a big mistake or just gonna get to the ball faster than him again he still has no beef so one way out does he really have just stuck in the uncomfortable position over and over again that was a good challenge I take them into beast Roman though I was gonna force them to have to stay aggro with low boost it's gonna eventually make him over a dress for something here or back off and give me free of all possessions that's fine as well yeah yeah so he had all the control they were forcing him to come to me over and over and over again and eventually he's gonna crack we have a lot of opportunities that we obviously would have scored on good settings but the point is you just want to keep taking that corner boost control over and over again till eventually you get a go out of it I'm gonna go for a flippy six that could have a good idea where I wanted to hit on the ball so I just kind of waited with the fake instead I'll go for this that fake jump was a little bit too obvious it was gonna go for the ball so I just gave me a window of opportunity a challenging little good shot there for the Seahawks guys pretty much the main tip I would give you is just try to hit the ball as centered as possible and flip through the contact on the ball don't get like a weak contact with your flip the more you flip through the ball the better your chaos gonna be so yeah it's time your flip properly get a really time your foot probably try to get back here feel for something cheeky I was only going for the goal yet let's challenge them I got the full speed here look around the corner I could try to do something tell you see if I can hit it into him for the own goal gonna quite there I just pop that top corner I think we got it there we go that's gonna shot and there we go another forfeit all right were you played a World War we put over again because both of those are forfeits put me in the [ __ ] I guess he knows you're not I changed my name and everything I guess it is still an office character so it's probably obvious but yeah alright we got nothing to give up from that pretty solid play one more game should get into one kmm are already really so close to champ 1 that's nuts let's get into the next alright playing against a 935 mm our place this is another diamond 3 so this should get us in to champ what I'm assuming if we were this not entirely sure to be honest but good guessing the champ one here trusty on this ball look for what he's doing I win the 50 see him on the side so I can just a single jump for that pumped it up high I'll let him have first touch here he is closer that's fine it's gonna make him eat the ball back to me there because I was just waiting stay on this so hard to get a kid enjoyable but we should try not to even set those up for ourselves if you know we're not comfortable doing that in these settings I'll show you here for this now a 44 boost here it's probably to take the corner from us our T's not so I'll tell you could tell this is still a lower right player obviously because a lot of the higher grant players would have went for that boost for sure you read for my baby stairs yeah but I still have 38 like I take this corner there's no really a big deal I just can't get a counter out of it right away and I kind of baited him into a position to make a mistake there I kind of just stood in one spot was it easy target for a demo and we got a free go out of it I'll fake challenge kick off free ball alright doesn't challenge area to be honest was a good fake challenge there like I mentioned in one of the earlier videos fake challenging or ones such an importance to matter what rank you are you gotta throw them in every single game at least once mess up your opponent get the ball back on your side for free I can't get a good touch out of this trade away I would just throw it away to him at that point surprise you challenged to be honest but then again ball is still in my control here so the hard part is when I get to Friday like that it was literally on a part of my car where I have no vision of anything so I had to kind of paint here but in a normal game there I saw before control over that Boulder there's no there's no possible way that you can score that so I'm gonna get a good touch to trapped into the corner you can't get a challenge on me just cuz I panic not being able to see what's happening Thank You Faye challenging until you eventually use the ball up there we go try to shoot this one look I've missed I believe in the rebound never mind I don't believe it's rebound dude this is so difficult otherwise it's harder now you're playing a better player but yeah it's kind of obviously gonna do that he didn't turn his part too much around the boss didn't give himself more options he kind of just stayed straight the whole time there we go he's in an awkward spot sighs challenge Creek took advantage of it we need this win keep our streak alive nice kick off there we go and those are so spooky on these settings in and you guys definitely give these a try 100% so you can feel harder to see these it's fun though won't lie to you too much now to yourself is he's putting himself at too many spots for ISIL boost control and he's kind of dribbling back with no booze so I can outrun him which means I can either bump him off the ball like I just did or kill him and get a free goal so either way it's not good for you you want to flip that back to your corner try to get possession in a spot where it's safe and there's no danger and you're getting scored on right away there's a good flick a position like that you should just kind of turn on me fake challenge make me go earlier like maybe flick that earlier than I did or just trend up challengeable you can't be editing like that this gives too much space for the dribbler I mean in that position he's just hoping for for me to get a bad flick and you know you could just save it easily but it's not gonna happen every time you can't really rely on the other person to mess up every single time some scenarios you have to obviously but yeah the goal he just got was a good demo from him but I made the mistake of putting myself in a spot where I could be demo'd save played patient that we need to go for a shot for that was card movement toward the ball had to finish fake challenge so I just take a shot on goal now never here any panic or anything because you guys would fake challenging his first challenge almost every single time so you want to mix those up that's what I mean by mix it up don't do the same thing every time fake challenge a couple times and throw in just a challenge where you go straight in that's gonna throw people off really hard gonna be super aggro here try to get control that that pattern here just go busto boost and there we go add that brand in that whole situation cuz he was lowered boost to me none of that and it wasn't a spot where he's not gonna expect me to turn and shear it away so again if I'm drilling this bum most likely he's just gonna fake challenge first time unless is on the on the ground when it's on the ground like that people tend to to go right away what she did in that time he's still went for the fake challenge but I didn't panic because I know that that is his tendency that's one of the main things you can pick up you're playing someone over it over again it won't be one is how that I challenge it's a huge thing to to understand as well because if there's someone's challenges right away every single time when they don't fake challenge you can flick early and you'll get goals for free every single time if they do fake challenge then as soon as I come toward you you know that I'm not gonna hit it so flick as soon as they're coming toward you didn't catch them off-guard but yeah we got the pro in the chip one off that super super solid stuff we still have yet to lose a game super happy about that and in the next video is gonna just get harder and harder from this point on so hopefully we can get some settings and a car that we enjoy using that's not gonna be super difficult to use but either way this series has been a blast and it's been a challenge and a half so when we got champ one two three and then obviously promotionally grand champ to go so we're not far off by any means there's a video over hope you guys enjoyed have
