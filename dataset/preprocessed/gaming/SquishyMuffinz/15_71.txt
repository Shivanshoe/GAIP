yo what's up guys gonna be solo queueing some 2v2 games it is pretty late at night right now so hopefully we can actually find a match let's get into it see if we get some dubs all right first game we got ourselves stealth against creams and parts so sweaty lobby off the bat all pretty good twos players try to just pressure him from my teammate that's awesome as long as i make him go up the wall like anything there i think works pretty well don't even need to like full commit on that i don't think it's worth it unfortunately we both went but it should be okay for a bit still round one 50 there we go it's a really good play there i don't flick it away from myself i just play it around him in field gets around the first guy pretty much for free the second guy i can just low 50 kept possession pretty well timed it perfectly where when i jump keeps the ball on me still i can't pass this but i can go for an edge with them should still be good for us here i don't know if i could turn in time to let him hit it and it kind of touches fine just trying to sell time to get me some boost this comes back nice good shot for some reason my controller keeps doing this thing because it keeps you seeing for some reason so if you see me like accidentally double jump but i'm trying to flip shoulders like glitching out i'm not trying to do that on purpose it's a good touch for him it's not gonna really do too much teammates should be okay unless we read his fake challenge pretty well also not good to fake challenge if you're under the ball like that you're almost always gonna get b or b at a really big disadvantage so a little bit of a mistake from him you should have this wait right side it's fine i don't mind getting beat to a ball like that because again my teammates almost always going to have the advantage on the next ball almost always obviously like this time right here teammate like okay he could have very easily got to yet he said sorry but he could have very easily got to the ball if he just went the wall quicker i think he tried to fake him and hoped that it would make whoever was like next up on the ball just like panic and get a worse touch than you wanted obviously it didn't happen how you wanted to but it's okay to try stuff like that and most of the time it's not going to be a bad situation so i would say leaving your teammates like that's not bad almost ever as long as you know things go a little bit better than how they did right there i think what he what he wanted to happen just didn't come through how he expected nice dub to control played over one good pop you have to get one touch now i'm gonna give me a little bit of space to get this boost i got the bumps even better try to get out of the way at the end there so we had a chance to actually get a shot on that same kind of thing there like backed off last second played around one that way that guy can't actually challenge just to hit it away now it should be back let's try to leave it for him now any kind of touch is fine again just to kill some time to get a boost anytime it's like a big hit like that in front play like especially in 3v3 it's mostly just to kill time to get boosts because you never really want to throw a possession on purpose so if you're doing something like that it's because you're trying to kill time for yourself in a spot where the next play is not going to be dangerous at all for you let him hit this it's fine i'm going to panic a little bit more so i didn't have to do anything there the whole time didn't even end up in a bad situation at all playing the situation out safely i play after my teammate nice can't actually challenge this though i gotta wait and look the ball just comes to me for free a little bit of patience i tried to see if i could read him get like below 50 on that block that's worth it i think yeah my teammate gets by the first guy that's going to be a goal i definitely take that every time the guy rotating back his job is going to be to clean up whatever the first man can do right so if you can kill the second guy the whole play is kind of in the gutter because as long as my teammate can get it past the first gonna be a goal every single time there they're set up like layered where the first guys are challenging for a second there's no second then they have no help i have a lot of times let me go up the lock and just go for the boost take this across trying to dunk me i'm not gonna give them the dunk played around one just bumping me up i can play this mid though should be good good trying to fake took an extra second to make a move make him like kind of get antsy smart [Music] right to the corner see what he does you're just gonna bait it make him flick or whatever it's fine i bump him that's good you're underrated to do that same thing here i'm not really even committing as long as i make them jump a bunch of times it's not even really me committing in my opinion you could play for them though they had one guy back well put it on my teammate well and then there's one get back wall [Music] nice good job there we go good first game let's get the next one even keep it up get back to back dubs not sure i start spamming what to say but okay first match so let's get into the next one all right we got creams and parts again we got ajax on our team this time [Music] good kickoff to start he had a really late cheap i think he was just trying to do a safe cheat where if the carrot went bad he'd be there for it so wherever you go about it i'll play it around them it's like a little light touch on the ground really surprised he pre-jumped that very interesting these two players man they're a different breed they don't know consequences that's for sure i mean what do you really lose if you lose a rank game some ritual points you know why not play crazy makes sense try to block us to the side a little tip if like we get to the rank where people are doing that stuff all the time like that so we'll play stuff in the air just try to float you float in their path or most of time you're gonna cover everything they get above you like really high above your teammate should be there for it i'll try to play it down for him i shouldn't done that there i should have stayed solo the threes play the threes player within me it's a really good first touch here controlled in the air nice little x touch to catch on the ground really well done probably like really hard for him to know what was going on gotta watch the bump here i don't recommend this either i have no reason to commit on this right because he's gonna panic right here my q to go for the ball i play it low on the wall you can't really do much again just play it around him if he commits now it has to be your perfect touch or else now they're both committing on something that's not great bump the mid guy as well really good save teammates should go for me if it gets over him i should be okay [Music] a little bit nervous the situation he did the floating thing i was talking about it worked pretty well for him i didn't even see him but it should still be okay i'm gonna go a little risky for the beast oh good i had a lot of faith in him just winning this challenge or just being able to kill enough time for me to come back get a demo because we're just stuck [Music] it was a tough situation to get out of [Music] honestly oh that bump would have been huge oh you can win this you can definitely score this i messed up let's touch [Music] the chart on the 50 there i don't have any boost but i'll try to be annoying that's fine that works puts me back on 30 boost should be next up here it's a good challenge get a bump on the way back and be huge i'll just stay on this let him hit that doesn't matter [Music] i played it around so like every touch i make there is just trying to keep possession that's my whole goal the whole situation round one just trying to keep the ball again same situation right you should be in a spot to follow it up i can't follow that though so i gotta leave my main goal always is to try to keep position even in threes get this back to my team should be better for him now he has a lot of time a lot of time to work with a lot of space to work with [Music] i thought he wouldn't be back in time honestly so i try to get for a quick shot just don't work out well for us to get us away oh i got the extra touch it was just too soft got a good kill on one it's gonna be a really uh tight finish here at the end i don't know who's gonna take this it's probably gonna be a bad goal though who's almost always is some sort of like over commit you should take that i'll take a little bit of an extra second to go for the back boost i think it's worth it because it's no little threat especially my teammate has the ball right no reason not to like probably go to your way to like be in a better position and get some boost i don't want to be behind him like super close behind him that goes flying over his head it's like no downside he's going for the back booster ah trying to play to the left of him it still works though block let's get away for his next challenge it's fine have a 1v1 now played over full don't have enough boost on the thing oh wow that worked i heard them both up so i just played it around them and then played it down in front of that and then he just fell into it i did not mean to queue i'm done for the day but i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is but here to watch this like
