yo what's up guys so today's video is going to be a little bit different it's going to be a challenge video and you guys have probably seen this around youtube on rocket league for a little bit now but this is known as one of the hardest challenges in all of broccoli it's 1v7 against golds they're everywhere they're going to be bumping they're going to be going for all kinds of weird stuff and you just got to be ready for it so we're going to see if we can do it we'll be playing a best of three against them so first the two wins wins if they win one game off me but i win two i still win this series against them so it's gonna be a fun video it's gonna be a fun thing to see how it goes i'm actually not sure what to expect i think we'll learn a lot of the first game that's why it's good it's the best of three but uh yeah thank you to my mod from twitch mex you can follow me over on twitch by the way the link's down below in the description it's just squishy muffins that's my twitch thank you max for helping me find these seven golds while i was streaming uh he verified that they're all golds and they're all legitimately gold um so it should be good and it should be a lot of fun so let's get straight into the game i'm gonna look at the lobby i'm gonna tell them all the info and uh yeah let's get into it we got one two three four five six we're waiting on one person as the last person's loading into the lobby guys if there's any kind of challenge video like this that you want to see me do make sure you let me know down below in the description and the top comment will be the one that i do for a video so let me know down below and make sure you guys check the comments and actually leave some likes on some comments that way i know which ones you guys want to see the most so yeah let's wait for the last guy to get in here and we'll finally start it up and try to learn how to play against seven goals and see if we can actually beat them and i think goals are generally getting better so the longer longer way to do this video the harder it's gonna be so let's get into it let's see if we can actually win some games here it'll be kind of sick if we can but yeah let's see if we can do the most impossible rock clip challenge all right they're all joining up took them a while to know that they could join up but they're all joining up and uh we're already starting it off i don't think they're i think the whole fact that they're on my team is kind of confusing them but this is interesting already oh my god this is a swarm of them okay on time when we have it that's the best way to go about this i think they're already making mistakes there we go this is going to come down to just playing smart and uh controlling the ball we can i think that's going to be the hardest hardest thing because you can see how many of them there are and the kickoffs are going to be a pain absolute pain to do anything i genuinely think as time goes on they're going to start bumping more but this is going pretty well i'm not going to lie as time goes on they're going to start bumping more and it's going to become a lot tougher i think right now they're like not sure if they should go full bump mode but this is a very good start two goal lead but this this can change super easily i think gotta save my boost see they're already bumping on kickoff i think they're all uncommons by the way they're on discord so they're talking about it what they should do aerials are not going to be something that they're good at so that's something that i got to take advantage of the fact that i can read the ball quicker than them thoughts on high shots like that and we're going to be looking good a very very good start this is going super well so far and you can see they're already starting to bump me so they're already starting to adapt two goals in so this is gonna make this very difficult on me it's gonna come down to hitting my shots when i have them and making sure that i use my aerials and my advantage in the air and my advantage in reading the game and i gotta use that and actually convert off of it that's a good pinch from them didn't go straight in but i'm getting bumped constantly getting bumped oh my god the good thing is here is that normally the gold rank is already bad with rotations but you throw an extra an extra five people on the field and it's definitely not going to be looking too good rotation wise so we could take advantage of a lot of things here and we're doing exactly that i have not seen someone play seven goals and do this well this early on so we're definitely setting a record right now we can win two games here like this with this much of a blowout i don't think that'll happen because i think they'll definitely adapt and start playing better but this is a crazy good start crazy good start and i could tell they're ready they're trying to like think of some play here on kickoff it feels like i gotta watch the bumps one is bumping me on back ball i can beat them to the aerial here go down for the boost if i take my time that's a good play from them that's good i should be able to get back here put this up the wall grab the boost that way i still have possession they're not going to be comfortable going on the wall here they're trying to bump me to be able to be anybody that jumps for this ball pretty easily maybe even one more in a shot that's a really good block from the blue guy i'm gonna wait here place up the wall when i can cut off these plays i'm gonna try to as well because i can that's a good play for them though there's so many of them the little mistakes will always be capitalized on because look how many of them there are that can possibly get the goal right i made one mistake on my touch there i didn't catch it up the wall properly and there was four people there to slam that in so stuff like that you have to be ready for let me go for kickoff i don't think this is the right thing to do but i'm just gonna try it for one that way we can learn what actually happens out of it i can see one trying to go for a bump should be anybody that goes for this ball i'll definitely have the advantage on anything airborne so they should probably try to keep the ball on the ground as much as they can i'm just gonna fake going for that shot i got the other boost i killed one which is okay i guess there's still six people on the field it's obviously gonna do a whole lot for me through the ball wagon hit it around two of them it's gonna be really awkward for them i could probably just shoot off this to be honest very difficult there we go that's hard for a high level player to reach so i know for sure gold players not reset even if there's six of them in front of me i'm fairly confident that i can get that goal you can truly see the difference in the skill gap between gold and all the way up to pro level obviously i'm one of the the higher level pros but you can see the big difference in game and i guarantee the difference between these goals and players that just started playing the game is just as big as well like the amount of skill gap in rock league is insane this video is showing exactly that how crazy it can be try to go back here let them all panic we see them trying to play more defense i think they're trying to stack them a little bit more but these solos aren't really going to work that's the thing they're going to probably have to learn oh that's a really good uh bounce for them not going to lie i thought i might have had that can we brazil them let's see that's the the true test here good demo well done well done well done i can't get myself in a position where i can get demo like that that's the thing i gotta try to avoid i gotta avoid being demoed in those situations all right gotta watch the bump two of them going for the bump shop the bat here played around them not a terrible bounce i can wait back here i kind of don't want to play defense i feel like being aggressive in this game is going to be the most important thing as well the more you're on defense the more you can get bumped and immediately scored on right more on offense i can get goals over them i can make plays over them i know that it's about waiting for your opportunity to do that i gotta watch the demos is the main thing though but it's good to know that the players on your team can't demo you right that's the one thing that is a very good thing to know the fact that i have the speed that i do have and the ability to read the game that i do have gives me such a big advantage over them though that's the thing that i know when i can go for a shot i know when i can take a shot and get a go out of it i know when it's bad to commit to something it's going to come down to just not getting demoed that's going to make the big difference i think so like there was two guys there they both forced me to make a mistake those two guys coming at me that quick with those two demos one should have killed one at me i had to take a soft control touch for myself here and then i thought that first guy was going to demo me so made me panic that's a good thing for them to do over and over again can't go for a boost here i have to try to take a pad explain the pat okay i see that i like to play actually from them played around two of them good play because i still got to stay on the ground after you got that boost which makes it a little bit difficult but it's fine they faked each other as gold stew ship it a beat into this and get a good shot on goal see what they do off of that let's take a shot on goal that's not to be anything crazy right i have a three goal lead more just to keep pressure in here again it's in the air i know that's my go-to to go for the ball that's my green light that i can actually do something off of it i'm gonna fake challenge you just make a panic same thing here just make them panic at this ball to me hopefully and now i'm gonna have a free ball on the wall don't let them have that that's okay it's really no big deal in throwing that ball away because look look how much panic there is i have a three goal lead still with a minute left pass right to me i'm gonna go for the shot i could say from him i'm just gonna corner i don't want to have a free touch there's headed to the corner never a harder time breaking that out of their half and i have a pretty good opportunity to fake challenge again same situation here just trying to make them panic keep fake challenges i can go back now 48 seconds and the ball is high in there i should be able to get into this pretty easily big challenge here it's able to get back take our back boost hopefully about to get bumped here they're all going for the bump and he accidentally hit it back into his own half off the bump the gold plays special they're struggling just to get out of their half which is really good for me obviously play up the wall go in a pretty good position here so i follow this up one more time 17 boost good play from us okay they can't win now it's impossible for them to win they played really well the first game i think they're going to adapt and play better for the the next one or two if they win the next one obviously to best of three i'm not sure if they know what's best for you and i'd let them know what a shot okay we're playing really well honestly doing really good it's a best of three by the way so i have to one more you guys i have to win two all right good first game though we got a lot of good goals seven goals when we got goals against us when we got bumped so we know we have to just avoid that and if we do that i think we're gonna be looking at the uh another win here back to back one of the gold players is game crash so as we're waiting for him again a huge thank you to one of my twitch mods named max helped me out a lot with this video he got all seven of the goals verified that they're all goals there's no one in here that's a smurf from a higher rank of course um every single person in this lobby is guaranteed certified to be gold he checked all their profiles um so yeah huge shout out to him for doing all that heavy lifting all the hard work and finding these players and uh yeah thank you to all the goals that actually took time to take part in this video obviously means a lot after the games are all done we'll be talking to these seven players and seeing what they think about the games and how they went but yeah he ended up joining up there he is the last player we're winning on colin so let's get into it i'm gonna join up hopefully they know to join up to get our back boost here there's a little bit of a break there i'm a little bit iced iced out now my momentum is gone that's fine get two in a row here hopefully again play the aerial game you know we have an advantage in the air played around all of them there let's take here give me something they're going for the bumps that's a really tough spot to get out of it's gonna be eagle yeah it's tough that's actually a really good pass i think that's a good pass in high level gameplay so you got to give him credit there you got a good touch and he went for the bump on me the other guy not a lot you can do there oh good though one goal 30 seconds in i'm not gonna go with kickoff i just watch the bumps though it's a good touch i get the boost as well i gotta soft touch to myself maybe i go out of it close unlucky post hit they're all panicking a little bit though so you might be able to take advantage of this gotta try to play a little bit more safe in so many situations they can still make touches on these balls you definitely got to play in a way where you're you're covering all the the possible mistakes right all right there we go all i have to do there is get a shot on go i went quiet so i wanted to make sure i didn't miss because if i missed that it probably converts of course there are so many of them that can just easily counter the ball across the field good job though it's very easy to realize that their their weak points are when you hit the ball high in the air i got to watch the bump here from snowy panda that's the one that i should be careful of luckily they're not like going super hard on the bumps off kickoff but there's definitely people following me around no boost here i'll try to get this back but you should come up soon i gotta watch the bumps here let's go quick for this ball that's fine i got bumped into it i'll take it but they're going hard on the bumps now you can tell they're definitely going to have you on the bumps so it's fine i'll take that i have no boost i'm trying not to get bumped in a situation having no boost here is really bad honestly because they have so much time to actually get a play going i just need some boost any boost would be perfect they're starving me perfectly here now i need this corner really bad ah surely they score one of these gotta stay close to this ball keep getting good 50s go back all here right they faked each other we should come back again good bounce for us honestly all right staying grounded in these situations is really good i don't know how we're holding on here but we are we're stuck in a half there for a whole minute pretty much oh it's bad how's that play messed up pretty badly there it's gonna be convert however something cheeky but i mean they're bound to score eventually i think they had way too much pressure on me they kept on cycling perfectly like really good rotations stealing my boost bumping i can't believe i just had really good rotations but it was it was hard to get out of there so you gotta give him credit play it high i try to follow this again nice there we go good aggression i think we just need to be more aggressive we can't give them time to make moves we can't take our time controlling the ball in our half we gotta boom the ball out hit it over their heads we have the advantage in speed we have the advantage in mechanics so we have to use it watch the bumps here yeah it's really good bump from him and a good boost grab good bumps and he shot it perfectly what can i do about that oh my gosh that was a good that was the ball played kickoff i got bumped by two of them they had stole my boost and then he just launched top bins hey yay well played i'm gonna go for a back boost here oh my god he missed oh no him is falling apart okay we're good we're chilling i don't have any boost though hit it high try to just follow it that's all i can do i got the boost it's actually really good that i can get that boost there right to the corner see what they do you just boost again all right this could be really big now there we go if i can get any bit of time to actually take the ball by myself i can get to go out a bit the hard part is getting that time because they're just swarming they just swarm the ball as soon as they get a chance to this is getting tough though because they're definitely bumping a lot more the bumps are the key for them i think really give me a super hard time that's fine could just control it to the corner i need this boost though wait for that touch good 50 from us you can't actually follow this and get a shot most likely i'll just hit it hit a corner i can't take the boost either so i gotta just wait didn't hit this way most likely i got to be very careful here now there's the danger zone all right we're good we're good for a second i need some boost though we got nothing in the tank decent touch for us still got nothing though i need to grab some boost i can get there i would own gold such a tough spot to be in i had more time than i think i did because there was one guy just jumping onto the wall it's so funny looking okay take these two pads oh we almost almost got a counter on their plate okay we could tell they're going for more bumps because they're like on kick off there we had three guys just going for a up bump on me no one was even going for the ball so that was actually very smart play for them i think they're talking more about going for the bumps what a save and they're actually going crazy this game might force the game three looking like they might force the game three good saves they're playing it well that's gonna be game i think what can i do here played river two got another pop could be good potentially no way oh my god oh my god my heart's pounding after that what the heck i had four guys five guys in that in front of me and i thread the needle all right could be epic it could be epic if we win this or also very sad we'll see oh we caught them out let's go we did i can't believe we did that oh my god i can't believe we did that i know you guys over here if you used to watch me all the time i'm not one to normally get like super excited but that was crazy that was actually crazy we thought this is your second goal and we went off that we have five guys going to bump us we catch him off guard we get the shot i had my heart pounding man g geez we're gonna join discord with them and see their thoughts on the games we won two straight very fun stuff let's hear what they had to say let's see what they have to say let's join up um yeah we definitely should have won that yeah like that was like the ground is so easy and the ball was rolling yeah it was just so easy until like the last second you know um we don't we all just got nervous at the last second yeah i think i think that's what it is i can tell you guys you guys started communicating it felt like like we had to bump it down yeah yeah yeah the bumps the bumps definitely got better from the first game to the second game i think if this is like a seven game series like the best of seven you guys probably start bumping way more and like you get way more goals out of it yeah the first game i tried demoing you but like i realized i was on your team having the through the players on my team is they can't demo me but you guys can still bump me which makes it annoying that one goal you got in that game that we just played i got bumped three times and someone top cornered it like perfectly there's nothing like that i was pretty lucky yeah they got like pinched between opposing teenagers yeah yeah yeah you deserve that one for sure that's a lot of fun they guess for choosing i appreciate you guys helping out i understand yeah all right have a good night guys all right thank you so much youtube merry christmas thank you yeah happy holidays good
