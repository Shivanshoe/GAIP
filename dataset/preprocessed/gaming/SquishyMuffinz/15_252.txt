I was doing a couple videos here there and you guys were asking me how to do it so I'll show you guys how I personally do it I don't know how this is done by other people but I know this has been done by other people I just don't know exactly how they do it this is how I learned to do it on my own and I think that this is probably the easiest way to try to do it yourself if you want to it's not crazy useful in game honestly it just looks really cool and it does give you some speed if you have no boost it can help you for sure it's just you have to go to the wall to make it work there's obviously the ground one which I believe I already told you guys about I already made a video on just the ground chain dashes I'll cover that briefly in this video about this is mainly for the wall ones but the ground ones obviously it's pretty straight forward like what you see is pretty much what it is it's just jumping really quick quick wave - and you just keep going just keep on repeating the same action over and over again but I'll cover that in a second but for the wall ones the cool thing about it is it just like it's much quicker than the ground once you can see how fast it was right there and you do that across the whole wall it's much quicker than the ground ones and you'll see how easy it is to do yourself anyone can actually do this you could be lower-ranked and pull this off and there's a lot of different ways to do it as well there's no there's no set way to do it you don't have to wait - off the wall like I was there's a lot of different ways to do it so I'll tell you guys real quick but first I want to just cover the ground wave - take the ground chain - because you guys were asked me about chain - general sister just story on chain dashes in general and there's one thing you can do on the ceiling which I don't know how to do but I have seen freestylers do it but I will cover the ground ones and the wall ones so for the ground one so pretty much all it is is this if you guys don't know this if you just tap X you do a smaller jump and if you tap X twice you do two smaller jumps whereas if you hold X twice you do two really big jumps so for this ground - is you're just doing a mini jump and then too many jumps back-to-back so you see how low my car states to the ground and I can do a lot of really cool things with it over and over again so that's pretty much all it is is just your jumping way this decide really quick double tap bag so just keep brave - into the same side you look at my controller belief need help that's the whole idea of it it's just really really quick mini jumps just really hard at the timing of it but that's the whole idea of it all it is is a singular wave - to decide and you're jumping really quick again off your wave - that's why you'll see my car looks a little bit different than a normal wave - no more that's just like this what I'm doing is just a quick jump after my wave - she's done as well it's a double jump so there's a little idea of the the ground one and you can mix it up you could do the the back and forth little water wave test which I always thought like cool but again this was not crazy effective like it's not super useful and all honestly I don't use it much outside of when I'm just messing around I never really use this in a competitive environment but I'm taking it super serious but it's definitely a cool thing to know how to do and I think it's really fun to do especially in free play just to get a better idea of how to control your car it's just a really useful thing to learn so yeah all it is is just a really quick wave - and just trying to recover off the ground by using your your second jump by tapping extra really quick yeah that's the whole idea of the the ground chain - and I'll show you guys the wall one now so pretty much look at you so just a little quicker so a quick breakdown of that before you uh throw one just jumping and just the quick double jump of X and holding one direction you go back and forth with your left stick and it's all it is just repeat that that motion across the whole map so that's four four growling dashes and chain dashes now we want to do on the wall if you're trying to the wall chain - I'll show you guys what that looks like first that's pretty good example of what it would look like and it's actually really straightforward to do this it's actually probably easier to do this than the ground one because the gallon requires a lot of timing because get the time off your jumps when you do your next flip but for this all this is just spamming your your extra much and holding one direction and then you gotta kind of get lucky with the way you go up the wall honestly it doesn't really have much to do with your timing it's like partially luck but also you got to be able to be really fast at spamming your X button so the basic controls of it is you want to just go up the wall around here as soon as you're at this point you can push top right as you can see on my controller if you're on the right wall you push top right if you're gonna left for you to push the top left toward the wall that you're on and then you just get a spam X over and over again in that direction so you want to do it pretty much as soon as you land over here around this part of the wall this means you start as soon as it starts curving up to be a straight wall that's where you should start your your training - is you can actually mess with this quite a bit as well in actual gameplay you can kind of use it as a fake this is an example yeah you can make a little you're gonna swim up for a shot and they used to do a fake and you keep anything with the fake well the balls on the wall you just dribbling that's a good use for it pretty much want to only use this for in-game I'd say but in terms of just what it looks like again you want to go up the wall right around here and you're just spamming it toward the wall and spamming X exactly what I told you guys hold towards the wall press here your power side button and make sure your you're just spamming X as much as possible and you will mess it up sometimes I mess it up still I've done it quite a bit but you can do it a couple different ways you start off with a wave like this and then keep going into it you can start it off with just jumping onto the wall and then you just keep spamming like that so those are all the buns you need to pull this off but then it comes down to just learning like which part of the wall you can actually do this on you can also start off with a flip if you want to I used to do it that way and I thought that it was like super easy to do like when I first started so it all comes down to you really and whatever feels most comfortable to you because three races started pretty much jumping onto the wall like that with a flip you could just jump straight up onto the wall like that or you could do a wave - which sometimes works sometimes it doesn't but yeah those are the three ideas of how you get started off and then you just use those same few controls and there you go that's pretty much how you chain - on the wall there's not much to it really but it's a really cool-looking thing to do for sure and it does give you a little bit of extra speed I did do some testing on it it seems to give you a little bit extra speed over just going straight back if you're just driving straight back on the wall but most of the time you don't want to be doing that because you don't have the you don't have the ability to sit like super easily just go like this right if you're if you're just stuck chained dashing on the wall all the way downfield and you're just flipping onto the wall how you gonna turn around quick you can't right so there's not many uses to it honestly but it does look extremely cool and it's somebody that you guys should probably practice if you want to just mess with your car control or trying to get better understand the mechanics of the game and how just like dodges and stuff like that work especially the ground ones the ground was actually think do help you quite a bit I have used them before I like jump off the wall like this and I'll just do something like this five no boosts to go over to this boost I've done that before but there's a lot of uses for these stuff there's a lot of uses throughout the game to like throw these in here they're wavedashes on the ground definitely more useful than the wall but just learn to do in different ways and you'll be able to implement it in different ways into your game yeah that's the whole idea pretty much hope you guys have a better understanding of how to do your your ground chain dashes and your wall chain dashes now and yeah if you guys wanna see tutorial anything else in particular I can do one on double flip recess if you guys want I could try to teach you guys how to do like a proper double flip reset and what flip I'm doing how I'm doing this flip cancel stuff like that I can definitely I can definitely use that it's all up to you really let me know down below and I'll make more videos like this yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful date or night root of time watch this like comment subscribe us you guys all in the next on I love y'all peace you
