guys enjoy today's video yo what is up guys this video is going to be a little bit different and it's not exactly going to be for all you guys especially the higher level players um if there are a lot of you high level players watching this right now there are little things you can take from this there's little things that you might not know or you might not actually put into your game yet i would say this is going to be mainly for the players that are just starting the game mainly for the free to play players that are just getting the game brand new i'll be making two of these and there will be a bunch of little categories within each that i'll be trying to talk to you guys about um but this will be part one of a two-part video like i said yeah if you are new here and you do enjoy this video i have 800 other videos on my channel um about learning and just improving in rock league in general and i have a bunch of other montages if you want to watch some cool goals there a bunch of my tournament runs of the world championship that i won and all the other major line events that i've won so there's a bunch of stuff on my channel if you guys are brand new here um i hope you guys can go check that out and enjoy it um but people that always watch the people that are always stopping by these videos you know how it is here you've been here for a while um so yeah we're just going to keep on releasing this concert for you guys try to help you improving rocky that's always been the goal of this channel and we will have fun videos here and there like we always do but for the most part i'm always going to try to help you guys improve that's what this channel has always been uh for that's the whole purpose of it that's why i made it try to help you guys improve and give you guys the tips that i didn't necessarily have and i was trying to improve at the game so start off for today i'm going to go over dribbling i think that this skill is something that is very underrated to learn early on so my brother is going to be using an example a lot in this video he's somebody that when he got this game i try to teach him a lot of little things and he actually got good at fast aerialing which i'll go over in the next video there's something that a lot of players don't even know like in mid diamond like halfway up the ranks so he got good at faster everything within his first 50 hours because that's one of the things that taught him and he had a huge advantage in speed right away so i taught him his mechanics super early and he was able to just fly through the ranks that's the whole idea of this uh this video for you guys is to try to teach you as many things as early as possible so you can just fly through the ranks because it's gonna be tough for some of your newer players gonna be running into players that have played this game for a while so knowing these things are gonna help you straight off the bat so let's start off with uh with dribbling so the first i'm gonna go over guys is dribbling and what i wanna say just before getting into any mechanics if you're brand new to the game hop in free play and just grind free play free play is your biggest asset don't jump into ranks straight away because it's going to be tough you don't know what you're doing and you might get the moralized because people will be better than you straight off the bat so what i will say is that no matter what mechanic i'm teaching you guys here it's going to be hard for you to just pick up a controller and do it off of what i'm telling you you have to get a feel for it there's nothing even me for someone who has a very large amount of time playing this game um i can't see a mechanic for the first time and just do it instantly right it's gonna take time and i have to have a feel for it so what i will say is you can see me doing this you can see what i'm doing you can see the idea of it that the ball can bounce on your car like it looks simple in theory but you're gonna try and i guarantee you'll be doing this uh you'll break too early it's gonna fall off your car you won't have an idea of how to control it's gonna fall off your car so it's just i've had a lot of time playing this game i understand how to control the ball and it's not gonna be easy if you guys fit away so take time every mechanic is gonna take time so i would say roll the ball to yourself is the best part to practice dribbling most important thing and just try to get a little pop-up and just try to stay on that you don't even need to boost don't get boost involved because i think as soon as you get boost involved you start losing uh possession of it and it becomes too difficult so what i recommended to um to a couple of people that asked me how to start learning how to dribble is just that will the ball to yourself slowly get on the other side of it which is good because you practice your flipping and you're boosting as well get the other side of it pop it up once and just try to drive into it take off ball cam as well when you're dribbling that's a massive thing that'll help you out if you take out ball cam um if you're dribbling with ball cam look how it looks see how it goes all over the place and if you're not experienced dribbling at all the ball like moving left to right like this over and over again is going to really mess you up because you have to counteract your stick every time the ball goes behind you like that it's very it's very confusing if you're not used to it so don't use ball cam you see how much easier it looks and i'm using ball cam off that's what you should be trying to do but the whole idea of dribbling is to try to keep the ball right in the center of your car so pretty much you see where the little little engine pops up on the octane you want to have the ball bouncing right in front of that that's that's the sweet spot for keeping your dribble balance right there you can see it's pretty much on top of the engine part um but the middle of the ball like the center of mass of the ball is a little bit in front of the engine and i'm just tilting my stick down so you guys can see kind of where it's supposed to be balanced the biggest thing though if the ball is coming off a high bounce and you're trying to catch it use this white indicator that's on the ground i don't need ball cam long because i can use the indicator and just try to get in the middle of the indicator that's that's the main thing for catching the ball um every single pro will take off ball cam when they're about to dribble something because it just makes it way easier i'll get into flicks um in another video maybe a more advanced tutorial but these are all uh beginner tutorials but that's pretty much the whole idea of dribbling though there's not like a crazy amount to it it's just a matter of getting a feel for it so roll to yourself pop it up make sure ball cam's off and try to keep the ball as centered as possible that's the main thing and uh one thing i will say that will help you with this is go to your camera settings right now and you can switch this to what i'm using but try to find a good balance of camera space that you enjoy changes from default from default you'll have a camera shake on probably take that off um you want to make your field of view 110 distance anywhere between 270 and 290 i'm gonna give you guys the pro ranges right now between 270 290 height use between 90 and 110 uh angle use negative five to negative three stiffness use 40 to 75 i want to say some people use more but that's like the sweet spot i use 60 right now swivel speed use whatever you want this is just how fast your right stick moves your camera around to look left and right or around you uh transition speed you want to have this so it doesn't just completely give you a headache every time you switch your ball cam on and off if you have it at two it'll pretty much be so instant that it's just snapping on and off the ball you don't want that you want to be more gradual um because it just won't give you a headache mid game so i think the more gradual look of 1.2 feels good uh so yeah find your your camera settings guys and also it's all preference but find your steering aerial sense controller dead zone and dodge the most pros use 0.05 and for aerial and steering stance i'd say the average is probably 1.3 or 1.2 for both and dodge that zone most pros use 60 or 70 70 or something like that that's what the majority use uh so those are your ranges you guys should use between there i'd say if you're brand new put those on it's already gonna make your game feel much better um yeah that's about it for video settings straight off the bat i'll just say that most pros use nothing on uh helps the game feel a lot smoother max fps 250 obviously and that's about it for video settings so change those things and uh that will help you with dribbling ready because if you have a camera shake on i should have mentioned that before the drilling part but if you have camera shake on every time the ball like bounces on your car like that you see those sparks when i move left and right that's going to make your camera shake so you want to have that off and that's a default setting i think the game comes with i'm pretty sure i don't know if they changed that but just make sure that's off if it's not um yeah i'll go over different kinds of flicks in another video i just wanted to go over the basics of dribbling and like the idea of having the ball in your car and controlling it because in lower level lobbies if you're just if you just got the game just being able to do this if you just drive with the ball left and right whenever you want to that alone is a skill that's like super important to learn but yeah i'd say that's all i can really tell you in terms of dribbling the rest is all feel for it like the idea of turning left you're gonna be more on the right side of the ball turning right you gotta be more on the left side of the ball it makes sense right it's just common sense but you have to have a feel for it so i'll go over flicks in another more advanced video but that's it for dribbling i don't want this video to be crazy long but i'm going to go over some some tips you guys might not know so i'll leave a bunch of aerialing stuff for the next part of this i don't want to get into it in this video but for part two i'll definitely cover like fast earlying i'll cover how long you have your dodge for um i'll cover stuff like that but i do want to cover a little tip here that when you're in the air a lot of people don't know this it's just like an unknown type of tip so i'm gonna go on this line right here i'm gonna jump and i'm not gonna hold r2 and i'll show you what it looks like i'm just gonna press jump see how they don't move at all a tip that a lot of people don't know is when you're holding r2 in the air if you jump and hold our two in the air it actually counts um as if you're boosting but it's not as fast obviously so let me hold r2 when i'm jumping so i actually ended up in front of the line i'm gonna do it again i'm gonna do it again i'm actually going to make it all the way past this line just r2 and the air nothing on the ground so you see how much that actually can help you so that's a little tip that i wanted to give you guys a lot of you guys don't know about that i wanted to cover that in this one because i'm going to go over recovery as well and the big tip on recovery that i'm gonna be telling you guys for the newer players and for players that might not know this is always make sure you're holding your drift button when you land my drift fund is l1 and the reason why i can land like this like backward and just keep my all my momentum is because i'm holding my drift button the whole time so if you don't hold a drift button you land like this look what happens if you hold a drift bunny and land sideways you could just keep going straight after so the biggest thing for recoveries and where every single pro does is always holds their the drift button no matter how you land and you're gonna be able to keep going full speed always so that's a huge tip to to match together with the r2 one because even though it's a little different if you're jumping you want to be holding r2 because it's going to give you more speed forward right and you can also do the same thing backward same thing applies if you want to go backward quicker in the air hold l2 and you'll see the same thing see how it brings me backward a lot of people don't know about this so i thought i'd bring it up it's something i found a long time ago and i'm sure a lot of people know about it but for people that don't it's an important thing when it comes to recovery and being an air in general holding your your drift as soon as you're about to land for recoveries and um yeah just making sure that you always land under your wheels as well which honestly that's gonna take time again it's gonna take time you have to feel for you know how the game feels in general so i would recommend putting your um your controls non-default because the default controls are tough to get a hold of the easiest switch that i'd recommend and the thing that i did as soon as i changed my controls back in 2015 i switched my arrow to l1 my default arrow to l1 and my drift to l1 as well that way when i'm airlording the air i go for a ball arrow as soon as i land i can hold my drift button and keep my momentum right i could do both very easily because we're on the same button so that's why i recommend that that binding so that's something i'd recommend for you guys um but yeah the obvious thing that this one a lot of you guys are gonna know obviously but the brand new players won't know always try to land on your wheels so air rule to land on your wheels at all times if you're jumping off the wall like this make sure you land on your wheels jumping off the wall you better land on this wall make sure you always end on your wheels you're gonna have the maximum amount of speed if you land on your back like this you can actually recover and you're falling for a while right so always make sure you land on your wheels and always make sure you hold the power side those are two massive things when it comes to just trying to you know keep your momentum at all times those are the two things i wanted to cover when it comes to momentum and uh like a little secret tip you guys want to know about the r2 thing and else you think um now the big thing for brand new players that i think would instantly help a lot of you guys when you get this game is don't waste your boost guys so here's some tips about boost that you guys should know it's gonna be the last thing i'm gonna cover for this video i want this video to be too long because it is a two-part so i'll cover the rest of the big things in the next one but um let's go over the boost real quick so obviously as you can see 100 boost there are these these little pads and then there's the big pads there's six big pads one two three on each side and there are a lot of little pads i don't even know the exact amount but there are a lot of little pads um and the big things to know are the respond times so if you take one of these big boosts it's going to be 10 seconds to respawn if you take one of the little pads it's gonna be four seconds to respawn so keep that in mind especially if you're in a position where you have no boost so say i waste all my boost i'm trying to take none of the little pads if you have no boost and you're back like this you can very easily take one two three four five right here on defense you don't have to leave for the big pads and this one will be back by the time you get around because it's four second respawn so little ones are actually really good to pick up because look how quickly i just maxed on my boost i didn't have to take myself out of the play at all if i ever needed to i can go for the ball right so memorizing the spawn one two three four it's gonna be back memorizing the spawns of the little and the big one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten memorizing the spawns for both little and big boost is pretty important that way you can have a mental note of when they're gonna pop up but that's not everything guys you can know the spawns but you can also waste your boost at all times so one of the biggest tips for managing your boost and conserving it is as soon as you see these purple lines behind you as long as you stay in one straight line you'll never have to use boost ever so you can just flip get super sonic this is called supersonic and you never have to use boost ever you could stay in one straight line and save all your boost so what i like to do is if i'm just landing from like their backboard if i just land right here for example i'll just flip down the middle and i'll just stay super sonic i don't have to use any boost and i can pick up whatever pads i need i'll be back full boost that's what i like to do going back but just remember that as soon as you see this purple lines you only have to boost if you're turning as long as you never turn you never have to boost again but if you turn look i lose it right so just get into the habit of only boosting if you have to turn a bit but i still keep it the whole time look how little boost i'm using see how little boost i'm using and i'm able to keep my speed the whole time i can still have full boost pretty much around the whole map keep my speed so that's a a really important skill to learn early on i think so you don't waste your boost but in general you don't want to waste your boost unless there's a serious opportunity you don't want to just see the ball jump up but they're way closer to the ball than you are and you just jump full speed at it and then miss and we saw your boost now you're stuck you don't know how to recover so you're stuck going back with no boost you don't take any pads going back right so make sure you take your your pad lines going back and make sure you hold on to your boost at all times so guys a lot of these tips will be for the brand new players like i said but there's a lot of stuff that you could take from high level play and try to put into your game play even if you're not capable of the mechanical side of things just trying to be smarter and not like hitting the ball away for no reason that stuff in general is super important to learn and to just embed into your brain early on so like i said guys i do have 800 other videos on my channel of just raw gameplay and trying to teach you guys stuff throughout the gameplay and i will be doing stuff like that for pretty much forever uh with this channel so there'll always be videos for you guys to learn from so if you guys do enjoy and you're brand new here make sure you do drop a subscription and i'll be going over a couple other things in the next part of this video which will be released i think in two days or so um so definitely look out for that and i think i'll be covering uh positioning fast airling uh how to half flip that's a big one that's one that's gonna help you out massively early on uh something that you should definitely learn which is just this um but i'll go over that in the next video and uh wave dashing i'll teach you guys that as well it's just this is what this looks like that's how you can get full speed doing this and again it's a little bit advanced for like a beginner someone just got the game but it's not a hard skill to grasp at all so yeah i'm covering that uh rotation positioning faster than half flipping and wave dashing will be the next video so you guys can watch that and learn all those things but yeah today we went over uh just basic recovery skills of holding your drift button whenever you can change all your your camera settings and controls to somewhat similar to what the pros are using i gave you guys the ranges of what all the pros are using that's a huge help that i definitely did not have back then uh when i started playing that's something that'll help you out  off the bat just what pros are using but yeah there's infinite amount of videos i can make about things i can teach you guys and replay reviews and stuff like that so like i said let me know what you guys want to see down below i have no problem doing different kinds of like tutorial videos or like whatever you guys want to learn i'm down to talk about i'm down at the replay reviews um whatever it is i want to teach you guys i want to make you guys feel comfortable in your rank game so so yeah it's gonna be off this one guys i hope you enjoyed i'll be uh covering the second part in two days so check out the channel in two days every other day i upload on this channel that's my schedule make sure you check out the channel every other day at 1 pm there's always an upload here um or just subscribe put your notifications on and it'll always tell you when i upload that way you never have to open your your thing up at 1 pm est every time so all right that's going to be off listen guys i appreciate you i hope you guys enjoy the video even though i know a lot of you guys already know this stuff there's gonna be a new bunch of players that are here learning brand new stuff so i gotta be gotta be fair to everybody here right so let's make uh another good part two video and hopefully you guys can learn some things even the the older players um but yeah let me know what you guys thought down below and i'll see you on the next love y'all peace you
