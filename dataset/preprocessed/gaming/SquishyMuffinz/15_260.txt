up guys gonna be playing some solo queues for today let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's go all right the first game playing against ss and all right well we'll see this goes not sure what to expect this q took quite a while and it's pretty late at night right now but we'll see we'll see this goes should go up i'm not gonna go for this though he's on the wall already so i might as well wait for his touch maybe double there we go it's good patience on the the second touch there not to expect their hit to go through i'm already up for it might as well try to complete the double no reason not to and they both ended up missing so we'll take it said chill me all right also my settings will look a little bit different i'm messing with something right now i'm not sure if i'll stick with these but it's within the the ranges that i gave you guys in the previous video and yeah this game is going to be an interesting one i can already tell i could definitely already tell but uh winnable definitely one of my teammate unlucky area they ended up ongoing let's take our time with this it's gonna be internet i did not realize my teammate turned toward the ball as well there oh so i wouldn't even know when but it's okay we're get we're getting used to figuring this game out already figuring out the lobby we'll see how this goes as it gets deeper and deeper into the game we'll learn how our teammate wants to play i might need to play a little more passive and when i have time just go for like an air dribble or something like that try to shoot low there we go let's get a shot back even 2-2 all right just got to watch out for the mistakes that may come through i'll go for the passive approach y'all fake i'll go now good luck teammate i can help if you need it seems you might need help so i just waited a sec there cut out the it's wall for them i'll hold on to my booster and just go back no reason to waste my boost i don't need to which i play forward might be in there we go let's get a play there around the whole team good 50 and then a good follow-up as well all right so i try to get this back left for him because he asked for the knee boost thingy i assume that means back left but they want to kick off i'm gonna wait behind for the 50. go for a double on this i'm trying to delay for my teammate because that touch going forward wouldn't have done anything i would have just gave them the ball so if i can get a double and kill some more time it's probably best bet there nice sick control eiffel boost now middle as well so whatever happens with this ball i could follow gotta watch out for the demo there yeah i thought my teammate would maybe recognize the situation and try to help me out after he's going for the demo because i was last back for a while there teammate should have probably oh he tried i was gonna try this backflip it's all good really tough spot for me to be in maybe should have just tried the big balls and hope for the best but it's pretty risky to do that most of the time there we go kept it just under the bar i know these settings look a little bit different than what you're used to seeing for sure they're a little bit unique but we're giving it a try there we go played under him wall and we have five goals this game has been quite messy in terms of defense just not fully working well with my teammate i'm not sure what he wants to do a lot of the time so a little bit awkward and it uh continues to be that way to me okay so here if i'm on the way back you should try to challenge for me i feel and leave the the booster the person is rotating back don't steal boost from your teammate because then they can't really assist you in what you're doing you're just playing for yourself at that point there's only an issue i have with that situation but again i could have done better there of course i didn't follow my teammates touched very well it was kind of hard to tell what's happening but we got to go back anyway right behind you should have one more am i guessing okay i don't want to go quite yet oh i couldn't get it bar down or now unfortunately i thought i was gonna be barred down and i'm back on the line again right behind me so here i'm trying to support it trying to just be in support if it gets over him it's fine i thought he didn't have another touch not a lot of danger here because i could just follow this wait for his touch you know i have one more teammates behind me i'll let him go the challenge i'm just going to fake him too much let me have there we go what a fake i let him stay with that i guess like a boomness potentially a goal i don't know if i can read it all right i was gonna boost still i'm gonna be still i'll take midway so it's fine teammate can go try to help me out put this back shut i got time for my teammate he's not back quite yet pass over to him double plus i'll have phobias midfield anyway so i can kill time for him i don't need to aggress for this quite yet oh i almost got it fast enough past him i'll let him get my boost he's rotating forward just in case he wants it i don't want to cut him off and take it i should probably leave it at that point though my teammate nice i'll turn middle of 30. if he wants to pass that's fine i'll be ready for the boom now there it's fine we're just blocking all the angles letting our teammate get a free ball every time that'll do i'm just gonna wait on left side try to block maybe should be good for my teammate maybe a shot i'll just wait close slightly unlucky oh i thought that was them going to be honest obviously wouldn't try to cut off my teammate like that just baiting there for the flick nice i missed let's kill it and there we go we finished with exactly a thousand points all right i could definitely score the last one there but it's fine it happens played fun oh game i feel like made some mistakes on defense just having trouble reading what our teammate wanted to do most of the time but exactly a thousand points shot exactly on the dot at that point i've actually never seen that but uh yeah let's get into the next game so you can keep it up let go let go all right so we got ourselves calm against atomic and t-monitor that's gonna be a tough one tom actually get a twos t-mon's up there as well been around for a very long time both of these players so we'll see we'll see if we can be done can't be upset at losing this one this late at night to be honest it's gonna be sweaty uh should have controlled that boy i i had a feeling a challenge for some reason so for the quick shot but i probably shouldn't have good save over one couldn't quite shoot the second so i went for the 50 instead and everybody had a good goal push it through as well played also i made a training pack for you guys that i want to make a video on i think it has a lot of really good shots for you guys to practice so that probably my next video we'll be on that uh that training pack i think it's super solid i hope you guys a lot it's a slightly more advanced for sure but it doesn't mean that you guys can't try to you know learn these things that are in the pack and put them into your your gameplay even if you're a lower level doesn't mean that at all you could try to do it whatever way you're comfortable doing it yeah i mean you don't need to try to do it the same way i'm going to show you guys but i'll show you guys how i made the pack for higher level players but you can definitely use it if you're lower level as well every shot there's multiple options the multiple things you could try to do i was gonna pass my teammates kind of stuck in a spot where he had to try to pre-jump and it was tough for a girl this really it's not much he could have done i want to throw this here try to focus for a bit trying to get a good 50 everyone that's close thomas is really good at just controlling the ball trying to get a 50 behind it every time you see right there that's what he did super solid doing that's pretty much just placed on twos trying to control as much as possible good place thought i have it's it's very dribble based game mode oh i gotta be careful on this the counter nice i should've been a gopro sorry's gonna get scored and it's fine though oh i thought he messed up his ariel at first i was good with him now got a really good challenge on me playing the way lots of backboard just in case you can get a follow-up my teammate you might be able to say on that it's really good good delay for me i'm gonna have that so i'll just wait should be finer nice i was a little bit scared 50. see if he misses which he might there we go how's he gonna play put it off the backboard in a spot where you couldn't get it just too fast of a hit and we followed it up well the good shot for the fake kickoff good read just trying to block that teammate should turn here it's a little awkward if he leaves that it's fine right for him helped him out a bit maybe a shot here oh we want to save obviously wasn't trying to save it like that but it worked yeah not much i could do that i was super unlucky to be honest the whole sequence because i would have been the goal for us i should have known for the shot i should have hit it around him although it should have been a goal for us it was just you know that unlucky thing that happened would have been avoided if i just hit it around him said i went for the shot we did have a lead right two teammates shouldn't really believe me in these kind of situations too much they're tough to defend over and over again but it's all good city can do plus shouldn't have that on the back wall try to go back here i don't want to get countered it's fine give him a lot of room to turn on this to get a boom i don't want to go for this he's ready up that's fine that's unlucky holy not a whole lot's going my way this game i won't lie to you but it's all good 50 seconds left if we lose this way you know it is what it is really sometimes things don't go your way and rocket league is just how it is nice a lot of times though if you do ever go for a touch on your back wall like that and someone else coming in it does just pinch really hard toward your net it was kind of lucky that i went straight in there but that's often what happens you know it should be pretty cool let's take my time put it away should secure the game there most likely unless we throw pretty hard here i don't know two their goals are pretty unlucky on our part so we should be fine got the block on him i should have i'm gonna go back nice that should be a goal as well damn i didn't get that boost either it's been a rough game man been one of those games the best way to to say it's been one of those games for sure off the wall all right gd's all around hope you guys enjoyed the games for today was a lot of fun and we got a really big deal at the end there that was a sweaty game to win ended up coming through with it yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or a night with retirement when you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys all in the next one i love you peace you
