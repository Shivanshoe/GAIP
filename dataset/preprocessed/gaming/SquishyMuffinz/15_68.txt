kick off the start take some time here wind up for a power shot all right well that was about as perfect as it gets really good way to to start off the game wow i was actually a very good shot surprised myself i'm gonna fake kick off here been a while since i've played once so it might be some really tough game say i'm not going to lie i don't think my picking off works anymore go read it you had 50 took my time here i didn't see him so i knew he's on my left side actually super unlucky that that was just straight in let me have to use a lot more resources than i would have liked that's a good shot good job to get it over him yeah sometimes stuff like that will happen in ones like a 50 goes into your net you're not expecting or touch off the wall like that or even just like a bad bounce unfortunately when that happens because it weighs so much of your resources right you don't want to have to waste your boost until you absolutely need to and that kind of stuff just makes you have to and you have no choice really let's take a shot here not to play calm there i know he's not gonna be able to double that right where that that ball was bouncing there's no way you could land double that time took my time jump to back wall got a good play out of it i'll follow myself here make the big touch i like this aggression from him a lot i had a feeling to fake it but in that situation it's so tough for me to do anything that's why the fake is the best thing there any kind of shot he knows i'm saving it from now on i'll be expecting the fake though so in a way it's a good thing to get scored on like that early on because you can use that to your advantage right to the side see he does here there we go ones is a lot like i feel like the calmer you play the more you wait for their mistakes and opportunities to present themselves the better you'll do than if you're trying to force the issue more often than not i don't have to commit here there's no reason to i could just stay under in a spot where it's going to be awkward for a fake jump make a weird form fix up again make him go one more time now i kind of have the advantage here miss the panic a bit leave the ball whatever it may be i'm just going to drive into this don't have to do anything crazy this is a good player too we're playing a good player and that was a super simple set of moves that i did there i didn't really do anything too crazy gonna be a goal against us i think i don't know if i can get back yeah there's no way to recover quick enough it's a good kick off from him i'm gonna try to slow down mine a little bit for a single jump here oh for the ball insta flick go for the boost as well be annoying better be annoying again it's fine it's not for my boost it's actually not a big deal almost time the the challenge really well there should be fun i'll play it around him it's a good 50 and i can get this boost probably i'll come back in time he loves to fake a lot there we go another opportunity where i'm kind of just waiting for my my chance to to get it out it's all ones is every time i played a really good ones player two it's often way more simple than made out to be i think no matter how good the player is you'll get goals out of the just looking for the the right opportunities one is a good way to make better decisions in terms of your challenges i think that's what it teaches you more of than anything because mechanically you can learn everything in free play in my opinion ones i guess will help you like learn how to use your mechanics actually beat somebody but at the same time it's fairly common sense i feel like it's a good shot good placement i think it's more about what you're committing for how you choose to challenge you know if you can actually recover off your challenges a lot of what once teaches you i think is actually important that stuff you can definitely um use in a team environment okay jump you're not going to go i just want them to jump and panic that way i can get this boost early got a flip here another flip it's safe from him take this boost make him panic again i should be able to win this ball as well let him hit that that's fine touch once be annoying here kind of just stay and be annoying same thing he shouldn't have much boost left i think if he does honestly good good on him he does so hard to tell how much boost he has because of that uh that boost he's using i couldn't actually tell when he boosted or not i haven't i've actually never seen that boost i'm not gonna lie all right that's a situation where like i have a three goal lead if he messes that up and he's just falling into my net with no boost either he saved that and i'm ahead by four now anyway me playing like super passive there is yeah it's riskier but that can pretty much secure me the game and if i get scored on then i can play a little bit safer off of it after it should be fun playing this barbie can't really follow it up easily and i got the boost which is big make the touch and he has to kind of respect that i can hit that right that's where it gets kind of awkward to take challenge early gonna make him flick all i did was turn just a little bit right and i made him flick it all right a big miss from him but at the same time it kind of helps him i feel like i would have had that play red i'm not going to fake challenge here i'm just going to instago all right fake challenge twice and then went so i wanted to switch it up but you could tell he's got play one plays ones a lot just the way he plays his pushes down field let him hit that it's fine it's 15 seconds left let's make a play quick this ball was pushed a little bit too far away from him i think so you can't actually shoot as long as i challenge the right time ah and stuff five seconds i'll tell you a good kick off here they went slow just kind of expected that's like probably the most obvious thing you could have done in terms of like a switch up on kickoff there but he still played well the whole game yeah good first one let's get to the next one so you can keep it up get back to back dubs for the day and start off our once placements the right way see how it goes all right we got guzz again here phone kick off here unfortunate 50. yeah i had a feeling you did something like slow like that or a little bit of a fake off one's really annoying with that stuff because here i was pretty much everything it actually just dictates the whole game right so if you just understand how to have a better kickoff in ones like understand how to make adjustments and stuff like that you're gonna have a huge advantage regardless of if you're even the the better or worse player nice a lot of times in high level ones like if you watch people play ones all the time that's really what decides the game it's just kickoffs and that's why i'm able to beat players that are extremely good at ones like even best in the world type status at once because if if you just have a better kickoff sometimes it all comes down to and sometimes get off so random so that's why i don't like the idea of ones and um you know if it really decides whether or not player is good or not which it shouldn't to people it's too i guess i don't know volatile is the right word but it just like feels random often let's take a shot here it's going to make him jump at the very least so what i want and that's something you'll find a lot that's honestly sadly way too true you can have super mechanical people like guys it's pretty mechanical they're pretty good on the ground but people probably don't play enough threes or modes where you need to be good at reading the backboard and there with stuff like that but he's going to do something really good here probably actually really could save very hard to get that situation probably the best thing he could have done there i play this a little bit safer more passive really good save wait for the bounce here should be able to get back i think just going for a bump on me yeah very like classic 1v1 playstyle yeah it's very bumpy low 50 you know it's not the most satisfying but it definitely does get you the wins if you do it right definitely not a very uh fun way to play though that's for sure i don't really enjoy going super like low 50 heavy in ones but it definitely works really well especially at the right times the smart way to play just let him panic a bit there we go trying to stay on the ball like a lot too in spots where you probably should just leave it give it the possession for the boost but it definitely does work sometime and that's if the opponent gives you a little bit of space right i'm trying not to do that he has that kick off right there oh we missed the boost that's really bad for him like i'll pay you to sit right there um a little wave dash very very good because you you keep a lot of uh control of the game super early on you see even though he missed the boost he still gets control wherever the ball goes to kick off pretty much the sides he gets to go almost always whoever gets this boost now is pretty much the the big thing on this possession got to get it around them i tried to go for something cheeky if i could have discord honestly go for some bumps on me now i'm gonna go for some more bumps on me let him panic a bit there we go also make sure you're using your right stick a lot and once it's a lot easier to keep track of where everyone is right just one guy so just simply looking you're unsure where someone's at very useful should be cool there we go taking advantage of him going a little bit too aggressive on these plays and trying to do a little bit too much i'm trying to switch up my kick off just a single jump should pop it once i don't know if it's fast enough that is try to faking off here i've only done it once i think might not expect it i got an instago though i'm gonna do that yeah it's fine that works really well actually of him to come to me play it around him play to the corner there we go again little usage of the the right stick helps a lot there gives me an understanding of how much time i have left before i can actually take the shot if i have to rush it if i can just take it slow all that kind of stuff nice click it as low as calm as possible all right good games for today i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and see us on the next one i love you peace you
