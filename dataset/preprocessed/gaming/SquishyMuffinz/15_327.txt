before we get into the video guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers and there's still 48.9% you guys who are watching my videos who are not subscribed so if you're one of those people please go down below the video right now press that subscribe button and also press the bell she always notified when I upload a brand new video I honestly can't thank you guys enough for all the support that you guys have been absolutely insane so thank you so much and I hope I'm not letting you down with any of the content that I'm releasing enjoy the video guys I love you go you know some guys are back with another episode of the road to grand champ red the visor Edition so let's go over and find our third random vehicle for the third episode let's see what we get and Takumi yo I'm down for Takumi and the boost is a bad this car is actually kind of though I'm down for this I actually had to queue me a lot so we'll definitely take that into the camera settings now and I really hope that we'll have some like high fov some like nice feeling camera settings cuz look this is what we're onto the last video and these are so bad dude the only thing that's decent about is you have a decent view of like the the left to right of the field but you don't have a view of up and down that's alright for when the ball goes up there you can't see it so hopefully we'll have some better settings let's look at that right now alright it's over field of view we got 60 to 110 we actually just got what 10 it just gave us 110 I literally I can't believe that I wasn't you say in the last video I'll be so down to forget what to never be some like decent settings I'd be able to see the whole field and like I can actually hit the ball properly the entire time we got it so I'm 100% down with that let's go 110 FOV our beautiful already now let's hope that our distance isn't terrible let's check out what our this is gonna be 100 to 400 and we got ourselves 344 distance 344 okay let's put that in game so that's gonna go up to 340 so we only raise our distance 10 up 10 since last video that's kind of hard this is already kind of hard to play with but I don't want to spoil anything yet the FOV fov kind of helps a little bit though the height now the high 42 110 and we got ourselves 100 height dude these settings are insane these cities are actually really good hold on I'm 100 if 1 we can get these settings when we're playing it's like grand champs that would be nice they're like close to grand champs now it helps so much cuz this is actually not bad not bad at all ok so let's see the thing is though that if we get zero stiffness look how quickly this is gonna be oh no no no Han tude on alright let's see so we're at the angle now so negative negative 15 to 0 we got negative 4 these are good settings what the hell I'm literally getting like almost my camera settings besides the distance that's kind of nuts this is crazy ok he's going to the game do you get negative for these actually look nice so far it's got a crazy ok stiffness so you're up to 190 stiffness that's not bad either dude this is actually nice what the hell okay we gotta hit some good goals this video we have to hit some good goals we got good settings we got it some good goals 97 the last thing transitions feel asleep yet 100 to 200 we have 1.7 it gets better it's less than 2 it's not gonna break our next completely but it stopped really fast but we'll take it not bad at all for the SETI's portion of things I'm super happy about these to be honest and I think we could actually pull off some good goals and our car is Takumi which I'm pretty sure is the oxalate box so maybe we can hit some some nutty goals let's see though we have a block on our head which is kind of annoying kind of gets a no wait a little bit and this ancient sound I don't know what it is but Jesus it's annoying it is so annoying anyway we got our settings actually guys one more time those are settings 110 field of view 100 height isn't bad at all like if the distance was like 270 these are like normal settings these aren't bad at all if that was the case but the distance is 340 that's what we're working with for today's video these are the settings let's get in to the games we have at a 10-play you're gonna play the rest of our placements to find our rink let's get into it let's see how it goes all right Lenny is someone with a pretty similar anymore into Kowalski analysis I still don't like I was snappy the transition speed is but alright it's going for the boost already this guy's much better know what I've seen alright we got off the wall it's crazy I want some of your booster you can really tell they're like actually sell it for going for it well you could tell like the game sense is better just by the booster go forward already we have good settings we're hitting a banger of a double tap so let's hit some good good as goals this video let's go for some flip reset some double taps some air double surge little bub subscribe for some cool goals we actually have the ability to now no way I read this Oh a challenge again alright we're going for double flip reset here imagine I'm I'm I'm back flipping oh I couldn't get the double I got too far away from me that would be the ultimate goal of this video is in a double flip reset on target I'll be practicing them lately and actually a lot of uses for it if you could do it consistently which I have been able to kind of get it down but with these settings it's gonna be a lot harder obviously let's go dude no way no I was just talking about a double flip he said I hit it on my first try like woah my second try but technically my first try that was insane do what with these sayings either nitor started practicing that like yesterday literally yesterday he gave up he's mad I would be mad to you let's go dude these are the camera settings dude that was not we look at that from his point of view I can't believe you ate a double flip reset I was talking about that would be the goal of the video we hit that and layers or second try or something that's ridiculous I just surprised myself man I started practicing these like literally a big probably have a combined like two-three hours of practice trying to go for these double flip presets like that and actually hear what I'm Saku me with the dumbest camera settings that's crazy I can't believe it hit that actually knows obviously by the time this video comes out I practice a lot more I'll probably much better at it but still ridiculous I'm gonna go into the replay and look at it from his POV cuz man that was nuts I'm so happy we hit that Jesus that's crazy man that's literally gold goal of the series so far easily easily go all the series obviously I've been able to do anything I was cool look at his POV though look how difficult it is to defend if you do it correctly I'll hit it up the wall pop it up one flip I flip under I get a second flip and then flip begin actually insane if you watch it from this POV you see the flips no stalls are used for this you just flip onto it again it's another flip right there alright let's get into the next one I don't know why it's saying that we haven't played any matches yet we have obviously let's get into it we have two more left I think see if we can get some more cool goals I can't believe that man that's that's so crazy so double flip reset is checked off we got that done we're 831 mmm are now playing is 777 mmm our play hmmm thought that I'm a bones I don't even hit that the ultimate trol goal would be this is my idea for a while now you start on your side I don't know I'd never be able to hit this but you start on your side with the ball like this hey let me just roll toward the goal and then all you do the whole time is just bump just like that all the way until the little rolls in that's the ultimate trol goal nothing would be more satisfying I did not know it so nice alright see we can do pinch we hit these we hit these I'm reading ever reading him he's not gonna expect me to be up for this yo wait why is it so hard to turn in how did I get a double flip beside these settings been their attorney feels weird oh wait we're losing I thought I scored already it's so hard to turn good shot though you could tell those speeds increasing every single game the speeds increasing I think we're in a place of like Diamond something I'm guessing right into this alright let's go for a dribble classic era trouble until flip reset no flip there no way didn't get a flip oh oh I've had a football for him bang actually good challenge room to catch me off guard there the only thing is if you challenge somebody that you have to have the booster cover here and you didn't have that ooh wait I'm about to do it all hmm I wanted that to be one of those pinches men but I can't judge like how far my quarters from the ball one of the ground pitchers that just blasted I'm gonna fake going forward back out he's gonna the wall I'm a medium who should come back up and it's sick oh no I believe I really have to pay for that new you have to wrap around that pretty hard to get a shot the first wave has got him off-guard I guess we should come back in a sec there we go this is the play fake him never mind all right reversed your blame him no dude it's so hard see that's so hard to do with that setting this way the settings like they're not bad the only thing is when I'm turning I'm so used to being a little more wiggly because everything feels so stiff it's just like there's 90 stiffness huh no one won the double flip you said again man the 90 stiffness plus the transition speed being so high feels like everything just happens so stiff it's weird let's go dude we're hitting some some nutters not bad at all could have been better not bad though I'm still super happy with that trouble 47 easily title of the video right bump me up again waiting bacon Oh Bobby him again lady go in mmm there you go all right after you should have one more game to go and then I'll put us into I'm assuming diamond and then I have us right and then we'll only have to get through diamond one two and three I don't even know maybe I'll start in like dama - I have no clue to be honest but love to get through diamond and then we have champ one two or three so let's use it to go by pretty quick to be honest depends how many points we gain and we play against and if we lose like if we end up losing to a higher ranked player which I think we will if we get some really bad settings then obviously it's your gonna go on longer let's say I like got your position on the backboard day I was good that's all you want to be for those to give yourself the best chance of saving it Gigi though Kurama a playbook for sure oh I bought me Dewey and one more in us we won't marinus I believe well played well played 38 more points gained from that so if we win the next one we should break into 900mm are already which is insane actually yeah we play that that was a that was a plat three player at 777 MMR so we're into diamond right now that's actually nuts so already into diamond and we might get into the diamond two or three we'll see if you win the next I don't know what 900 MMR would be but yeah you said I think you bring me up three times at least I'm gonna say sorry alright next game let's go last game of the video let's see what we play set alright funniest 859 mm our player well sure this his he looks solid he knows how to bang a shot on goal I'm really glad to be having good settings for this matchup because this one's gonna be a hard one to win I think I could tell steak challenge it made me get the ball way that's a problem I don't have a very good view of what they're doing is trying to miss that actually good read I don't the greatest view of what they're doing in front of the ball with the fake challenge me I kind of have to give it away with these settings alright this is the one right here I mind he just going smart play I like it you know call it ball chasing caller you want he's staying on the ball he would no beast sure some may choose to be annoyed by it you know do you but he's staying with the ball to keep pressure I respect it obviously he's not mad knows how to play 1v1 so it's gonna be a interesting game it's probably a higher rank TV 233 player and he's just playing ones now as well good till there's a good understanding of the mechanics of the game how fake challenging work stuff that luckily demos are just broken though like a pleated broken and yet whole ten seconds to kill to you know whole ten seconds after you kill someone to square up today obviously over-exaggerated is three but feels like ten seconds in one big one I afraid Oh kill me I'm afraid again that was hard each pack dude you totally give me that off the bounce here we should go to get something they're mine holy my camera just got so disoriented I'm probably blending in quite well actually does it get a recovery off of that bomb or no way much I beat him in here there we go taking him oh I didn't fake it by the way over there I just missed I can't control my turds my turns and this is so janky bro hard to explain when you're used to the stiffest I'm used to and you go all the way up to 90 with distance this far away it's very hard to explain how that affects your turning but it does a lot somehow I hit a double flip you said on this I still don't know how I'll never know how Oh Oh save the ball a little too fancy there oh you missed by quite a bit i'ma pop it once I pop it again i'ma pop it there mom I did want to pop it at third time but you just went for it I could have just scored I don't know why did you shoot you fed us up in a bad spot you just take challenging little circles which you don't really want to do it's probably that because you leave like a good two second period or you can just shoot it let me go down here I let a panic bang I'd love to give me like stuff I don't know something about it it feels like a toy car but where you just look at it it's so cute oh oh no that's so bad yeah I could look what you missed oh good I could actually lose though this game he's solid oh that's good actually I kinda want to die Loki it's being back a beast a fake challenge am I so hard to save those dude on these settings at least hmm let's go pretty much secured that wooden I think well not really sorry two goals in what we want but I don't think we'll mess up our kiosk a bad yeah we got it all right now I want to go for some some more cool stuff last 40 seconds but he's funny saw it I think he knows when to keep pressure with no boost which is a really big skill to have him one we want obviously that's probably something he's learned from other modes because I don't think this dude's only played one we won and he's only this low rank he's too solid like too good system of mechanically so like I'll only I played once the dude must be playing twos downside at the age as well yes decent game sense as well so he's probably grandchild I'm guessing in like in twos or threes your slinger yeah somebody's challenges and stuff like to me he's playing better than like everyone we've played in the road to Grand shape it's Huey to you anymore solved in those players bang the finisher I was the one I was a good flick I still finish as well all right let's see what rank we finish off it will plead Bhutan they forgot over 900 MMR with that so see where that puts us we're still undefeated between both rody Grande chips you really gonna try to keep that up obviously diamond to Division three okay okay okay so only got diamond that two three champ one two three to go before we get to grand champs oh it's not that far away really when you think about it like that so let's keep it up up you guys enjoy I hope you guys enjoy the double flip recent man I was super happy if that Jesus I wanted to show you guys one of those suits I've been practicing those for a little bit they're super nice to hit in game I've hit two of them in game three of them now with that one but two of the other ones I hit in game were against like pro players your grand champs so it's like obviously you can't really compare the two but it's like still hitting any game is so satisfying and I want to show you guys what it was like so we actually got one in game with like three hours of practice which is really nice with terrible camera settings in it to cue me so super happy about that obviously and I hope you guys enjoyed the video in general we reach diamond to Division three after I replacement for the super dope still undefeated in series which is awesome we're obviously gonna try to get the grand shamble doing this and be undefeated so hopefully we can do that yeah because enjoying the series as much as I am I'm having fun recording this and I hope you guys get so I noticed that you guys enjoy my concept most when I'm enjoying recording my content and you could tell when I'm enjoying it most of the time and I do enjoy recording most of my stuff but series like this really getting me excited like just make me want to record more than just playing like regular ranked games would so that's why I obviously my Energy's gonna be a little bit different you guys probably gonna enjoy a little bit more and get more my personality out of it which is what I don't want obviously so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I can't wait to get into the next one and see what diamond 2 and Beyond holds for us and hopefully we keep up the wins even though it's gonna be really difficult and we have no control over what camera says we're gonna get but yeah appreciate y'all again if you want to try the camera settings for yourself they actually weren't too bad this video but if you want to try them out that's the settings that we got from the random number generator yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful night or day whatever time it is right now when you're watching this thank you follow support guys from the road to 1 million subs and you guys have been absolutely insane and getting this closer and closer to every single day and before we know it we're gonna be a 700 K on a year which is just ridiculous so thank you so much guys I love y'all and I'll see you on the next
