yo what's up guys today's video is going to be a little bit different so pretty much i'm going to be playing some 1v1 games and musty is going to be trying to tell me what to do throughout those 1v1 games he's pretty much going to be trying to tell me my every single decision so i'm going to be playing with my mechanics with musty's brain pretty much so we're going to be trying to do as much as we can in game while following musty's instructions so we might lose some games here and there it can be fun though either way so let's get straight into it let's see if we can get some dubs see how it goes squashing me wait no way wait what no way squashy muffins g2 he has a high ping all right so yeah go for the kickoff uh you gotta go for the ball nice okay see what he's doing he's going back so you have a bounce uh just go to half field and flick it oh he's going okay i'm trying i'm trying to wait for you but he's just going it's so hard he's away i would have definitely thought of that too yeah yeah but he just ends the challenges okay that's good you could let me know about like fake kickoffs and stuff too if you want me to do this yeah uh shoot shoot oh no okay now this is so hard a fake challenge and then go now go now go now nice big boost big boost and like two two bound triples and then shoot okay i'll follow the rules nice save okay get boosts oh okay you're playing ball it's fine okay okay you're gonna spawn on the left oh you're even telling the game to do uh okay jump jump jumps i waited for you those are always hard to see yeah i'm not trying to lose the squashy muffins g2 yeah yeah he's gonna screenshot that for sure yeah 100 all right uh i can't see where he is okay big boost yeah yeah and just wait for shot waiting for a shot i got one for you i feel like i wouldn't have done that like i don't know how to put it into words i wouldn't have actually waited for the shot yet no no i know yeah it's really dude i couldn't do it we should do a video the other way around he's going uh to take it up and then flip reset no you can't just air 50. nice yeah it's like we should do one the other way around two see so i can see how hard it is nice okay play ball play ball okay that's tomorrow get boost and then i don't know what he's doing i literally don't know what he's doing i can't tell you dude okay you can probably try shot here it's kind of risky okay you got the bump though uh try to get the mid boost if you can and see what he's doing okay 50 50. no way he destroyed me ah he destroyed me on the 50. he's huge how am i supposed to beat myself upgraded and let's see oh no i trolled i trolled that's not a sign too much threes get the corner boost get the coin reviews uh ceiling challenge just ceiling kind of shut up ah no i would have faked that thing i think i would have normally faked on the ceiling and it went [Applause] up is it myself nice wait come on squishy come on let's go okay it's been it's been a minute and i've played one it's been a minute hold on i need i need to unrustify this guy's crazy okay i'll probably give uh i would have gotten back through there yeah go go lay back all the way back and then like apply pressure but don't actually go nice dude this guy is he's the perfect player he's the perfect player he didn't flick early and he waited and oh that was smart all right we got two minutes got two minutes let's see okay get boost and do something off the ball if you can it's like kind of safe but kind of smart as long as you can get a good recovery we should come back let's play small no way oh no it never came i got it's back now yep unfortunately unfortunately i'm not gonna lie i'm overthinking every situation so hard because i feel like i'm i'm waiting i'm waiting for what to do but at the same time i like my brain just like wants to do something else it's such a hard thing but it's actually so interesting i don't know it's such a weird feeling nice and i don't know if he's back or not so just do whatever oh god things come out i don't know this guy is insane what is it no he is the one's main you could tell look at the turns nice get the boost and you got to get back pretty quick you're trying uh fake ceiling fixed aiming fixing he's gonna expect what you did last time see yeah nicely i'm taking the boost yeah that's more that's more he's really low here i just gotta try to let him do this thing all right and get the corner boost if you can no boy cheese dude all right gotta get past this or something uh so preset just try playing aj oh like what is this honestly it literally could be uh just flick nice and nice get his corner and get his corner thank god i would have gotten this corner yeah yeah you can anymore just wait okay now you have to pre-jump nice and science all right all right that's it we're coming back he just goes bro he's crazy dude all right maybe maybe we need to throw in some more dribble bumps and the commands here yeah he's been so aggressive yeah you beat me corner abuse you just have to try to save it you guys insane though taking the beast from them all right if i get a chance to give you an air drop bump i'll i'll grant that power to you should we fake this oh possession nice that's nice uh yeah do it adb adb yeah you can't i i don't know it's just weird abby uh you got a fake yeah i'm gonna say goodbye for a boost oh he's playing he's playing weird you just gotta do your dude this guy is the perfect perfect ones player the perfect one player it's still possible it's not possible you can't have goals just pretty much playing play normal if you have to he's gonna he's one he just wants it more wait maybe not do something dang it look at him he's good oh he's pinching who is this literally is aj or something man he's definitely a ones man you could just tell the way he plays is way too confident or playing anybody else i think we win that we wouldn't play anyone else i want to see who that guy actually is i feel like it's the smurf like you know what i mean squishy muffin gt that's like a oh yeah for sure it's a smurf oh no same map it's the one we can beat a goated ones player with this and try a demo like touch it and do that man unfortunately unfortunately okay get your boots done get demoed dodging demo nice might as well get the other piece and just wait okay uh hook shot try a little hook shot if you can i'm here oh no i'm saying like touch it oh okay okay okay i'm falling for where yeah yeah okay yeah i just stopped trying to go nice open convert first time nice good time yes sir he tries to flip reset every ball every single ball the ones player special our defense is the biggest call you gotta make you gotta be big brain on the defense calls on those i'll try to like let you do what you do naturally almost like i'll try to mainly tell you what to do on offense yeah i tried imagine that one straight in though supposed insane okay your boost and then just wait to see what he does like okay okay uh air triple bump or it's like irritable or whatever you think would be best nice control your jump [Laughter] thank you i hate this fake ceiling thick ceiling he's probably going to read it though yeah good luck nice let's shoot no boost i still got it i think nice good shot man this is this guy's hard to play it might be a lot of aj it's just like flippy setting every ball off the wall and four key same play style i just faked no no i i i told you to fake but no one heard it oh that's what it was okay yeah you got possession uh try like a 45 degree flick around half kilo there we go no way i thought it was uh you got away from his wife yeah yeah yeah all right oh i should have actually bigger brains see that's something i wouldn't have done he's got he's going asap you gotta go you gotta go yeah i can reach all right we still have the lead though oh no back you go uh get corner boost and you think about going really quick uh i don't know i don't know i just literally don't know because it's good like the mind games uh spawn trap if you can dim with that man again down a little bit i just did that it had like frustration yeah uh bring it back kind of oh god dude this guy is perfect he's perfect yeah how about on defense just like literally do what you would normally do okay i'll just tell you what to do uh try like a weird wall shot here if you can vanessa what the heck what's up behind me oh my god he's going still it's going up no okay okay yeah this is way for bounce paper bombs about her dribble i'm gonna save it i want to save nice wave dash flip okay he's awkward exactly nice get the beast hi i wouldn't have thought to do that in that way would you have gone for the boost there normally yeah you've done that exactly yeah yeah i would have like gotten the boost but i just felt like that wasn't scorable but you went into car cam that was smart that's good okay get boost and then like kind of cut it and we might against the challenge okay uh powershot shot nice oh we're feeling it now we're feeling it now placement i had to backflip for the recovery but it works it works i don't want to give him the ball uh this is literally fork you yeah let him do his thing don't don't don't don't trust okay nice he's gonna go he's feeding you it makes you have to wait the last second so and just like fake something so he doesn't have perfect control like yeah nice watch the bum watch phone nice shot you get it oh he's saving it he might no this guy's literally opie get his boost nice that was good that's good just hit it high hit a high hit high nice and then think i would do what you would normally do i can't tell what this man is doing bro okay free shut up again oh yeah oh no this dude literally is you he knows your place though uh right side right side oh my god you got a clipper or something you picked him 11 times i would have taught that right and he would have saved my shot no you're so smart here trying to try to get on your car unless he goes okay you can just 50. [Laughter] no right away right away it would have been yeah i know exactly that's why it's tough for the delay that would have been the right move i just couldn't do it and fake challenge and then right after the fake challenge go um no that was the right play too but i feel like it's just there's like a split second of the delay that makes it not right if that makes it like it's so close it would have worked all right we've got a three goal question uh and then my corner boost just flick it instantly he's gonna like rush this flight this way nice and then bumper get his boost that works honestly like it's simple i think right now starting now like right when you get the ball just like do something insanely like a flight or something because he's gonna have to be really aggressive he's probably gonna go for this so try to just pop it over him nice he's got a good recovery no one missed get get corner abuse and then honestly yeah let's go okay get back in his corner boost again okay other than the officer that's good it's gonna be a medium can you get it nice it should be game all right we could get him again yeah yeah we close up here we have to win the best of three though we're gonna win the best yeah he won the first unless he's scared he might stop uh nah no way no way he wants the third oh this guy's good all right okay but i think he's more of a normal player yeah he is you have to be fine all right let's see let's see he messed up his kickoff looks like okay uh get right boost and then oh you have to wait oh god it's lagging for me just playing normal okay okay okay i'll stop watching i'll start watching let me know it's it's still the laggy yeah we might have to chop this game i'm not saying i could just forfeit i don't really care that much to be honest oh my god hopefully it doesn't same guy all right nice all right okay so far it seems better uh you gotta play ball here nice good boost uh take a shot as soon as you can i shouldn't have dumped all right uh you gotta get uh not another nothing right really not oh what is that bounce uh okay you're gonna have to go really close up and take the challenge let him hit it to you smart at 50 to 50 to 50 should be annoying being nice keep 15 15 okay get boost nope i got bumped somehow corner b i'm going for the ball and fake challenge okay he's going anyway you should have possession he's really really okay that's fine get your own boost but watch the bomb you've got to be careful i'm so used to playing the other dude man touch touch and then shoot go perfect timing should be hard to shoot though yeah i would just uh they yeah have 21 boosts here so does the same thing though it's gonna be the presets he doesn't really have a super good angle oh my god don't get clipped on oh my god oh my god that's why i don't play one dude they're all flip reset players oh my god i swear it's all they do you're you're on tick tock you're literally on the for you page oh my god that was a good shot though uh you gotta you gotta try to start some up here if you can't yeah that's it that's it bro look he's going he's so confident oh wait a minute i hope you have the sauce oh my god it's a free stuff that recovery though was that like luck did you mean to like hit that again i i got lucky the way it bounced but i meant to hit it again yeah the bounce was lucky okay get corner oh here comes another one and fake sailing fake sailing people even here they read the fake ceiling it's so annoying to play these players on ones man because they just get a flip they they threaten it the whole time and they do that make it boost and then try to bring it to the ground just gonna go what the heck dude the delay so annoying yeah uh just shoot it as soon as you can and you take his corner views uh maybe not maybe not i don't think you'd save like that um mid left boost nice and just do something kind of safe like don't go all in as i go all in pretty much yeah as long as you get a good recovery you're fine i wanna ah you might shoot play normal avoid demo 50 if you can it's nice he's going to get back watch pump oh you have the speed i see like they're 100 i would get demoed 100 your car is literally faster than mine is that a triple slippery set on me again okay and hit it back in the back okay oh i trolled it uh get the other okay dude it's actually so much harder than i thought that's 50 i like how you're just not doing anything okay dude i'm struggling way more in this game it's like a faster face game no it's okay the right boost and like get the ball too and flip reset single flip refit you don't you don't got to be all fancy schmancy with them you know what i mean oh my god oh my god oh my god don't say thanks don't think and say say thanks after you flip on kikka it it's going to make him look at the chat and you're going to win the kickoff no i'm not i'll take my head off the controller no i think no that was smart that was smart i like the thought process i know i would never think to do that that's actually genius all right there's no way he starts from here let's get really close but don't go all right oh wait a second oh that's big it's big he's low doomsday dish if you can nice nice i think we got to be annoying against this guy just keep going yeah don't give him the space oh what was that landing what the heck 50 oh uh fake challenge and then go now nice you wait use your flip user flip oh i didn't get it i tried dang it you can't get a boost either yeah just wait on mid okay nevermind oh that's fine there's not much boost i don't think no he just got a hundred okay i don't know what to do just like just do the annoying ones thing let's go really close and then without over committing nice you should have here let's go quick real quick nice get mid and try demo or something oh i got this boost too no yeah it's like be annoying i don't i don't know what to say like there's no way to like to describe how to play against this dude it's like an annoying ones thing like real quick okay get boost and then uh you don't have a good setup see i would not be able to set that up what to say i have full control here okay okay touch and then flip instantly staying close yeah yeah yeah uh take it a corner boost okay never mind everybody see i would not oh take it back you can't score you can again yeah yeah might be bad nine oh my god yeah it doesn't have anything here uh take it across and then bounce dribble one touch and then shoot yeah get his boots get his boots oh no way clutch oh my god [Music] let's go that was a smart call i wouldn't have done that either i don't know why i wouldn't have done it yeah i would have done that and then i wouldn't i wouldn't have the ice i would no way i would finish that all right we got this gotta finish it off let's go yeah yeah okay if you have the chance to bring out the wall belt just get like bounce dribbles and stuff nice just wait just wait oh wait how do you think to do that i literally would have never thought to do that in my entire life the pre-flip within the touch and the face the early jump with car camera that's so clean i would have just played it and let him panic dude we punched up he triple he triple reset you got overconfident oh my god also it says mine is zero for the video i'm i'm not probably not gonna add it in so i'm just gonna let them know it says mine is zero because i had to forfeit early because the stream died for musty so i forfeited earlier the last game like 10 seconds in so we can restart but yeah i'm gonna let him know that was a good way to end it man that's gonna be off this one guys i hope you enjoyed huge shout out to musty for actually bringing this idea to my attention because i didn't know about it apparently yukio and mercy did this first with yukiya playing in murti trying to coach him in game uh so it must be his idea to try it with me we actually did pretty well not gonna lie we're playing some really good high level players and we won two out of three games pretty solid and the other game were i think one goal away from winning something like that so not bad at all yeah i hope you guys enjoyed it again huge shout out to musty the goat thank you so much for coming along and doing this video with me and i'll probably try to do one of these the other way around where i coach musty and we'll see how that goes so yeah hope you guys enjoyed like i said have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
