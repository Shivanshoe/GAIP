yo what's up guys going to be running some twos with my ex teammate torment from c9 but now he's on v1 this is brand new org so it should be some good games i've have a tour in a while actually but i think it's going to be good we still have that four years of chemistry together so we'll see how it goes all right the first game played against turoku and rodoko it's actually pretty sick combo names this is going to be a a super sweaty one i can already tell maybe one of those games i'm gonna try to kill him if he drills this should be good for tor the placement there we go the top corner banger so we like to see gotta hit those shots when you have the chance gotta take advantage of those situations gotta be careful here should have that wipe it towards dribble off back couldn't double but i gotta get past the torment oh my god i almost saved it that's almost terrible oh my two up though 30 seconds in they can definitely come back is a super solid two's lobby here taroka is one of the best news players in a in my opinion when he's on his game man is super solid really hard to beat there we go good pass from torment there to spot me out for use four years of experience in the bag right there coming through shine oops that was bad didn't go anywhere i got a little scared i won't lie to you should be good for torah nice i've seen him score these 1v1s close pumped one oh if i can get the second bump there have been huge turoko's low boost here tor just got to play it smart on the 50. did a pretty good job i'd say start a good amount of time got the boost which is good taurus should have this i still let him take it i've been full boost anyway if i hit that off back oh my bad my baby four years of experience you know mistakes still happen trying to block them trying to fake get the ball in a good spot for torment here don't get an over aggressive situation like that it's just not worth the risk try to stay on this actually really get a bump from turoka there like that a lot he's faking me here let's go for the shot good boost deal we'll take mid boost and rotate on tour here should be okay for tour the block not bad i'm gonna leave that it's probably better for him i just got mid left as well which is pretty big he's gonna dribble this it's not going to go to any of these days oh i was going to play from turkey i went for two bumps a i said this one for the ball one of them honestly would have been better tour was in a really rough spot again turoku is one of those really smart twos players he always always makes the right choice in the situations and he did there as expected should i get this to the right side before here with tory himmy with the damn that was damn worthy about that for tour nice might be double right behind you nice did i have one more probably bubble oh that have been so huge close almost there dribble we needed there nice it passed from tour there we do still got it though all right pretty solid game all around probably going to play the same players honestly they're really solid and uh very good match up no matter what we might lose the next one but who cares it's always a good matchup it's always good practice so let's get into the next one let's even keep it up let's see if we can get the back-to-back wins for today's video but really good first game very happy with how we played let's get into the next all right we got the exact same team for the last game it is what i wanted though making an intense back-to-back set of games they're gonna play super solid this game i already know you can already tell it's gonna be a sweatier match such an awkward spot to be in because he could flick that super high over me if he doesn't then i have to be ready for the dribble anyway so there's two pretty difficult to cover options that he has in that situation uh should be a goal for me killed the one which is big i'm gonna pop that i don't have any boost so not many other options i have there try to get us on the wall that's fine actually better for tor i feel like much better play delete that for him probably good for him here too nice i like this play a lot actually that's a really good say from ridoko on to some boost here i like that backboard play it's a good idea should have this if i don't miss block two torch should be okay here to go for this oh he's further back than i thought it took a pinch though for us twerk a try close ah it's got to be a goal there's good speed to go for that i just gotta score it everything but the finish was good two of them i got my boost it's actually huge but toward leaving that mid boost is really big for us as well actually try to keep pressure on that and the boost stills they're getting the perfect boost grabs here leaving that corner in hindsight probably should have taken it because he just got boost out of it oh this huge double attempt god damn that's actually insane i was really good speed nice those good defense from them good patience is really impatient you have to play super passive on those balls you could so easily get scored on by it might be a goal i don't know if i can actually reach this ended up being fine but he got my boost kind of sucks i gotta get some some pads here i'm dead hopefully twerking hold it down there i believe oh bart downs he's saved by the the bar huge that was a really bad pass for me i'm not gonna lie should be good though stalled sometime like i said it's always gonna be a sweaty game man it has been sweaty 1-0 and three minutes and twos is actually like barely ever seen that's really a play from turkey i'm just not helping enough there on that first challenge i'm trying to bump him but he just jumps over me every time and then it doesn't help tour enough i could do more in that challenge it's on me gotta help him a little bit better there he loves to wait on this nice bit of the flick out towards going to go again she's not bad good luck for him kind of bad there because i'm stuck in the net now i bumped it would have been pretty huge for us nice and tour just one guy now and i killed the other one which is really big he's gonna kill time for his teammate though just smart good play from him all right we'll take that could have definitely been a better shot i don't even think it was i think i might have been barred down and out but if it goes in you take those but you gotta look at placing that better at the next time for sure even if it went in so they go for at that time i don't want to go for that same bump play hasn't been working too well they're jumping over there every time leave that corner for him about a boost i believe in torah good patience really a patience to kill time for me i believe we can hold on i was so laggy i guess i respect my boom there he's faking that there we go all right two good games back to back hope you guys enjoyed it was super sweaty which is what i wanted i like these intense matchups for you guys to watch have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this like comment subscribe to see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
