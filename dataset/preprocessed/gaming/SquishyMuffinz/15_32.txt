yo what's up guys so i said in the last video that i'll be doing some of my extra modes placements so i'm going to do one video for hoops one video for a drop shot one video for rumble maybe a video for snow day but i don't really like snow day all that much um you guys always seem to like at least one video per season when i do a placement for like all of these extra modes so i'm gonna do one for each for sure i don't know about snow day i don't really like sunday that much let me know down below if you guys want to see snow do you want i don't know if i'll do snow day but hoops for sure i know you guys love drop shot guys love and rumble is always fun so let's get into two games of hoops for today and i'll make a video on the other two game modes for the coming days but yeah let's get into the hoops video all right the first game we got uh silver stone and fatality actually like that name what i like that name so much so cool take a shot here let's go back quick way back wall good shot actually made it really awkward we shot it let's block them closely closed captioning not available can actually go yet that's fine good for our chance should flick this soon he did maybe back wall probably get under him give me a goal nice it's a really good uh first touch today that was everything trying to get under this with the flip play into a spot where we can follow it up with the flip cancel nice little double at the end good try on the block from them as well i'm not sure if i think he goes for it he does the pad i think that's the right way i always forget it's a good stop should take an extra second on that i feel like i rushed it a bit thinking he would go i had more time than it seemed like oh i just traded well done for my teammate i don't know how intentional that was but well then so i have a free edible here a bit of a one try to block this guy not the best recovery i didn't really wave dash but i could follow up myself should be okay for a second go back wall pretty much deal with anything if you have a back wall in this mode i feel like asked my teammate let's play it around this guy it's up someone jumped for it like another touchscreen to myself maybe one more over him should be a ghoul nice i feel like if you have the ability to like pass yourself or like irritable long distances from the back wall in this mode you're already at a massive advantage it's like a really hard thing to do but super satisfying when you actually pull it off wait for the bounce here let's stop that's my teammate actually like the perfect first touch super hard ball to get a good first touch on because i go fastest coming at him good first touch any half flips off of it and gets a double that's well done really good job looked a lot easier than it was for sure we started up four goals first hoop games of the season today good start oh i'm at work still yeah i hit the the rim but i ended up bouncing against me dude stop i went for a musty off it's gonna wait back well let me go for the back corner i feel like this is a big brain it's gonna come here good stuff from him i still have 70 boost i didn't waste much should be able to recover here that's thing is like if all their shots end up being those high floaty like chips like that if you just wipe back while there's really nothing that they can do to have that vehicle it's never going to like outplay the last defender is one of those little chips like that i'm gonna try to get a little more creative in this mode i feel like almost straight in watch my teammate i'm gonna wait a second here oh almost what i wanted but i didn't quite get it i'm gonna grab the other corner here and i hope he doesn't get the perfect flick it's actually really hard like a lot of scenarios where the ball will be is like super hard to get a shot of like you have to have it fall down into the net if you beat somebody get it around someone have it fall down into that's like very hard most of the time should be over nice i wasn't sure how to get that into the net but he pulled it off so it was really awkward super awkward i had to wait for the right chance to get a double there off the room put round one let me go for that boost but two minutes there so it's fine i'll be back here wait for the bounce should be fine jimmy should have this nice actually could read i thought it would be over him are you air dribble i'm going to fake give me a hit i read this oh not what i want i want it to be a goal after that but it's hard try to get to the wall here to control this this put off the wall to myself around one more might be a goal for them maybe we can get brazil though i don't mind that brazil's doable gotta be ready to shoot whatever comes off of this here and i hope it's not straight in no way it's so doable never give up teammate go crazy ah get all right good first game let's get the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs for our first hoop schemes of the season it's actually a lot of fun i like this mode a lot it's really good against the next game all right for the last thing we got wavy against a kunin and free combos baby's got the c9 decal on representing the old squad it up to the side it's a good block only thing is we kind of got a position off of it take our time here make some throw it away better on one more oh i missed the ceiling touch there but i got the perfect touch so i can follow this in that's like light enough it's actually really hard to do that but it's a good attempt so right play too much should go done a good job to control and he's like awkward spots nice should be okay i should beat them all still just camping back wall let him hit it away you should hit this away too probably it's actually a good demo my team has to just save this though it should be fun i ended up missing but should be okay still and the back ball the only way to avoid the the backward situation is try to air dribble slow like this try to play it over them when they come kind of the only way you can make it more difficult on them because any shot you take if they're backboard which is where they should be it's gonna be very hard like see that guy's not back wall for one shot and he makes a big big error there you tell a lot of these hoops players the players that just mainly play this game mode they're gonna be very comfortable on the backboard and then any kind of area that's awkward for them they're not gonna be too comfortable with so i think the main thing you have to do if you're trying to get better hoops you're just trying to get like um ssl title and hoops or whatever try to make sure you're getting good at air dribbles and like just controlling the play if you can air dribble and just try to force like a 50 down it's so much better than just going for a shot so much when they go for a shot in this mode but of course you get to outplay them every time even though they're camping back while blackwall is still gonna be the strongest way to defend what i'm doing but shots never going to go in versus an irritable that can definitely go in timothy should win that the back wall again look at like every situation where the balls came back well for both sides it hasn't really accomplished anything it should be a goal that's unlucky bounced really bad but all good really i wasn't even going to hit the the rim end up doing it last second same situation right we don't have anyone back wall it goes for simple urgeable and it's cool really shouldn't be anything that's that hard to stop but my teammate actually couldn't jump earlier than that because he would have hit his car in the rim so that's just like it goes to show how broken and how busted that is in this mode but not the best uh situation for us there like we didn't really have anyone that could go or we didn't have anyone back well as well which is just not ideal for this mode as i've been saying kind of need someone to be there that's not good and i bumped them as well could be a goal maybe i don't know it's hard though all righty it's a good block jimmy should go gotta help him out here hit around one i'm gonna pop it up one more time try to get a shot they missed a goal if they hit it it's probably not that dangerous at least takes one out of the play and the other guy wasted his boost and got it not not that great touch so i played around him close i'm trying to stay on this my team just keeps getting bumped so i'm trying to help out a little bit annoying the instant challenges aren't really working too well for me there so maybe a weird situation i show you one more uh i could have scored that the better first touch but i try to hit it around where the defender was it's harder myself ah this guy has energy in his clan pay and a c9 decal we have a good situation here a fake good for the bounce pass back maybe it's not good i'll just trap this the real warning i've actually never won we won the hoops i could have scored it so easy to like overthink this mode like every situation is like really easy to overthink i feel like it's a lot simpler than it seems that makes sense all right oh my goodness 60 points and they're nervous it is all right man no problemo you got this brother it's your moment nice that's all you need to do that's the game right there now score it for the boys plus should be fine nice all right good games for today i hope you guys enjoyed to have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you all in the next
