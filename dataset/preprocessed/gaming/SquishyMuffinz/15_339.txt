before we head straight into the video guys you ready know what the situation is we're trying to race to 1 million subscribers we're doing really cam well the last couple of videos have done really well you guys have shown incredible support and you're continuing to do that day in and day out so thank you so much guys if any of you watching this video right now are subscribed please go down below and press that subscribe button press the bell she always notified when I upload a brand new video let's get to 1 million subs before the end of the year thank you guys so much he hasn't been insane enjoy the video Yodas of guys in the last video you finished off at 800 for MMR which i think is in to platinum now we've been playing gold players pretty consistently in the last two games we're up to six out of ten matches played we got four more to go today we'll get two more done so we'll have only two more to go in the next video and then we'll finally have our final rank after placements but right now we're at platinum I'm pretty sure is 800 MMR so let's get into the games hopefully we'll play some class and we can kind of see the skill increase in that rank let's get into it alright so are plenty that's all 600 MMR players now one of them is 671 MMR as well so we'll see some decent players I think you're gonna have a banger here so people are already going to walt like I can already tell the difference it's pretty insane I was a good good shot to start it off nothing crazy just staying grounded but you could right tell people we're going on the wall now that guy is challenging super aggressively it's all they're comfortable with their boost their speed it's might even be low plat already we'll see I'm curious either gold 3 or low ply thing cause it played a gold to last video it was 560 so let's see I was like good TAS nice touch that everyone's already like way better than you can so let's pop this off the back let's see what they do probably gonna be a fair bit of panic but much better dealt with in previous ranks still the blasting on that method works very well doesn't matter what rank you're in it's almost always gonna gonna do some damage if you blast one on that I try not to shoot that shot - well I want to try to shoot at low I'm pretty [ __ ] to see if you can save it that way my teammate can follow it up but that's just testing the waters and not sure what they can and cannot save you but definitely not great from what we were previously playing you can already tell decent challenge I try to kill this guy no skill for the the boosts here maybe go for a second kill you didn't spawn on that side I stay grounded there we go I don't have to jump for some awkward aerial there let it come to me they're gonna be waiting for my touch no matter what my teammate got a good 50 over to me I could jump for that if I'm in high rank I'm gonna jump for that shoot obviously somebody's gonna challenge me right away but these guys they don't have the same kind of Boosh management skill they don't have a boost a lot of the time well I can just let it come straight back down to me and go for a shot I have so much time to do that let my teammate go nice it done team mission yo again that's fine he forced a touch play it around me got over one I'll let him have that my teammate can grab this for free nice shorts it behind your team whatever you can on defense you always want to get behind them getting there their support if they're gonna go for a challenge be ready to have the next touch just kind of do the same on offense as well I'm gonna say middle here for support if you get to get 50 if not I can back off put yourself in a spot where you can kind of deal with the bull I don't wanna jump for this quite yet I'll let him panic I have a wide empty net nice good save I didn't wanna shoot that other shot too hard Placido on target not really blasting and was trying to hit it soft this is see what kind of damage just shooting on target can do like I said nothing special is being done at all they're ready for fatigue so we'll play probably three games for today just because that one in super early but I didn't do anything special whatsoever right 844 MMR now and those were gold three players so yeah well played three and I think the next game it should be against Platts so a 44 MMR and they're all around 6:30 that dude is that 671 so I'm assuming 700 MMR is plat so we're willing to play already which is good so we'll play three games for today then and that means we'll finish our placement and play one game in our final rank like our final place rank in the next video as well say our plague 700m to our players so this should be plat there she'd be plot now this would be interesting to see alright yeah that guy was 671 at gold 3 so you guys should all be plat and they start off by not even hitting the ball and kick off so that's interesting we'll definitely take that I'll take this boost here boost crabs are hugely important as well guys if you could take a bit another team take it it's also very important in ones and threes no matter what more you're playing if you could take the opponent's boost that's a huge thing one that's probably the most important because you can starve that one player up very easily but in twos and threes equally is important for pressure imma let him go first how my team is gonna turn as far as waiting back there I'm just gonna fake that team he should have a free ball now you should have challenged that a little bit earlier and that and that down time between when I force him to do this flick like this someone should already be up for that as soon as soon as he's in the middle of his flip animation someone should we go my bad teammate Lobo you said story she's the nicest teammate ever all I did was shoot on target that's it nothing special guys can't stress it enough if you can just get good at banging shots from the ground from anywhere that was something that I practiced so hard when I started playing his game just being able to bang shots grounded it from anywhere literally took me 300 hours or so and free play just to get good at that and once I learned that I was able to just boost your rank so he said I'll go on the backboard here just get a touch like that I'm not gonna do anything too crazy yet but we're getting better they going for aerials they're going up the wall they're trying so I'll try to go up the wall a little bit to see what he does just play this off the back let's see what it does I could hit a shot but let's see so you went out the wall it's a good try but all I did was play off the back take a simple shot on the left so Platt looks like they try to go for more aerials and stuff like they try to go off the wall more they shredded it they try to make things more difficult than the bronze and Silver's did that they never really tried to go for anything difficult they stayed very very basic this very grounded but you're starting to see more aggressive challenges like that this guy is a reeling as a good touch well done but you can still play patient like that area wasn't dangerous anyway really you just bite patient and wait for your waiver the touch to come through and now I have an easy counter-attack cuz that guy got better didn't buy that as well but you could tell that Platinum to go for for a lot more than the bronzes and silvers are going for and especially the Gold's to the Gold's the goals are already trying to start to Ariel and go up the wall but they weren't actually making contact on those balls but you could see Platinum Jerry already making contact on the balls that the the Gold's weren't able to lift that one area like I did this team I haven't seen that gold do that yet Robin I can't play anymore goals like this guy's trying and he's making contact on both aerials that you went for so that's already huge upgrade I believe it from a teammate play it around one I don't need to try to shoot off that it's better to just get it into open space I get 450 if I can kill him it's good not just hit us off the wall just like this that's it nothing crazy teammate might have a free goal nice good job to be there you can even tell my teammates positioning this is better as well like his read of the game you can tell it's much better than that of the Gold's that I've played with and especially the silver and the bronzes they were never ready to be middle I don't think my team will be directly middle for a pass like how much try to pass this middle here he's far as positioning behind me is he should be closer at midfield so I have an option he's kind of sitting in goal so that's that's kind of bad but when I was on offense and I was about hit the ball off the wall he recognized that and he stayed middle which was a good thing so he should have went for that he was kind of just afk angle that's not too great if I'm rotating behind you you can see it to me it's not going for the ball just try the challenge first I could have also just ball chased him for that it cut in front of him but that's not how you should play that out I was a good shot he shot it low not the best touch for my teammate though to be fair good hit from him teammate you should try to control that ball you don't want to flip give them a free shot like that especially my teammates not in a position to follow up that that bad touch if I am in a position to follow up that touch that he just made and sure it's fine if he messed that up but I'm not gonna be expecting you to mess that up close to the time this across my team and you guys up in space over there okay you left it to the that's it nothing crazy gonna have a touch to the side here so it's wait let them make the mistakes I popped it up let him make the touch backed off I didn't use any [ __ ] that shot either I'm not trying to go super fast to these walls so it's impossible for them to save it I'm trying to make its a verb or something do things that plan a player might be able to do Jamie just with the consistency of a pro what's gonna pop us off the wall again just assume he does probably gonna miss it yeah that's it one other place so easily my teammate was a little bit more ready for the Miss could have been a goal for us I'll wait for his shots not gonna be anything crazy I already know that like this way that's why defense against these lower ranks is actually pretty easy when you play a patient enough they're not gonna get good touch it's like I'll wait right here such as it gonna be crazy I could just wait now I have a one-on-one this guy has to panic team is a free shot and it should be a goal so you could just wait a lot of the times for their for their shots because they don't know they user time wisely to the point where they can get a go out of every will be one situation where as you're playing a pro player you're playing a high grand champ every time they haven't won I want dribble they're gonna score most of its on I'd say good nine out of ten times they're gonna score 101 jewel books they know how to use that time but these these lower ranks don't so you can kind of just wait for them to hit the ball see like this away from hitting me again there you go I just got free possession waiting nice I'm gonna free possession again you might write about me I use this bump to get away with that it's fine and score I faked this I faked this one to you okay I just backed out of the fake it was good for his fake though I don't need to go sugar for those sharks I know he's in panic state he has to wait for me to shoot the ball in that situation and if he doesn't wait and he goes in for the challenge like he did then I'm gonna beat him to that shot regardless so he has to try to block the path so if I go for the fake he's kind of screwed you're gonna end up flying super far away they're playing Platts right it was plot one like I said we got 37 points are there were two 881 and we play one more game cuz the first game only lasted like the first minute yes and the next one see we can keep it up legally go alright placement game nine out of ten oh okay okay this is a good lobby it's a good lobby 8:24 on our team against 836 and 850 okay we're the highest MMR in here so though teammate already looking really good nice shot nicely done nice nice nice yeah you can tell look at this powerful touch there alright this dude might be a smurf this guy actually might be a smurf now that now that I look at his a profile picture being a question mark and the fact that he's gonna kick off that high ranks - this guy's probably like a chant player I think he's like a chant player you might be a smurf I could be wrong completely but I play csgo quite a bit and a lot of the times when you play question mark player usually playing a cheater or smurf so it's never uh never a good sign if you're if you're low rank playing a question mark profile especially in platinum because it doesn't take you long at all to get the platinum as you see it took me literally eight games this guy's a reeling much better than five players so we almost definitely won this game I'm I try to do absolutely nothing just just to see like if this guy's smirking for sure but I think he is like I said for sure my profiles never a good sign but then again platinum players could just be much better and then before I don't know but the other team doesn't seem as good as this dude on my team this guy's messing up pretty easy stuff my teammate seems I have pretty good control of his car dude he does here yeah he knows just how to slow down and stuff for fifties jumping off the wall I'm gonna fake this you don't have empty net oh my gosh yeah I think this guy's a little bit notice the other dude how long until it's you forfeit I don't know like this game's probably gonna be short as well might have to do one more might just finish off our placement games I play this middle he's gone for demo I think my teammates like almost definitely a smooth kind of takes away from this game I got lucky in that sense that my teammates probably than these dudes but I really see what these dudes are capable of yet trying to go off the wall I wouldn't know how to aerial for that point yet I don't think right I don't know I mean I could aerial for probably be a miss though by most plots I think that I'm gonna do it already bad a dribble I'll try this dip is a dribble of all time alright and see what this guy I'm a terrible touch he passes this middle that's a good play that's a good play big zoinks it's trying the shot again you could just wait for a lot of these shots in these lower ranks they're not gonna be crazy crazy crazy fast shots all saleable you don't even need to use boost to save Happy's try to just play me in the defense see if my teammate can do yeah this guy's 100% smurfy 100% smurfy he's probably a low champ either low champ or no Champa you're like hi Batman I'm guessing he's not crazy good he's just like definitely better than flat you can tell all right so that was a really short game as well we've played four games that I think for years how many games me played did then played from from 69 played three games play one more why now let's play one more that was that was a quick one let's finish on replacing her at 922 MMR right now let's get into it let's see if we can keep it up they go they go those are all platinum three players and he was at 850 i Platinum three and we're at 922 I think we're we're into Diamond now so we're already gonna get our first taste of diamond I think maybe Darth potatoes diamond that's about it they're playing in 916 891 and we have 891 and our team so we'll keep an eye on Darth potato he's probably gonna be the best in this Lobby I'm guessing based on MMR but MMR's not always the truest showcase of skill you me the suti can do here nice touch middle I like you didn't want to play too close for that there again just trying to black shops from anywhere anywhere it doesn't even need to be anything too fast but a shot on target from any of the corner angles we're gonna throw off a lot of these lower rings I'm not gonna go for the ball see you my teammate this I'll rotate behind him touch actually plate off the back I see if my taking over this young Stu one of the dude place yes probably does not gonna lie to you I could it went for it pretty easily on the wall but I want to see it mighty making go they didn't want to go for something that looks like ridiculous I still haven't really seen Platts or diamonds go for like too much wall stuff so I kind of don't want to do it too much again but we'll see how does a good touch on the wall I blasted it too hard too high that's the right idea you want to just try to take shots from there to make sure to try to channel d'you want a football again so you're started to see like that corner be more in use already this is low diamond I'll leave out there I'm gonna go for anything crazy gotta sleep it there I'll just turn this tube last one home again there you go so still not comfortable enough with his aerials to be able to like lean back and get a save on line and all that is is just a shot from far that's from midfield it's not that fast really like I had boost this wasn't in a good position he's gonna read the fact that I could shoot that well enough so even up to low diamond just taking shots from anywhere I'm sorry I get it it seems like the way to go take that cut the fish it again really guys okay I want to shoot let them go for that good Ariel nicely mighty rabbit we do one more my teammate nice let him touch that to the side off the back team a might have a free goal here to try again still a lack of consistency with the aerials sometimes I'll hit them sometimes they won't all you got to do is position middle for that bi team is gonna have a 50/50 like that it's either gonna go straight back out toward my net or is gonna go middle and you won the the 15 middle there I don't know what he's trying to say oh he's trying to call a guy I bought oh it's getting it's getting feisty out here he said rotate I mean I don't think the rotation does a problem that's Frankie I feel like lower ranks automatically think rotations are the problem but that guy should have no weight to be fair I mean doc potatoes got a point that did went up for Ariel no reason okay now it's tilted dude why does this happen like this was a winnable game Oh No and then this guy on goals oh no the toxicity did you're so cool can I be you know interesting are you trying or just don't know what that even needs I'm pinching this oh sure I start styling these dudes this game's over man they're they're pissed at each others over I just go for dumb stuff there's nothing to gain from this they're both probably pissed each other you stay at the goal date our game can't even block shots LMFAO you are delusional alright this has gotten feisty because you're [ __ ] chasing [ __ ] Oh God alrighty I think it's about time to hit some just like no like some nutters shot it's some like nutty double this is just add to the confusion of their team I don't think I even remember how to Ariel man I have it Ariel so long you have that right he misses that no way he misses that dude I was trying to read his touch I'm going for something cool did his games over permission to go for something cool comments-section they're tilted other minds all right I wasn't that cool but I just wanted to they say if I just get a bunch of like really weird goals in this game I'll just add to the entertainment but yeah like I was listening earlier this game wasn't over yet by any means and like that guy started going together dude and then it just becomes like just a fighting war back and forth because they both think they're better than the other person but if they want to win they shouldn't be doing any of that like if you want to win don't [ __ ] talk your teammate what are you gonna gain I'll get it yeah we got that game over with finally that dude is obviously very mad but we gained 39 more MMR I think we're well into Diamond let's see we [ __ ] out her placements and we got diamond one we finished diamond one that's pretty solid you enough for that when it was obvious who's beating you was I wrong why is he still talking this dude left chicken so you finished our place is off at diamond one finish off with the toxic classic toxic platinum game pretty pretty solid stuff can't say you know I see the grand champion mechanic single in the Platinum is man I don't I think it's a meme right I've seen people in the comment section be like I'm a grand champ Stuckey and platinum to my teammates up and can't rotate but I mean I didn't see anything near grant back annexing I need apply the players have you played against everyone was very very lacking in mechanics not even not a bit close to the highest level so I'm hoping that to me pretty shirt you mean but yeah I'd say the biggest thing to take away from if you're in bronze silver gold platinum is just to make sure you've learned the base of the game in terms of being able to hit the ball fast be able to hit the ball where you want it to be being able to double jump aerial is a huge thing just like a very very simple double jump aerial so if they take a shot on you you can you can save anything in the goal so as long as you can get back and goal here all you really need is to deal with the double jump double jump in a little squirt of boost that's all you really need if you can learn how to do that it's not too crazy it's a very simple touching X twice and then is boosting forward like very easy to learn about side of that if you're in the earlier ranks of the game like all the ranks I just played against pride is hitting the ball flow like this timing the bounce like as it comes off the ground to get power like that so as it comes off the ground again try to jump and get power and then try to learn how to shoot off of that like don't even do anything too crazy to start you should have be practicing stealing shots because realistically you're not you're not gonna get the the proper touch that you need here you're not going to the mechanics to the game well enough to be able to latch onto the ceiling or you know even have a chance at getting a ceiling shot right away so I would say start you know gradually get better and better but start with your your ground bangers and and go from there really but but don't get ahead of yourself man that's the biggest problem I see in lower ranks I was trying to teach my brother when he was like in flat what he's doing wrong like he asked me to tell him what he's doing wrong and the dudes going for stuff that you really should never even be trying to go for yeah like you don't know how to do these things yet so just stay grounded I told him stay grounded if someone's coming just hit it around them like just just try to play it around them and then go for a shot I mean you don't need to do anything crazy and you can get very high ranked by doing that and then once you have a good understanding of how the base of the game work and you know how to hit like power shots and almost all your touches that's that's gonna help you hugely because in the future when you are learning these new mechanics you're gonna know how to slow down the ball you know they get control of the ball you know how to touch the ball exactly how you want it when you're learning things like air dribbles like timing the bounce not irritable that's gonna help so much because you know how to time bounces on power shots like you're gonna know how to have a time that bounce on the air dribble right away because you've been practicing his power shot so much that that's something that I got good at so quick because I already knew how to do like the bow shot with power shot so turning that into an air dribble is so easy for me to trust me you guys take it one step at a time don't get ahead of yourself and you're gonna get so much better you're so quick to promise see how you finish off at diamond 1 961 mm are pretty good stuff for our placements we're gonna go out diamond 1 2 3 and then a champ one two three and then grand champ to go so we're not so far our grand champ already hope you guys have been enjoying it this series so far I wouldn't get against better and better players in the next few videos to come but yeah 4 games today because of all the early forfeits and stuff at the end they got toxic to his teammate and then it went into a back and forth battle as always as it does in the lower ranks but yeah hope you guys enjoyed it thank you guys for all the support Lily and all my videos you guys have been absolutely insane like I said in the previous few we are on track right now to reaching 1 million subs by at the end of the year we're getting
