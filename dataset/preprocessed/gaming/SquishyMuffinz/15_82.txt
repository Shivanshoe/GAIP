yo what's up guys dude we're playing some twos for today with beast mode from shopify rebellion let's get into let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first thing we got ourselves evo and this and neil so we got a sweaty game off the bat here be high ranked players king both u.s west and usc's because it wasn't playing a game for a while but surprisingly weren't because these guys are both really high up i was trying to go for something like where i hit it off the ceiling not necessarily for a shot again but hit off the ceiling for for be smell to get a touch like that like what he just did right there i messed it up a little bit oh good i shouldn't have challenged it was awkward for me i thought maybe i could beat him if i go but i just guess it went back they're stuck on defensive it's a bad goal to give up because we have the advantage there right here we have the advantage i'd say still and uh you can definitely lose games in twos people are just playing really passive even if you're out pressing them by a lot doesn't really matter all it takes is one mistake one bad challenge he just missed the ball i'm all good tried to block him but we need to make contact should be behind him click the high 50 low as long as i can grab that boost i'm in a good spot here sub the advantage have to find a way to keep this [Music] in a good spot for them they weren't able to i was gonna be small to be able to clean it back up like the defender had to find a way to get that in the corner right but it's hard because he didn't get off the ball even though he's on low boost he stayed on the ball [Music] nice okay i'm sorry i'm really tired if i'm not talking as much as usual i'm trying my best i'm really sleepy right now for some reason [Music] gonna jump over him there we go i could have potentially bumped him but that's kind of an awkward spot to do that and my boost level didn't really allow that i'd say my session beast mode let's go back wall here i'm gonna have many options even if he has a flip it doesn't really matter i can cover that and then if he doesn't do anything which he didn't right there you won't feel like a fake this one has the ground it as well it's fun worse than hit it away which is why i like those touches quite a bit kind of awkward back to it though i had to watch out for that bump so i would take a little bit of an extra second and block from him i'm gonna go for a bump on one before i leave that bump out's pretty huge if bismuth can win this uh very unfortunate so if beast mode doesn't get demo there i ended up bumping that guy into a spot where he could bump which is kind of unfortunate but if beast mode uh got out of that it's a free goal for us pretty much so it's all in play for them they're pretty much screwed if they don't play that perfectly close almost cut it behind him it's a good play to make two because you stay grounded the whole time right so i saw my position even if they get a block on it just gotta wait because he has control still be fun go for the boost here i got bumped off really unfortunately better just pressure this i don't want to [ __ ] make because beast was not back yet but i mean i'm jump right there so that's good enough not gonna have any kind of goal on this both have good spots on defense like for everyone's next challenge and i'll just wait mid in the spot where i can react to anything so this guy's bad i'm ready for it it goes well i'm also ready they're in a really bad spot this is like what i mean so this all comes down to how we challenge because we have the advantage like they have to play reactionary on all of these plays they're trying to find a way out so if we play it right here we should eventually get a goal but there's also that one opportunity they're going to get if you just make one bad challenge so you got to play very carefully we're going to spot where they're constantly playing it into us which is really good until they win that one challenge like that right there then we gotta give get the control back twos is very like flip-flop with that stuff i feel like threes you can hold on to an advantage in possession for a lot longer and you cannot choose i'll just pressure him here again just make him hit it doesn't really matter probably not going to be a goal nice good pass from beast mode there give me a lot of options above them which is really good said to beat them take my time on the follow-up touch give the exact same amount of points right now [Music] 18 seconds left i just have to not troll take a bad challenge like we did at the beginning of the game just killing time here's no boost so he has no way forward challenge to the side safely another challenge should be game well done well done all right since the next game is probably them again they're probably the highest ranked people on right now they're both top 50 as well so let's see if we can get two back to backed ups against pretty good opponents so i guess i've got the same guys as i expected it tries to match the highest elo on with you just over to the right side you got the mid boost but it's fine i just gotta lay back make sure you get in the habit like i've talked about this in previous videos but getting the habit of just holding your boost you get that boost just hold on to it you'll be able to do a lot more with it than if you're driving full speed wasting it all the time take this piece from them one soft touch is fine there and the beast one gets the ball for free hopefully he's back for that yes all right they're not actually challenging so i'm going to take advantage of that after this they're just baiting so you guys don't know where baiting is it's like just driving up to the ball trying to make whoever has possession flick because they'll think that um you know you're actually going so trying to get it over someone that's not actually going so right here i'm just baiting the pop then it's my turn to challenge but he's just doing that over and over again he's not actually challenging so we know that like we can see they're both doing that we could take advantage here they have to go so maybe we could take advantage and go under them if not we still have control still possession and i'll have boost as well let's go quick suppose a really good try actually i don't know how i got such a good scoop on that oh my really good try get this in get the boost which is huge get the other boost as well they're going to be really hungry for boosts here they got to either go for a mid boost or get some pads and they're probably not going to be getting pads anytime all right they got the back boost they're gonna be fine for a little bit here put it around them these ones should have again they're trying the shot it wasn't exactly what you wanted but to try just hitting it around him they can pop this now again his waistline is to the side he can't do anything with that it's fun don't mind that at all should be okay i like that fake and i got a good bump there so you guys have played this well he does a good job at it should be angle nicely done so we took advantage we had to control the whole time right the whole first half of the game whether they had control in their half didn't really have any way out they had like maybe one shot that was actually threatening but you're gonna be able to deal with it most of the time as long as you challenge properly he's gonna bait this again just drive on the wall make him pop it as soon as it makes it touch out i can just go straight back that's going to be the extent of the threat in that play ah that's a good fake so beast mode just has to play ball there he doesn't play ball then i i'm essentially not useful at all and he knows that he said my bad but it's all good but if you play ball just eliminates the whole chance of you know you can get faked right but you can't get faked if you just play the ball and then i'll actually use one the back hole and i can just follow it up and have a pretty easy save right so it is a good play from them to take a little bit slower get that fake on him because he has to try to read the touch but i always think best bets to play ball and the guy behind you will have the follow-up that's where the trust comes in there we go that's really good 3x3 type pass it's a really good shot to be across there that's all in the positioning just a free goal if he's positioned well something that you can also look for in lower ranks i think i think the uh passes are something that's just not looked for enough my opinion again see right there beast one challenge one for the ball i got over him but i was back so that's the perfect example of when a mistake isn't made it's gonna have a double here let him hit this away it's fun might be bad all good i think you went for a bump on uh i'm beastmode as well there hence the bumping spam i missed that boost save take my time on the challenge it doesn't matter take this boost you have to rotate all the way back and then maybe even get a shot here there we go you pass from beast mode and a little small detail there but taking the mid boost made him unable to do anything really i knew zero you have to go all the way back and then if you have to go all the way back to this corner there's no way you can actually save this shot nice good job you're ready for the midpass there good finish all right i don't have a lot of time for today so it's gonna be all but i hope you guys enjoyed today's video we got all this coming up soon so i'm really tired i gotta get some rest and uh i'm i've been grinding a lot lately so i've been getting sleepy super early i'm not gonna lie i've been feeling super super sleepy so much
