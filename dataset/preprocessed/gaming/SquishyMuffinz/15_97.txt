yo what's up guys as you guys know i am currently on the road to rank one in all three playlists so what we're gonna do is cue all three players pretty much for every single video and whatever game mode we get we'll play it's really early in the morning right now so i'm gonna be queueing both u.s west and us east that way we have the best chance to find the game right now but i'm gonna be queuing ones twos and threes uh hopefully we can find a one's game it's been so hard to find a ones game man i've been queuing once every single time i'm killing these other modes and i just can't find a game a quick update on leaderboards right now we're currently in number nine in 3v3 which is really good getting close to number one spot number 47 and 2v2 we're only like 10 points i think off of ssl and the 1v1 i haven't really been able to find a game um we're currently number 62. i only have five placements done in 1v1 i actually haven't been able to find the game at all it's really hard to find a match so maybe gotta cue more in like hot spots or like really popular times during the day like probably late late 8-10 p.m at night something like that might work i'm queuing like really early morning and a lot of the times there's no one going players on so i gotta pick my times on iq ones differently i think in order to find games that way we can actually get points and get up there um but yeah mainly aiming for top five in this series of uh of games that i'm trying to play like that's the whole point is i want to go for top five if i can get number one that's icing on the cake so hopefully we can uh we could do it and threes like i said we're almost there already threes is the one that's always going to be pretty easy to get number one in my opinion out of all of them it's probably the easiest because i think most people play twos uh two is the most grinded for some reason even though i don't really like the mode that much but it's the most grounded for sure um but yeah three's probably second most grounded and then ones but ones is hard because the people that play it played a lot like people that have a lot of points have a lot of points when you get up there so it's gonna be hard but we could do it for sure yeah let's uh get to the end today hopefully we can get some dubs i'm not sure what game we're going to play but it'll be fun regardless let's get into it all right we got a two's game to start it off we got prism against aegis and kinley it's actually really sweaty game okay everyone in here not a bad challenge and i got the bump as well just good q took a while but i'm surprised everyone in here is really good really solid lobby another one the q takes a while if you're high mmr you normally get much lower rank than where you currently are wasn't the case for this lobby though thankfully back there uh something i want to mention real quick a little bit of a second to my teammate something small but makes a really big difference he started rotating back and then last second he like turned toward the ball so i had to wait and that kind of messed up the rotation a little bit so make sure you're decisive about your rotations when you're doing stuff like that because they can't really mess up your teammate and we could've got score right there because of it something you definitely gotta be careful of for sure you must take his time here that's fine it's going for the the big clears right for the pinch gotta respect it it's a good challenge teammates should follow should be okay here this is fine to go for it for me go for his boost as well almost got the shot as well would have been perfect very tough angle to get but creates a lot of pressure on them i think going for something like that good idea there to go for the low shot as well very smart play when they're waiting on the back wall like that they don't have any options right then yeah lower hitting it really wide from where they are or even hitting it right at them it's kind of awkward not gonna lie hitting it right at them when they're on back like that is a very weird thing to deal with for some reason almost perfect really good air dribble though i got bumped up right here by him or else i would have probably been able to score that would have been a really good goal but regardless we got it over we needed to get it over here and our team was there for us so we'll play from him to be ready that's all we really need of him there for his flick i'm gonna go quick here try to beat him you're not touch this now do a challenge i'm trying to go back headed back to my teammates it's actually perfect both of them up he managed to play this mid i think a good pass middle here dude really well that's fine here's for solo play i can get some passwords in the air here starting time trying to keep it in i want to put in this part where like i can get it easy to touch right so playing through the corner is a good idea there any kind of challenge should we find and i'll have football's back which is good even if my teammate misses that shouldn't be too big of a deal for now trying to fake the second touch hit her on this guy let's build the ball really quick here so you can actually follow it up and i get a demo which is really big i'm gonna go back to the mid boost to make him bait this for me i can't really full challenges i gotta hope i can make the save really tough spot to be in unfortunately my teammate's challenge didn't well he just missed the ball to be honest but if he was able to force the flick of course to touch forward it's going to be really easy for us for us but hard for me to do anything there i'm gonna get bumped like that kind of have to hope they mess it up if they're going for that play take my time on the wall here put it over one well and fifty the other one's gonna create a lot of pressure and again i can challenge this make him hit it and that's all i have to do no way you can ever listen to our net teammate just goes it should be fine it's a little bit messy now because i have to ariel for that but should be okay stuff all right faith in my teammate he has some space here probably do something with this it's off to myself try to do any kind of shot that creates pressure right that's not to be anything crazy at all i'm really surprised my teammate free jump that i'm not gonna lie he didn't need to at all i would have been back in time to help him as well he still down the ball so much that i would have been able to help him but if he prejumps that it's just situations kind of messed up in general at that point kind of changes the outcome of everything i don't recommend stuff like that if you're last time like if i'm on defense here and i know i'm last night back i'm not going to preach on the school i don't really gain any kind of advantage by doing that right good job to convert that [Music] though yeah big thing especially in like 2v2 because you don't have the extra player that you do have in three is uh make sure that you if you're last night back choose your challenge really well such a tough thing to to explain and even to learn but make sure you pick your your challenge properly and the risk versus the reward of when you're actually challenging if your last time back like right here this is fine for me to go for and i know i can kill time for my teammate to get back and i can block both of them so it's a win in every way of course both of them to waste all their boost and now we get a goal out of it so that's a good situation to go for it but had that ball been more favorable for them to go for i'm not going to be going for that i'm going to be waiting back for my teammate to get behind me safely and then i'll challenge so you got to try to understand the situation in a way that is the risk of challenging worth the potential reward of what will happen out of it right and if the answer is no then don't go but yeah again to the next game good first one see if we can keep it up we got a good amount of points out of that i'm sure yeah we got a couple six or seven so pretty good one or two more games i think one or two more wins were ssl and twos as well and will be selling all three ready um and right now ssl is only top 30 and twos i think so pretty solid all right let's get into the next game [Music] all right we got a twitter game we got trolley and zen really good players we have aegis on our team from last game see how this goes challenges early don't want to give time such as something like valley is really good there's all those situations i don't want to leave them in those spots right they have a ton of time to do anything with the ball right here i think a teammate should probably go back ball backward will be best bet floating there effectively makes it a 1v1 even if i'm back he's not helping enough in a way that i can actually help him back right you want to try to put your teammate in a spot where they can help you back you're not just trying to to go for no reason right you want to be able to put them in a good spot after the challenge and i couldn't really do much to help out after that go for the bump on me i gotta get quick for this get off my teammates try to help me you notice that i was probably in a really bad spot there so i was good here again same situations last time pretty much you get a back wall like i said you can cover pretty much any option on your back wall like that's why i think that's uh the right move there pick the boost too much you have the ball for free can't really go quite yet away i gotta watch out for double as well tv misses he does you just place it low and fast yeah anytime you're playing anyone especially it happens in high ranks um you know low ranks not gonna happen that much probably but people are insanely good like mechanically you can do solo stuff but um in high ranks you just got to try to challenge them in a way where it's really good for your team even if it gets over it doesn't matter you just want to make sure you're just possessing them and leaving the ball in a bad spot for them look at the demo got killed back i just beat him here and i beat him again should be your goal i'm about to alaska good work good work that was really good be jolly on the first one and the second touch around the other guy i think jolly is considered like one of the up-and-comers as well he's been beating like all the best ongoing players one's obviously a very different game mode than twos and also very different than threes because threes is even more different than twos um but trust me audrel is a very good player for sure round one going for the demo on him get the mid boost now team should go so again don't leave him in a situation for the 1v1 they're challenging early and that's the right move there i like that a lot can't do anything with that to make sure you go it's fun look at the bounce here we'll take the shot really well played you have to convert on that take my time here i'm gonna go to the ceiling oh i was hoping i can get that pinch a perfect pinch hit her one time and just leave now it's gonna make him have to hit it back to my teammate so i like doing those touches should be able to pinch this something that'd be a lot faster but i think he might have thought it was going to be faster as well let me get back now that's the best shot but it should be fine i'm gonna challenge first now teammates gonna be back behind me as long as i just make it go over me should be fine you should have went back again but it's okay it's a little mistake that um i think a lot of people still make not going back well enough no situations it makes your life ten thousand times easier that ball is so broken on defense anyone anyone that you think is an insane defender i guarantee they use back wall a lot and if you watch the game play you'll notice it as well again very tough shot to save right there and we actually got it really easily as a back ball defense good shot my first touch played to the wall around them playing this wall that's a really good job from him take his time there like that he's going for me so again i'm gonna go back paul look how much i can deal with ah such a tough thing to control there let me get behind him you should just go for this now yeah you waited too long unfortunate he goes a little bit earlier i'm gonna be behind him to support right but he kind of was hesitant and then he went at the exact time that the opponent wanted him to go he had no more boost left right so honestly the two options either waited out completely or go away earlier and he did kind of in between but it's still a tough spot to be in because again because they're both very good those individual players right i'm not gonna get faked by that it's gonna go straight away [Music] single jump 50 i can just go behind now you may should go i can't beat him to this but i can fake him at least killed him as well which is huge could be fine now play it high teammates should be back well hopefully i gotta go back all year ah man the challenges are just not good right now that's the problem we don't have a good first challenge right so that's the biggest issue there is first challenge like pretty much is not there when he's challenging that so it leaves me a spot where i have to read pretty much every option i have to read a complete fake so no contact on the ball i have to read uh the pinch that can go really fast or just a flip on the shot so there's so many things that i have to be able to read there all because the fish challenge isn't good or nothing that's all you have to be able to to find the way to challenge those soul plays in like a way where it at least makes the opponent dispossess they don't have any way to move forward with the ball yet big challenge here should be okay unfortunately they're going to be going towards here definitely should have won this in regular time just a couple mistakes couldn't have made just gonna shoot that put it back ball we should go should be good let him touch this got the kill which is big oh my teammate beat him there or then massive i don't like that touch kind of help them out but it's okay obviously wasn't trying to it's been a really bad spot but hopefully we can get out of this both messed it up open that everyone's making mistakes try to pass it across pass back good touch from them install time here i don't want to go for that again you can't get a solo play on that that using koraku especially my teammate here wow i was really surprised my team didn't even try to go for that because it could have definitely been a goal against us hopefully he goes quick here unless you're done kind of stall him here looks like i did enough take their boost to mr gear quick i can't really challenge [ __ ] weight fine force two of them to go for that she's big nice still be able to get back dangerous spot though i'm gonna fit through this could take some jelly there did 50 again all right team it has to play well here on this the next couple seconds i had never a way to help him so good job i like that challenge a lot for my teammate because even though there is a little bit of risk in it there's much more reward in the fact that he's cutting out the play really early if i turn again since the challenge it's gonna come down to one little mistake and i guarantee it's gonna have to do with the challenges i could have been tourable but you probably thought someone was closer and ready to get on that ball sound blame them it should be easy for my teammate for the backball look for his challenges here go for 50 again good job all right that did not need to be as hard as it was the biggest thing that was going wrong with our first man challenges and that's something that's like really easy really really easy to work on just watch back your replays and notice what position you're leaving yourself in before the challenge itself i guarantee if you go back in this replay he was placing himself backwards before he had to challenge these balls he's putting himself in spots that it's like you're pretty much setting yourself up to lose the situation you're setting yourself up to be at a disadvantage before it even happens right so that's something that you can fix pretty easily by watching back your replays and and realizing those little things that you're doing wrong before the the challenge even comes out it's just your your pre-positioning before the challenge even happens is probably not the greatest if you find that your first meant challenge is letting your your second man down a lot of the time yeah both of those guys were so probably got a big chunk of points out of that i want to see what they were on leaderboards to be honest actually curious about that because those guys are both really high up most of the time take a look what did we just play against zen is number four um he probably lost quite a bit of points off that because he's queued up with the number 17 player so where are we at off that number one point one point off of ssl after that now we have to work hard for that though i dropped a thousand points against the number four and uh number 17 player and one of them being what some would say is one of the best one going players right now in drawing been destroying everybody um but yeah definitely could have been a much easier game um it happens though you know sometimes games like that get out of hand when they shouldn't and that's you know part of especially how twos works twos is like very random when it comes to that like you can feel like you have a game in the bag and then something like that happens and it's a much tougher game there needs to be but yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night but every time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
