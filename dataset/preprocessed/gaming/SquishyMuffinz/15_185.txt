yo what's up guys so i told you i'll be doing a eye tracker video probably a couple months ago and i did have mine tracker for a while but i hadn't got around to doing it until now so today is going to be that video so let's get into it i hope that you guys actually enjoy this kind of thing if you do let me know and i can do more videos like this in the future but uh if not it can only be a one-time thing is what it is i think it's just a cool thing to show you guys what pros look for in pro gameplay obviously in free play right now you're probably gonna see me just looking at the ball a lot there's nothing else to look at there's nothing to really think about you're just hitting the ball right uh when it comes to the games you just seem to look at the opponent a lot probably stuff like that so let's get to the game today gonna be playing some threes with uh aj and gimmick should be some good ones let's get into it let's see how it goes all right for the first game we're playing against cha master and shiro all right let's get into it not a terrible start i mean like that when it goes like that you just gotta play it in a safe way try to take my time here you always got to be careful like if you're the cheater on kickoff not to push up too far because the scenario that happens like that where the ball can go over your head then you'll leave one guy back for a long time right you don't really want to do that should i let him get the touch here i'm just trying to bait out something let's find a business awake so i get to turn on this get touched to my teammates hopefully you make sure to have that good kill hit off the wall teammates should have this most likely good job one's gonna be to my left wait for his touch here on the wall aj's touching this i got to be a little bit more patient on that ball nice beat from gimmick with the left side if he wants to pass try to take my time on this couldn't go too quick to it the amount of boost i had didn't allow me to fast serial to that and have like a good chance at saving it so it's okay to take our time there gonna float boost for a bit here wait for his touch then i have one more most likely probably has one now follow that up get the corner boost from one of them the other guy's going for the other boost and one's on the wall with me so this is pretty big if we can get a good challenge here no one's challenging yet so they're gonna keep pressure that was well played from them i'm just gonna play this forward kill time for my teammates it's gonna be hard for one of them to get back to this aj should beat him maybe a double tap here close all right i gotta play a little bit patient here but both my teammates are on their side i'm gonna fake challenge first try to get the ball out couldn't exactly get a good touch there but it's fine still played it well enough to the point where i got my teammates back got them to have boost that's all you can ask for in that situation try to keep this in here play it's a gimmick side you must play mid i'll be here i'm not going to go for that little risky i could keep it from aj nice so aj is a good ones player right so you can always rely on them in those situations where it's a 1v1 for a while because you know that guy's not going to challenge most of the time he knows he's last back he's going to take that patient he's going to take that slowly and aj is going to be pretty hard focused on where he is and if he's challenging or not so for the first two minutes of this game i pretty much just been fake challenging for my team making sure i'm in a position to help them out i haven't had to do anything too crazy but sometimes you don't need to in threes try to get double here good job from them stay at midfield with a full boost here i could turn on the wall it's gonna force them to flick not terrible you can make sure to have this pretty easily play for back boost way back before every time you have a full boost you kind of want to just hold on to it you want to make sure in your position to use it when it's actually useful and not just wasted because you have boost right that's what i'd recommend if you do have a bad habit of getting a full boost and just using it immediately you know that's something you probably want to fix you want to try to work on fixing that muscle memory you get a full boost try to make sure you hold on to it until it's necessary every boost is vital especially in threes there's much less to go around with more players on the field obviously so trying to take it more patient is uh a way of life in threes trying to use your boost smarter touch from gimmick try to turn on this it's a good bump aj is a free touch now give me a bump so you gotta be careful i'm just gonna go back it should be aj's ball rotate behind me good read gimmicks on the wall good follow up again just hold on to my boost don't need to be moving at full speed for no reason all the time right behind you now it's my time to go for the ball beat two to the ball there he's gonna fake challenge make him hit it to my teammate aj should come in now make a play nice give me a can turn on this potentially gonna play patient on this right to the left corner still 84 boost that's really good there we didn't use any boost really and we're in a position where if they do shoot this or something like that toward our net we can deal with it pretty easily one pre-jumped oh my god i did not expect that he pre-jumped the other guys pre-jump on the challenge was well played from them got the bump on the guy that was up as well take our time here like gimmick have that now good play going forward he's gonna have one more i'm just gonna fake this make him flick there we go now it's my time to go for the ball it's gonna go up probably i could follow this up should i get a touch mid maybe a bump here close and go for the mid boost aj should have this pretty easily i'll stay back full boost same situation just trying to hold on to my boost for as long as possible to be as useful as possible for my team only use it when i need to make a challenge or i need to get myself into a better position it's only time i should be using that boost going forward not a bad 50. it was a little bit risky though did leave gimmick back for a little bit longer than i would like to playing to the corner aj should touch this mid it's fine it was a mistake but it's challenging again gimmick with the shot potentially all right not a bad first game at all they can't win it's gonna be dropped in a second i can go for this one more time play it out the back wall maybe one more goal for the road ah good read good read good read it's worth going for why not you know they can't win the game could potentially get another goal so why not just give it a shot right all right good first game let's get into the next one played pretty solid didn't really have that many chances of score i gotta start grinding my threes again honestly i'm really really playing it much but let's get into the next one stephen keep it up and get back to back dubs for today and yeah i hope you guys are enjoying the uh the eye tracker video so far let me know down below if you guys do enjoy it if it's like a little bit distracting if the bubble's too big or too small i tried to mess with it to make it look good i did some test recordings with it i hope it looks okay for you guys let's get into it guys all right for some reason this q took forever and we found the exact same team i don't understand why that happens but hopefully we can get the dump let's see how this goes they kick off the start get cheap from aj nice 50 gimmicks up what else is my boost gonna fake this probably take one more time try to play this mid it's a good pass good try from gimmick not enough sauce on the shot nobody wanted probably good play from us there rico good start hold on to our boost well use it in the right situations good pass from gimmick good job for us to be there go for the shot that was really unlucky the guy in the back wall might have saved it to the corner i think and the guy just falling down accidentally scored it went on the right wall here aj wants to use me take my time i pass over to gimmick now good shot get attempts gonna go back now i have full boost should be aj's ball to go for i'm gonna save all my boots behind him try to go for this now get the boost from him always try to take the opponent's boost if they're trying to steal your boost in the corner just go for it don't even bother going for the ball in situation like that because look what ended up happening if i went for the ball most likely i gave him the 50 that he wants he also gets the boost there it's a win-win for him right so if i just let him touch the ball over to my teammates instead and on top of that i get the boost from him even better it's gonna be hard for a gamer to stop this you miss that's okay so you go for this play it off to the side should be okay not too difficult to save that one i played around him it's a good play to the corner another save to the side i played this forward to aj kind of messed up my touch a bit but i ended up going right to aj anyway stay in a position where it kind of threatens a shot good pass from gimmick try to just keep that in i'm going to go back for the mid boost okay gimmick miss i'll just turn i thought it's good to hold on to some boost that we can turn and just be in a position to help out watch out for the demo there one's waiting middle here so i gotta be worried about that nice from gimmick stay made with 40 boost or so after a few pads so i played around i don't have to go for the shot directly there's no point going for the shot there smarter just hit it around let him touch there's gonna be no shot there's no chance he scores this from the side there it's fine i don't mind that at all it won't be one now i'd be left out of gimmick wants me close almost a goal still i have some extra boost here so i'll just keep it in with it i'll have to go for it again it's gonna be that guy's ball over to my teammate anyway so that's fine pretty much a pass back at that point heading into them on purpose to get a free touch back to your teammate not bad at all i'm gonna fake this same situation bidding it out for my teammate to go first then i get behind him he gets over him then i have it let him touch that same situation can hit it forward to me maybe i played this off the ceiling down middle for aj could play it off to gimmick you're making it for the shot potentially close it's gonna bump from here bump two of them hey david the fake not a bad idea i honestly got fake about it more than the opponents did but not a bad idea full boost back here anyway nice try to go for the read here oh my god i missed i i tried to snipe that honestly top bins it was close go back here back boots probably won't be up that's fine i can get some pads grab the other back boost take time to herself here fake the flip just went for a double tap to myself most likely i like the way by the way for a second if the eye tracker looked weird i'll give my quen as well don't the key trust me to get the hit should be okay no boost here gonna fake that try to go for a back boost probably the place i can have full good block from us waiting behind you a full boost back not a bad position at all i don't know what we won he's pretty good in these situations wait for aj to go for me should be okay played off our back wall good counter attack potentially a goal missed by a little bit a little bit unlucky i'm gonna let him go for this there's no real threat in this as well worst case scenario just bounces down here you can't really double so there's 50m the second guy falling up that makes it dangerous but touch itself isn't really that dangerous not much they can do with it do you make sure you go for me nice okay i honestly didn't think he had it looked really awkward for him because he could read though i should trust it right behind you okay give me go for the pinch it look like pop this up once try to follow it off the back wall just get a shot not a bad idea not a bad attempt at a shot either good kill for us try to get the boost from him it's fun good patience good control good last game oh my god okay that is a flick she's in the guy pre-jumped it aj play mid to gimmick dj again but this is crazy gimmick keep it up aj no we went off the top that's fine all right trying to get a six zero second goal there but didn't work out in our favor all right hope you guys enjoyed was a fun video for sure have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times when you're watching this we're almost
