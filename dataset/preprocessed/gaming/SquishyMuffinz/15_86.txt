yo what's up guys today's video we're going to be playing some 2v2 games with wonder mic he's a super solid player he's been on the combobot safe for a while now he's been on some pretty good teams but very solid mechanical player all around he's also very smart good team player as well he likes to use his teammates which is something you don't see so often from the very mechanical players he's very selfless he's uh not selfish at all he's one of the better passing tbc players that i've played with so it should be some good games uh before we get into the game for today though we have a

games all day today i just haven't really been recording so i'm warmed up we'll see how these uh these games go this sesh get this back right boost chill for a little bit he's gonna have full control of this something like one to mike obviously you guys playing your games you won't have someone like one of my controlling the ball but um you can rely on them pretty much do anything with the ball get out of your half get into safety one of the really important things about having those uh really mechanical players i have good control of the ball and i'd say pretty much every pro can do it now that level of control and actually being able to move the ball forward get it past one or two people maybe even three most people can do it now any kind of fast shot on the lower part of the net should be a goal there really good 50 from one then actually left me in a really good spot there gave me a lot of options right i could even fake that shot and the guy coming in has to make a good read on my touch say or whatever it may be unfortunate i'm gonna put the back right they said need boost so that's pretty much what the high level players do to call when they're going back right um instead of cheating i tried to do it for him but they ended up getting a good read on it look at this should work into a goal there we go i knew what to at least be across from me whether it be behind me or straight across i knew he'd be there for it so as long as i just got a fifth in the last guy the other guy is three more seconds to respawn i just demoed him so i know i had a really good situation there i might have had a flip good bump again all you gotta do is low 50 here should work out really well for us and want to end up falling really close also not a bad outcome if i get this boost is huge pass as well now there's a 1v1 so you can do with it there we go all right i just went quick for it i figured it'd be really awkward right gonna be pinching down in front of his goal pretty fast there wants me to fake this okay so i guess i'm gonna go back right booze to their back right play it around him here i can even go up the wall backwards let me play back to wanda now i'm trying to fake the touch and then see if i can play it back to him keep possession because i really have a play going forward you get something out of this bump on the last guy would have been huge played around them i don't even get a goal there it's mainly just to keep it in let him hit this away play back the one this side you should win this ball nice hopefully no one caught the voice crack all good happens i'm going to instagram here i don't think you'll expect it i like to switch it up sometimes because a lot of times i just fake us first man because i don't like to be risky so i'll randomly throw in a real challenge and most time it'll work it'll pay off nice really good pressure they don't really have any way out of that situation really well done i played with wonder a lot though he's someone who runs the game a lot and he seems to be improving really quick so i i have a good feeling about his future i think he's um i'm very promising player for sure i always enjoy playing with him i think it's really fun i don't really enjoy two's that much but i do enjoy playing with uh with him so it says a lot gonna wait for a shot here if it's awkward louie just play patient you gotta think about it like even in the highest rank right these guys aren't going to shoot perfectly you can't you can't think like they're going to shoot perfectly so you shouldn't be scared you shouldn't pre-jump literally playing yourself on the ground if it's awkward they have to play it perfect let them make the mistake right don't make it easy for them by pre-jumping something like that i'm going to pre-jump here try to cut out this play but that's there just to make it easier on the mic but back there in that situation if i'm last man i have no one behind me to help definitely don't go pre-jumping that just do what i did playground that's gonna give yourself a lot more options can't really get back unfortunately oh good i think one i thought i was passing i could have definitely passed that but i didn't think it was a good one to pass because it looked kind of obvious so i went for like a solo play into a 50. he went as well so just committed both of us oh good though if he played a little bit more patient on that obviously he could have a free ball but we're not in comms we're just kind of guessing what each other wants to do can't expect it to be perfect it's a really good 50 good win should be a goal nicely done it's all on the beat right hitting it around them here it's like a really really smart thing to do and something a lot of people just don't expect they expect you to try to go for the shots right off the bat that's what that guy was blocking had one to just try to shoot that would have been a block for sure for the defender there really well done from monday and a good first game really solid stuff we didn't really make that many mistakes and we won by pretty good margin against really good opponents so let's get into the next game see if we keep it up let go let go let me get this back left we're gonna set that that's what that call means i don't think in lower ranks people do that um but in higher ranks just became a thing lately let him waste his boost here you're not gonna have any kind of goal out of this there's no way i mostly flips right there and that's the end of his play don't mind if he beats me to that i'm not gonna do much unless one of them might can't reach that but it should be fun all right i should have a free 1v1 and this is where like people normally thrive in those spots to create some sort of pressure even if he messes it up honestly a lot of the times they'll think it's gonna be some perfect play like i talked about no one's gonna be perfect every time but a lot of people have that thing in their head where they think if it's a good player it's gonna be a perfect play every time that's not the case but soft i can't really get a hit forward so i don't want to flip and lose my position and lose the ball and out of that we get a goal there we go picking and choosing which things you want to like fully commit on is insanely hard to like master i don't think anyone's mastered it yet but that's one of the skills that if you can do it right it helps you so much especially in twos if you're if you're going to focus on the wrong balls and twos you're gonna get destroyed most of the time something you definitely gotta definitely gotta work on see right there there's a good chance he could beat me to that ball but i have confidence that my position is good uh my spacing is really good from where the ball is at and even though he's close and he's blocking his angle i can dunk him out of it look at the drop from one day again to create that pressure to create that space hopefully i did enough with that challenge it's going to be still hard for me to get out of this i wish i'm luck really well done nice good 50. and he gets the boost win which means we can actually create something here nice 50 again look how much pressure you just created on there they're half then we have to do much for any of those plays kind of just low 50 after low 50 but it was it was more deadly than if you went for something crazy the simple stuff is actually really effective especially in twos wow really close let him hit this away it's fine he's gonna panic again probably good job if he turns on this actually really good for us gonna be a bad touch when it can pass to me oh that's unlucky that would have been our goal for us i'm super unlucky to be honest that touch is always going to be bad right if he turns to hit that like he did i knew his touch was going to be really bad and i would actually gotta go out of that but there's always that that off chance that it just hits into the opponent he couldn't control his car anymore just falling down and hit into him really good shot from one day well done beautiful wants to fix i'll go left mid i thought you would have to touch on that because you read it i'm gonna pass this to one there should be a goal nicely done so much space you created on the right side of the field right work for this bounce get that high i'm just gonna go back for back left here first touch here i'll just cut that and leave it i don't want to like focus on that right and it's fine if i die as well it's actually really good i'll be all the way back in the safe position you can even use me as a pass back if you wanted to that's there's a whole other conversation for that i think pass back in this game are like super underutilized but in general i think we're playing out these situations really well move forward for the pass good bump from him he actually interfered with my shot would have been a goal throw my flip as well so you have to be worried about that i tried to go for the top corner and one that got bumped unfortunate big challenge here ball's grounded so they can't do anything if you can get them to ground the ball like that like if you could fake challenge to the point where the ball is grounded their options are so limited it's gonna be really hard for them to do anything with the ball and you know you could literally just wait and wait and wait there's gonna be no danger really play high here for the bounce good pre-jump it's not gonna be our ball and i can go for a bump as well if i get this bump it's gonna be a goal oh close went for a crazy shot i like the idea though i baited it for me and you went as well which isn't a bad thing as long as i can get to the ball really good it's gonna make him pop this again i don't lose anything there driving into the ball at all but i gained a lot i get the kill i get the touch and we're in a really good spot after it all you go for more bumps make the situation awkward or when the mic so you're just air dribbling the whole map nice good save i'm just gonna make them chase you around yes sir the tilt effect i go for two bumps and they're tilted also a high level strategy throwing a couple bumps getting their heads you'd be surprised how many players at the highest level have weak mental when it comes to getting tilted oh i shouldn't wait for that but it's kind of just like a yolo moment the game's over anyway no no no i was trolling good games though for today it's all the stuff a lot of fun next time i play with one mic again i want to record some more with them because it's always a good game it's always fun i think there's always something to learn as well rts coming up soon so i've been playing uh more twos trying to grind it a little bit more than usual gotta get back into the the swing of things because there's a little bit of a break and i took a break as well along with my team there's a bit of a break during the off season but yeah hope you guys enjoyed today's video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace
