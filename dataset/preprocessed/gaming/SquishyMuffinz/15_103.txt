yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some twos and threes for today with one to mike should be some good games hopefully we get a solid third if we do end up queuing into threes cause i know we're both pretty high up on leaderboards i hope it doesn't give us someone that's like really low mmr to balance out the lobby we'll see how it works hopefully it's not too bad though let's get into it we got a game almost instantly see how it goes all right we got threes right away we got jordan we got a really really good player another pro currently on alpine against spatial davitrox and candy i just block them let's look at block aj ended up joining so actually we'll have a third unfortunate timing for him to join we will have a third for the last game at least that's from wonder jordan should have this really good touchscreen he's gonna have a double as well but i saved my boost we can get back pretty easily here and i say from one down good job the forces touch there i like that play off the window side go for the mid boost here killed one which is good wow what a save actually came out of nowhere to save that that's crazy nice touch wonder was following up on the side there so i didn't want to double click with him i decided to wait instead show back here don't want to go quite yet go after the flick is baited which would be fine grab this corner boost it's actually pretty good situation for us if i can kill one of them couldn't quite but it was actually really good about to go for a demo like that i think i might play from them it's gonna be touch a way to wonder but it should be good for us though nice two of them out of the play to the lining in our corner so if we can beat this last guy get a good shot on him at least something that'll force some pressure out of their next touch it's not gonna be the best touch for them should be to get this nice follow prefer to touch you should be fine it's not gonna be a great shot that's unfortunate that's very unfortunate it wasn't a good shot from them but jordan unfortunately thought he had to get a touch on it so ended up on goaling by just a smidge the smallest little touch first touch here i wait for the bounce off the wall for top corner snipe look for his touch here it's good pass this back to jordan i can't actually get a play on goal there so it's better to keep the ball in our team's hands i'd say it's a good touch to make for that reason i'm gonna pressure this ball out here this is really good should be a shot good try get this mid boost see a block actually really good bounce for them but it might work it's a good bounce for them in my opinion because it just like wasn't something i could follow up because it completely died all its momentum died off that bounce and just rolled out mid the guy could have just flipped it stayed in front of it would be really good for him because he missed made it really good for us obviously so one little mistake there changed the whole advantage in that play wow i just slammed the crossbar that's gonna work though honestly i wasn't expecting him to get demoed so i went quicker than i needed to there i was already like locked in on going that fast for that ball still works out though for one this touch nice i can turn on this on the wall try to block them get them up on one as well there we go it's really good thing to do after you make a play like that going for the bump on the the last guy back for the guy that'd be next up in the play that's huge you're gonna secure your team a lot of goals no matter what rank you're in no matter what game you're playing obviously in ones you can't do it as much at all really because if you get 50 on the ball there's no one else to bump but in twos or threes you make a play in the ball like a 50 like that and you go for a bump on the last guy normally a really good thing to do i'm not gonna go for this no point wouldn't really gain as much ground i don't like challenging something like that same with this should be fine for one though and now we have a pretty good situation to counter here there we go it's a good example of like picking the right time to go for the ball picking the right time to counter knowing what's dangerous and what's not that's a a lot of what you're thinking about during every 3-3 game every moment of a 3-3 game is a lot of just thinking about those things save so you see a lot of on defense like it's kind of just deciding what's worth going for and what's not that's the big thing that's always happening in threes i guess i'd say it's good to go for if i could beat two of them there it's pretty good for us but i try to just cut out every game like how to cut out the bad balls the balls that you shouldn't go for that's how i'm looking to improve on every single game that i'm playing it's a good sight from them should be able to get back to this i follow this up myself lithium that's really good because i keep my 70 boost as well i can fake this don't have to rush to that ball i know the guy that's behind me is going to be waiting for my touch regardless so that's something that i really don't have to overthink or over complicate i don't have to get some crazy touch most time that ball's in my hands regardless um and i think that as long as you play that patiently even though you can't see what's behind you you can kind of assume they're going to respect you maybe at the lower ranks not so much i'm not sure if they have that respect when it comes to that but yeah let's get into the next game though we're gonna have aj for the rest of the games for today's video let's get into it see how it goes all right we got ourselves davitrox jordan and special some good players some sweaty players for sure we'll see how this game will go that challenge from the last guy back should be easy safe for him as long as you bait out a flick like that and twos threes completely fine that's why i like going early it just takes out all the threat from the play in those situations it's fine that's from one though should be fine as well try to follow this place open space in the side i really can't get a crazy good clear out of this that's gonna be the best i can do and my team's probably gonna be able to get a challenge on at the very least good try from them though it was unfortunate that aj didn't get the best touch on the challenge so i kind of just went out middle if the challenge was more like a 50 rather than like um a read on his touch it would have been better obviously but it's hard to do that perfectly of course should be good unlucky all right left side if he wants to use me play it around him right to the wall here trying to play that middle that was a good demo from him so just drive into me there gets rid of all the threat he also doesn't waste his position at all which is smart that's how you want to be challenging you don't want to waste your position if you don't have to right that's the big thing about those challenges it's a really good touch i don't know how he hit it like that to be honest it's crazy that's from wonder oh that's unfortunate nice good dunk there might have had the shot straight up i'm not sure if one though didn't get that touch around him might have been able to shoot straight off that but i don't want to say that for sure because i'm obviously it's a hypothetical i don't know what would have happened if i could play that situation back but either way it's hard for one that's to know so columns make a really big difference when it comes to the threes and people don't really realize that i think as much as they should in pro level threes especially columns make a huge difference a lot of the little mistakes that don't happen don't happen because of good communication that's from wanda good job to take his time on this not just throw it away i'm trying to make him awkward here make him panic just gonna dive into it that's all i have to do really team gets the ball for free off of it really unfortunate there that was actually a really smart play from one dip ignores the ball completely goes for the bump there it's gonna be a free goal for me but he gets bumped into the ball unfortunately bump the last guy back as well should be a good situation for us throwing the ball away one that could touch this to me one more time all right i can't really follow that up now so to go back play it high take the mid boost it's fine can't follow that up just wait behind click the high touch try to stay close to it should be good for my teammate that's behind to follow it up i thought i always try to do as well i wish i looked for new ways to to approach the ball or like get a challenge on the ball that's going to be good for my team to follow up next right that's something that i'm always trying to look for when playing threes because i think um the idea of winning a 50 50 forward like i just did right there it's not as good as it would seem most of the time because the ball just goes straight back to the other team right so that's why you'll see me a lot of time i'll do something like this where i force the team to hit it back into my player and we get the ball back again right so that's something that i think is a smarter way to challenge where i'm gonna force this guy to to make a play here and i don't i have no reason to actually fully challenge us until i'm going to have an advantage in that challenge so there's no reason for me to challenge until that's the case that's why you'll see me doing a lot of in threes you see how my team out of every situation always gets the ball right that's how you should always look to play every situation in a way that your team's always going to have the advantage after the fact you don't want to try to play the ball forward so much into spots where you know it's going to be easy for the team to get the ball back and it's going to be hard for your team to get the ball you always try to try to play for that possession and that's a harder thing to to do than it actually sounds like a lot of people look at that like i said the idea of losing 50s as a bad thing when in reality if you could control that 50 back into where your team's at that's way better than winning it will ever be it's a very hard thing to [Music] understand when everyone has this stigma of you know you have to win all your 50s you have to win all your 50s that's not necessarily a good thing unless it's gonna lead to a direct goal then it is those are the the few situations where winning your 50s is the right thing to do doesn't happen very often though where you're 15 their last man back that's more on them making that mistake if it comes to that look at 50. i got the bump on him as well that's kind of crazy i don't know if aj is trying to pass through there but it worked out really well you got the touch on it and the bump on it that's perfect really good controlled touches there right there's a lot to the way i think about playing threes i think it's a lot of um the way that i've always practiced and the role that i i like to play for my team is trying to be a good team player i think i think about it in a very like different way than a lot of people do so that's why if you guys are watching me and i'm i'm giving you very specific tips so this is just the way that i i tend to think about the game i view the game right so not everyone will do the game the same way but i think the best way to play is having that possession giving your team the ball as freely as possible without them having to get around someone if you can get them the ball rolling to them or like off of a 50 it goes behind you right to your team that's perfect in my opinion that's how i've always thought it's the best way to play so that's not something that everyone thinks like that it's just something that um i've just learned to to practice that way and i think that playing the balls in those situations is the best way to play that's just how i've always thought good set of games today guys i hope you enjoyed and have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see where we're at real quick on leaderboards we're at seven we still finished at seven so we didn't get enough points to get past the number five spot but not bad not bad hope you guys enjoyed like i said i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all [Music] [Music] peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
