yo what's up guys gonna be playing some twos for today with aqua we've played with him for some videos in the past but he's a super solid up and coming player should be some good games let's get into it see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves a pretty sweaty game we got don and roll dis see how this one goes trying slightly different camera settings i'll give you guys those in a second i think i only changed one setting but it was fake go low as soon as they gave that one second of space in the air there i knew that was the best chance to take my time and go low with the ball i'll cue threes as well we'll probably just get twos i'll cue both i don't mind playing either it's actually a really good bump for us i'm going to leave them in a 1v1 for a little bit good about from aqua i can't actually convert off of that but i should be able to clean this ball up let them challenge that it's fine it's just gonna give my teammate a free ball i don't mind the situation at all only issue is he did get that corner boost so he's gonna have to go again for me here take my time here gonna assume he's not close could try from aqua if he had made contact on the ball definitely would have been a goal so you can try regardless hit this high into this power they can't get an immediate shot or immediate goal out of it and you should have time to spawn back and get a free ball i'm going to leave this i was there in case he wanted to pass but as soon as he didn't pass that was my my cue to get out of there should i hit a weird form you have to flick that it's fine for a second nice i don't know any boost for a little bit here we got some pads a little bit of an awkward passage of play but we come out on top because aqua's just to go he's a really good uh good dunk from him super lucky you know i can't lie and say that that's fully skill but uh to some extent in this skill sometimes the universe needs to help you out a little bit i can panic a little bit here trying to get the bump bottom to be a goal got it as high as you possibly could without missing that's a good play to make there though doing the squishy thing i stayed up all night yeah my schedule's been pretty bad it's actually like been the best been there today i woke up at noon which i know sounds bad to a lot of you guys but that's pretty good for me it was a good fake to delay that shot got the kill as well it's going to open up a wide open net you can see them leaving yeah they did all right so we might have played two more games because that was uh quite fast so we'll get into another and like i said all q2s and threes for the remaining games but good first game for sure all right for the second game we got ourselves dot and colon p all right the tongue face all right so we got a smurf looks like i don't know what they're trying to do here i don't think that's how boosting works anymore but guys 1400 mmr playing with the 1900 mmr player and he's obviously not 1400 mmr i can tell just by the way he's playing he's not that low so it's a new account i don't know who it is but someone on a new account maybe you're trying to boost that account i don't know how it works anymore i know people used to do that i played off the wall maybe double you try now it might be awkward because aqua went kind of just bashed it off the wall so a little bit scary for a bit here but he finds a way the man finds a way he just pulls things out of his butt we'll take it i gotta be careful here let me last back for a second so i gotta wait play a little bit more patient took my time here i'm just going to bang this i think over one see what they do it's going to miss or get a bad touch it's actually not a terrible touch for them because they stay close to the wall and i can't actually challenge i'm just fake challenging for my teammate get the ball for free another fake challenge here i don't want to hard commit on this i can go for this one nice should be my ball here still all right so you have awkward free ball this boost should come back i didn't so i'll take this be fine because at the very worst there he gets a a dunk there he's gonna play a 22 boost here to try to get this middle let me try very awkward ball to get middle the way is bouncing almost did it wait for aquas touches here i'm gonna like this mid boost from this dude so he has to back off to his corner so i don't have to worry about that guy for a bit this is a good challenge for them all right it's gonna be a pretty good situation for us most likely you just hit it forward good at the danger awkward can get a boost too and i can try to challenge again pressure one more time get a pass me it might be a cool hit try they're an awkward spot still it's fine i can go for a bump on the guy that's to control this give aqua another free shot opportunity and there we go on that guy's screen you probably saved it might have turned okay do good yeah it was a good demo to go for because another guy just fell down from a pretty high up ariel so it's all on that guy that was on the ground to make a play there we bumped them took him out of the equation played off the wall again for aqua good try i get passing i want to kill time to get back i'm last man here for a sec so if he can get away from me it's huge he did he knows i was just waiting for him to get back there get boosts should be able to get back to that unless he gets bombed that's very unlucky to be honest they weren't even trying to bump him trying to pass down this little gap down to aqua but it got blocked and then he wasn't even looking and he bumped them so unfortunate would have been fine so we had the boost advantage there all down to that little slightly unlucky bump i got bumped by aqua so it's gonna be very very awkward for us to get out of this situation yeah very unfortunate game so far not gonna lie i was gonna land on the back ball but aqua jumped with me and i ended up bumping into him made it super super awkward for me because i couldn't land on the wall anymore and control the ball so two very unfortunate goals to be honest but it's fine i'd rather get scored on like that than be outplayed because you know you can come back i'm just gonna go for this at a heavy first touch so kind of my green light the challenge good beat from aqua he's gonna leave him in a 1v1 for a while and i'll be middle here i'm gonna fake this there we go i think gold explosion is so good you could fake them in because you know they're gonna try to pass back or hit it around them so nice little swing to the wall there turn around it's gonna make a panic we gotta go out of it really good fake big brain might be a goal for them though here unless aqua challenges really well and he did let him sit on this ball really smart double jump actually put a roll to aqua they won't expect the pass and there we go pass a little bit too fast another little fake there picking the big touch right away they have to respect the fact that i have full control of the ball and he did and then all i have to do there just bang it to awful full speed and give him a free goal pretty much always playing for the team you know how it is good try i'm gonna take the boost here i know he's gonna have a tough time getting this ball downfield now the amount of boosts he has so let's get in the way once he loses control of it take this boost get a bump on him he's gonna pass to me here i'm not gonna go for this though i can go for a bump pressure out a big touch to our side that's fine there's never going to be a go out of that most likely oh if i got a really good flick on that would be crazy actually the delayed flick can't challenge so i can at least make a bad touch happen to the side here we go for a bump here he has zero boost now he should have low at least so i'm pressuring out a much easier ball for my teammate there it's by being annoying if i go lead here though i don't need to over commit for something but i can at least force out a touch again of course at that touch as well it's gonna make our life a lot easier take this boost so they can't take it on their way out and keep pressure and force out another touches by driving up don't gotta do anything too crazy here we have the lead secured matter of not making a a mistake when it comes to our challenges try he was on our butt there made it really difficult get a direct pull out of that i'm last back again here so i'm going to fake challenge try to make them do something just stay in front of the ball and that's going to make them have very limited options on the ball there we go clean stuff good not to dive there his last back potentially lose that 50 middle leave my team in the 1v1 for a very long time better to stay grounded cut down every option and that's the way he played it out so but yeah we're playing at smurf there for sure he was as good if if not better than his teammate the the 1400 mmr there so i'm not sure who it is but either way let's get into the next game so you can keep it up get back to back to back wins because the first game was a little bit quicker than we would have liked let's see how it goes all right for the last last game we got ourselves don and pete i recognize both these players yet again gonna be sweaty finisher here but we'll see what we can do good pass get my time on the shot there we go we have way too many options there i can go for the setup air dribble i can go for the air dribble bump i can go for the shot far post i can go for the shot close post so almost too many things to cover there the guy has to hope i mess up that's all you can do really pass over to aqua side trying to beat him there that's fine not going to be a good touch from them wait for the bounce down good try on the pinch from the shot i'll challenge first year awkward behind me so that's fine i'm gonna be over me now but i'll save all my boost give my teammate a free ball with all i needed to do there i'm not gonna go for this [ __ ] away because he's stuck on their net so if i end up getting beat or 50 on that ball it's going to be a really bad situation for us ah maybe you should have left it i don't know if aqua could have got back in time because a little bit far from the bounce they bounced above the post but i think maybe leaving it would have put a little bit more pressure on them there i went for the really good shot pass to me maybe i'm going to fake this i can't get a a redirect on it so it's got a bumper map that effect so you can't control this ball it's a good pass actually might be a goal good save i know they can't shoot off this so take my time here make him panic a bit all i can really do on the pass i bumped aqua so i'll try to just delay time here i'll go one more time just make him do something yet again it's fun should be okay good touch you ended up getting a really good bounce rest all right he's faking the jump so i know it's just my my cue to pressure that can't really stay on this wall so i hope you can dunk him i'll just try to challenge first here he's gonna be behind me so that's fine can't really shoot that can be very very tough shot to get and even then awkwardness it's going to be slow if he wants to get around it trying to play smart here not give him anything any little mistake player over one well so 60 boost to work with as well go for a bump or something here try to rotate it i don't want to stay too long grabbing their boost because it's not really useful in that situation rotating how quick is better like the boost here though this is a better spot to take their boost because they're going to need it good high block on that might be a cool that was a good uh series of choices there we didn't take their corner boost in a spot where we know we should rotate it back quick and then in a spot where it was okay and we are definitely the first man we took their corner boost and we're able to turn get a play out of it that's well played check out time here we have full control of the situation so play underneath one fine not gonna be a goal quite yet unless he has a crazy shot well done i can get that boost and i'll be close to supporting 30. wait for the 50 here all right now i'm killing time for him to get back so i know it's not in so i can let it drop the wall kill a lot more time here just block goal angle stay in front of the ball still i'm killing so much time the situation just fine spot for me to be and i might even get to go out of this to be honest we do very smart way to play that we blocked the goal that entire way there's no way they could have got a shot of it and gotta go out of it so what place you must there we go good three games i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys may be watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace than before
