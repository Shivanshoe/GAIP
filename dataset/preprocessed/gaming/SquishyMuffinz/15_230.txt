far and i hope you guys enjoyed today's video love y'all yeah what's up guys gonna be solo queuing some late night two let's get into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game got ourselves typical against rebels and j pal this is super sweaty probably going to be a lot of bumps and just annoying plays in general but that's expected in twos these days all right as typical gets launched to the moon yeah what chooses now is pretty much just staying on the ground as long as possible dribbling as long as possible like this trying to stay with the ball so i'm just not going to jump either i'm just going to be as annoying do the same thing pretty much how it's played these days try to just control the ball as much as you can just make the situation for your teammate as easy as possible it's way more grounded it's almost like in a way it's devolving it's not aerial based being aerial based doesn't matter anymore like you don't have to have really good aerial mechanics because all you need is to be able to dribble really and stay on the ground that's why i like once players in this current meta are actually at an advantage i'd say because they don't really do anything too crazy in the air but on the ground their mechanics are really good see i'm just gonna control every ball this game i buy one buy two on that almost a third nice control from sip good shot there we go almost what we needed but then again but like i was saying that entire play came from just controlling the ball slowing down instead of you know just booming every single time you have a chance to trying to use your brain more rather than just you know hope rather than just hit the ball and hope they miss try to create your opportunities with controlled touches try to stay on this for 50. anything works really that's actually better because it goes to my teammate should be over there we go really good first touch and i caught up in a really awkward position off of that it's a good pop probably wasn't expecting me to go for a a little hit like that and then a big one i think that was the right play to make there i'll go for their boost i'll leave sit back a little bit longer than i should have probably but i think he'll deal with the fun he's very smart very solid player nice it's a good 50. rattle's just grabbing our pads we're smart from him because if we do need that boost it's not going to be there when we most need it we play from sip made it look easy i feel like they might forfeit if this keeps up but they could definitely come back to get one quickly bring it back baiting them all the way in now see if there's a free ball a lot of space i'm just gonna wait back here oh almost the play almost what we wanted i'll just stay on this that's fine it's gonna have set the ball no matter what that's all we want there if i can go for the demo here be good at least just scare them i think it's over but the block we're chilling i went a little bit too far out for that demo it's all good though to stay on this you're trying the 50 i bump the other guy try to just bump him again plus i'm gonna play it back wait for the bounce here [Music] let's just go wrap around for the demo smart play to make for sure but he always goes for it every single time instead of going for the ball in those situations nice and tip to follow good control close on the bump good idea play it off to the wall oh it's not gonna be back he ended up missing he missed as well and he missed as well wow what the heck did i just watch that was three misses in a row on the exact same part of the net all those could have been goals i don't know what i just watched but all right and we got 1850 off of that so we get the next avatar board of the second to last avatar border super clean let's get into the last game of the videos let's get into it see if we can win again let's see how it goes for the last game we got typical again it's leaks and totally not ricky i think that's how you say it we grab this mid-right boost try to just challenge him i probably shouldn't have been so quick to that that's okay i can get that boost now try to be annoying should be enough nice from sip good try i'll try to shoot this there we go i started booster i just landed with a lot and tip got a really good donkey he always manages to get touches that he could fall off himself i think that's what makes him so hard to play against he always gets a little touches perfectly so you can follow it up again every single time he's lost back for a bit here but should be okay unless it's straight in in which case it's pretty unlucky [Music] trying to bump them sips should have a free ball they're both right next to each other if zip wins this be perfect nice hit play right behind here full boost should be a goal good try on the bump good attempt thought maybe you'd shoot but it was smarter to go for the the bump play if you didn't have a good shot nice touch let me go alone probably eagle it's really tough to stop let's try it's gonna fake try to hit this back kill time for sip to get back oh yeah pretty well played there close i try in the shot i'm just gonna go back get the pads in the middle so i can get about 70 by the time i get back try to help them out here you're just coming time for me which is really smart all i needed to do there and it should potentially be a shooting opportunity to try i'm just going to fake this go up the wall now see what he does brings out the sip for free i'm going to fake this i want to hit this away to my teammate i can go right wall try to shoot quick there we go it passed from sip good job to see me up there cheat on this gotta go back quick because kickoff was a little bit a little bit hard to cheat on i'm gonna wait here okay i'll push at least bait it killed one sip should have free nice get the back left boost doing pretty good though they haven't really had any chances they've had two shots i don't even remember what they were so we gotta just wait on this zip's not back yet so i'm trying to just kill as much time as possible for him it's around me but slip's gonna be there like i said trying to actively think about where your teammate is so you can kill time for them is one of the biggest things in twos because you want to try to get yourself out of those two ones by waiting you don't want to just dive and waste the only chance you have it saving it right the best bet is just to wait as long as you possibly can in those situations because you don't want to get bumped i'm going to take my time here just gonna launch that he pre-jumped me he's feeling confident control nice from sit probably a flip reset attempt yeah at the wait because he's probably landing on that again every single time sip can turn try to fall out of myself one more ah almost the the god shot close he's going to have that he's going to boom it i'm going to go back there's probably the boost for me nice control this off the wall over one almost over the second as well i was gonna try i'm gonna go back now yeah playing the way we were playing right now there's pretty much nothing they can do as long as we kill time for each other right here i'm not gonna panic early i'm going to kill time hit out the back wall sips back now even if it's a slow sip has this nothing to worry about i'm covering the uh the opposite of what he's covering every single time and yeah they're pretty low on on options and things they can even try to do in those situations that was a really nice double flip reset pass there got the second flip out of it and got it off back wall to finish it off super well sorry guys i'm pretty tight on time right now or else i would play another game but for today it's going to be all i'm sorry there are two quick forfeits but there are two really good games to watch back and review for the little things like boost management decision making stuff like that really good things to watch back regardless because we did have typical and one of the smartest players in the game so very good stuff to watch back for you guys i love you guys but you know that already i said every single video so have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love you [Music] [Music] you
