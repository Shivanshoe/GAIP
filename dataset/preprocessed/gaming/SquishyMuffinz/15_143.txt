yo what's up guys it's gonna be playing some two today with aqua we're actually really high up on the two's leaderboard so it's definitely gonna be some sweaty games we're at 2251 right now see where that leaves us for the 21 spot right now on the leaderboards so actually yeah really high up and threes i think we're high as well number five right now on three so definitely high in both so it's gonna be hard to find a game probably but uh hopefully it's gonna be a sweaty one and hopefully we can take the dubs today so let's get into it let's see how it goes all right we finally found a game for the first game we got ourselves austin and indigo yeah this goes here awkward ping was looking bad for a second but went back down to the usual should be okay he's already on the back wall situation where i can't square up this but i can just stay in front of it i honestly didn't want to pinch that away i was trying to fake the pinch but it might work i'll call the flip here weight off this feed into that it's pretty big it's gonna make a lot of pressure on the last guy back there got a 50 on two which is good aqua should have this most likely nice it's gonna wait back here you can't shoot off that should be fine let's take a shot see what happens there we go that's why you just tossed a bit of shot sometimes sometimes all you need is a shot on goal and it's enough to create a lot of awkwardness for the opponent and even if that doesn't go in it's still a a weird save to the corner and we're gonna get the possession out of it most likely i'm not sure what happened there it's all good though happens pick off didn't go our way it's a much better kickoff for us i thought it was 50 i'm here but again maybe i touch at the end that bounced over them should be a good spot for us to be in here take our time on this touch take a shot again see what happens enough to force out a weird situation for them i'm playing back i messed up but touch backward to our side isn't bad oh good it seems like austin yeah awesome dc there i think honestly aqua might have just stopped playing all together and the other guy just took the empty net not sure didn't like he was trying to save it though all good though that's before that was completely my fault i could have done better happens though doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter how long you played you mistreat stuff sometimes what makes you human after all cross i couldn't shoot off of it but i can beat him the past is a little too obvious so i know it'd be red if he had passed like right off the bat like as soon as he had a chance to might have worked but when you pop it up like that and then you're boosting all the way in one straight line most of the time it's readable most of the time it gets red at least and touch that would be fine i could put it on the wall here save my 25 boost because i can still do something with this maybe if not i could just play it back i was hoping awkward wouldn't go that was right next to the ball still but it's all good not too big of a deal try to double this good try good attempt at a very very tough angle should be easy for him here not bad should leave this for me play number one can't follow the next but it's very easy for him again still winning the ball here messi's situations let off the back wall play back down mid close good try there no boost here but i still put in an awkward spot for them they have to panic and hit it across let's say we still have the advantages situations because they have to keep playing the ball into us they don't have a past middle every time kind of moving up as solo units rather than together they're moving up as individuals it's always going to be harder for them to actually get something going out of it if they do that unlucky passage is barely getting cut out try to take my time here play it around them there we go and i saw him jump that was my cue stay really close to the ball i full control at that point i think i just played around him keep on speeding up the ball into the opposite direction of where he's jumping from and it's going to be pretty easy for us to go there kind of a weird game so far but these games happen try to rotate behind you you can use me on the left if you wants gotta be careful of that being too obvious again common theme pop it up for my teammate it should be there hopefully it's not in it's not play to myself because awkward stuff pushed up really far so i didn't want to lose that 50 hard or then just bang it away must be in a bad spot easy block for us should be awkward ball nice there's a lot of time in a 1v1 so see what he does with it all right well that's the the upside of having good mechanics being able to do stuff like that when you have a 1v1 i'll play it shot i got bomb man that happened to me all the time when i do that i was gonna be a goal too those bumps they're unlucky but that's all the person going for the challenge can really help for in a situation like that bumps pretty much the best case scenario gets over your head and you bump the person your teammate gets the ball and they can't follow it up so pretty much best case scenario there aqua should have he's not close surprisingly so let's back off into a safer spot should be the game yeah flippy said there makes it almost impossible for them to actually be able to do anything off of that so i played two points two points for that hard bought game hard-fought win there yeah let's get the next one let's see if we can keep it up hopefully get back to back dubs here's our weird first game hopefully the next one's a little bit cleaner let's see how it goes all right we got ourselves too fast and sean here that sun goes bad start as i wasn't really looking at my screen so the kickoff kind of got up from the start but that's okay gonna be a sweaty game though for sure we'll see how it goes got it back yes sir focusing on the kickoff this time gonna pay attention it's on me i was all tabbed that i didn't realize we're in a game so i tap back in and when you tap back in it gets really laggy for a little bit very good win there gonna already make it very awkward on them another free goal so i just waited with full boost in a good position to fall off whatever what happened out of his touchdown i knew it'd be awkward i knew he has to see only the ball from that position so if all he sees is the ball he's gonna panic expecting to be a little bit closer all you gotta do is wait far back gonna be a free goal for me there i always try to imagine like visualize what the opponent's seeing if they have ball cam on and a good rule of thumb is if the ball is high in the air and it's over their head most of the time they're going to panic because all they see is what's above them they don't see anyone that's on the ground next to them to play threaten my flip the whole time there after getting the flip reset and drop down to the ground we gotta get shot at the end there as well aqua should be okay here keyword should never know they hit a perfect shot i just go straight in definitely possibility good stall touch to the corner and delay anything they really have going forward here aqua should go for me here she's sort of awkward now i think it touched from us best we could have really done that situation should be okay for a second he's going for a bump on me that's fine should be okay again big keyword because never know and that's the that's the unknown variable right there because i can't see what's happening with the 1v1 aqua made a little mistake yeah it didn't challenge very well but it's okay but the fake challenge make him do something and he did nothing so kind of just put himself out of position and didn't win the ball out of it so that's the downside of those fake challenges in those situations rotate behind him here good position he should go for me all good keep on waiting for him to challenge for me but that was coming in just a second too late you should just go for me and i'll be back there effectively if he doesn't go for that ball it just makes it a 1v1 because i'm useless in that scenario only way i really got a situation is if he challenges his first man and then it gets over his head and i got the free ball it'd be it would happen a lot earlier than it did it'd be a lot easier to save so i always try to look for like where your team's at try to challenge for them so that they're in a better position it definitely happened a lot especially when there's no comms like no communication going on a lot tougher you have to guess a lot of the time and just assume what your teammates doing i don't blame them for that but in general that's the best way to play those situations out is to try to challenge that your teammate has an easier ball after the fact even if it looks like it might not be the right thing to do that's the best way to play it out yeah we've been in a really really bad situation every single time we've gotten score here we've been in really bad spots we're kind of forced to our absolute limit a lot of these situations it's fun actually not a bad outcome for us he's gonna challenge it away gonna go as well right away he'll be back unlucky dude this game i can't tell if we all suck if we're all good because there's been nine goals in two minutes that should just should not be happening ah big challenges are scary man looking scary nice because i won't be one now you can't do anything with it now unfortunately i don't know what's happening to be honest play was interesting try to maybe get something weird there wasn't a bad idea let's get a bump from them he should go for me here still half the game i'm only down one goal so this is very doable the goals have been very weird to be honest have mainly been just mistakes boarding out plays and that's not going to be anything dangerous better bump this guy awkward yeah i can't get back oh good i'll get all good it is 4am right now guys 5am actually so his games are rough for a reason don't worry awkward only plays like insanely smart on defense and stuff and these guys as well normally don't make these weird mistakes so i don't know what's happening to be honest this is weird this is very weird game but i'm ready to get out of this lobby for sure i can't wait for this one to be over very interesting game man i don't know what's happening to be honest this is the weirdest i'm going to have a 20 goal game man 20 goal game my bed's gonna feel real good after this one that's for sure all right let's get the dub there few minutes left six six no more dumb mistakes if we got this wait for the bounce down here hopefully awkward doesn't commit for this let some panic all right i'm just gonna chill back again because i'm confused i'm gonna try to play the rest of this game a little bit safer because i don't know what is happening i was waiting for awkward to maybe take from me i should have just i should have just fit through myself i heard him i heard him underneath here behind me he was coming and he just didn't go so unlucky unlucky very very weird game man this is up there with the weirdest i've ever played i need help i need help i need help i need help no way i'm so confused why does this feel so weird i'm gonna try to get him to fake we can get something out of this hit it high back wall it's awkward for him aqua should go all right he's not going it's okay we can get something out of this potentially thank you should be fine we have a minute we gotta get some quick goals but they're not making as many mistakes as uh we're making so i know it's gonna be tough let's see what we can do though a left mid here i'm gonna fake this one go onto the ground good try in the 50s a shot all right we got 29 seconds it's not impossible dude both sides are honestly both sides are playing bad here both teams i would say this is more playing bad than playing kid you in a situation shot here good try gotta turn on this it's gonna try to pick toward the wall aqua should go we gotta just be egg right here ah that is just as unlucky as it gets that there is nothing more unlucky than that right there that's how you know that nothing that game would go your way absolutely nothing but yeah good games weirdest game i've ever played by far not close there's not a single game i think in my 13 000 hours that was the worst the single worst bit of gameplay you will ever see from both sides and i want to keep it in and i want you guys to see that just so you can see just so you can see that you know you might be in flat you might be in gold you might be in whatever you're in right but even in ssl and even in 2200 mmr ssl the other team wasn't 2200 mmr they were lower but that was an ssl lobby and high ssl lobby and that might have been some of the worst dumb stuff gamepl very interesting game around but it'll be entertaining for you guys to watch at least so i'm gonna keep it in there why not and that was gonna be the game for today it's 5 00 am i kind of don't want to play another one and it's gonna take another 30 minutes to find another game so hope you guys enjoyed have you have a wonderful day or night whatever times you guys are watching this like comment subscribe i'll see you guys all in the next one which hopefully is better than this one in terms of the gameplay i'm gonna knock you at 5am though because maybe that's the problem maybe everyone's just tired and the gameplay is just bad because everyone's tired it's 5am but yeah hope you enjoyed see us all in the next one i love you peace you
