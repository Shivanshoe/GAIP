yo what's up guys so i was messing with camera settings and i came across these bad boys i was messing with a bunch of stuff and i was trying some low stiffness settings some closer distance i decided to lower the stiffness really far and lower the distance quite a bit so it feels like further distance because when you go fast it brings your camera out of it so it still feels like 270 distance but you have a little bit more wiggle room and you feel a little bit more loose when you play with these so i'm going to try some 1v1 games for today i gotta do my 1v1 placement still so i'm gonna try some other one games and i'm gonna test out these settings and see how good they really are so let's put these to the test in some other one games let's see how it goes all right for first game we got ourselves against bebop v4 let's see how this goes using a merc and he hit me with the single jump kickoff off the bat so this guy's gonna be absolute legend at once you could tell nothing i could do against that kickoff when you're using the merc and you have that beautiful intimidating high hit box what can you do merco fee what could you possibly do you just single jumps on the kickoff and he wins it every time kind of crazy maybe he found the the hack it's like this should i get a flip there we go it's my way to play that out pop it up for the air dribble fake the next touch get a flippy set off it instead and then get a good flip reset there's your soapy it's fine because you got the kickoff on the merc and he's got the boost so probably gonna be tough for me to get out of situation actually i can go for a boost here i notice he left so take a shot see he does good double save there i don't know if i can actually get back to this i get to get enough shot should have it it's a good flick let's save it again guys just an absolute legend saving everything another high touch here very patient from him i like that i like that patience on that because he knows i'm not going to jump forward you know it's too risky good thing about these settings though when you're making those cuts those drift cuts they feel super easy feels super easy to do for some reason one thing i really like about these all right we didn't get the shot on the kickoff fit off the bat but he just showed us on the 50 after the challenge room again play through the corner here nice and soft the good thing about that touch is we save our boost so we can go back and get this one now it becomes a little bit awkward here he still has full control so i got a better map to do something we did we got demo unfortunately he's really suiting the car to be honest he's playing just like how you'd expect someone who plays merc to play very expected with the bumps and stuff very aggressive play style all right he messed up his wave dash still couldn't convert that unfortunately but that single drop kick off he's doing is really good really really good i might have to practice that i don't know how to do it properly to be honest never really practice that myself i can throw the ball away a lot he's throwing the ball away a lot on uh my fake challenges but then it just goes for bumps which makes it really annoying i'm not gonna shoot straight off of this gotta get above it just take a fast shot see he does i'm trying to ensure that i don't miss by doing that being above that ball a little bit more no he's not gonna be able to shoot off that touch that's fine okay i should have empty night here well played found a little bit of an opening these are all sweaty games by the way it's already super sonic legend we're unranked but we're already placed in supersonic legend if you have like back and spot on the cmmr we're already playing super sonic legend and what we wanted players so none of these games are easy by any means i had a friend out there so i just took my time took the shot didn't want to flip early and end up missing or something like a time is the smarter play to make but a single jump kill if you see he always gets back to the ball first so he has a huge advantage off every single kickoff just because of that right because biggest mistake he's making is every time i fake challenge he throws it away instantly it makes my life a little bit easier in those situations get this back boost here situation is almost impossible if i don't early challenge there this race becomes very very difficult because you can go for a bump on me you can also fake all right so i have to be worried about all those options big issue there is i didn't early challenge it's actually flipping that kick off i wonder why you decided to flip on that one out of all the other ones i'm gonna go for his boost here in the early challenge okay it's very aggressive play as you'd expect when i have time here i'm gonna try to go for some more aerial stuff because i don't think he's very confident defending that there's someone who plays a lot of ones clearly you could tell by the way he plays so you want to try to put them in positions they're probably not comfortable in which is aerial stuff aerial save stuff like that it's a very delayed stuff like that in the air see a lot of that in twos threes doesn't really happen too often in 1v1 definitely happens but not as often as just ground dribbles and normal power shots and stuff like that you see he always wins the boost off of that if you could learn to kick off and get it down that's a huge advantage to have that's literally giving him a massive advantage off every single one of these kickoffs right can't state that enough how important that is i didn't get killed here which is huge over some aerial based again there you go i love getting that fake flip like that such a good flippy set to get because worst case scenario ends up being a 50 right i love doing this because you have that flip to threaten after the fact but also if they challenge you at that point which they kind of have to it ends up going well for you regardless you have to flip to wave dash out and recover as well to get saved play four into an awkward spot he has to kind of clean it up get the boost just stall this i'm trying to save my boost now they're staying fine if i can let's play to make there and i get the boost play to the other corner get the other boost we should have possession for a sec here i missed the boost but it's fine i'm gonna know that i missed it though so i'm gonna flick early i realize he's not going for his boost so i gotta be very careful in a situation but for a straight up shot did not expect that did not expect that but we'll play for him i'll single jump kick off myself actually got the the boost out of it so i ended up working pretty well take our time here there we go hold played pick the high on the air dribble right there get the respect and i just left it over the bump very very very high likeliness that that goes in and he ended up forfeiting even though he had three seconds and definitely a possibility to win that game and potentially tie it up but uh yeah he played a super sign legend as you can see right there already someone is grinding the hell out of one you could tell just by the way he plays very good once player let's get to the next one seem to keep it up get back to back dubs it's gonna be sweaty but let's see if we can do it all right for last thing we got a sweater and we got jordan from alpine so we got another pro player here the probie pro action i've never played him in once i don't even know he played one to be honest probably just doing his placements as well shot early i'm gonna go for this corner here gonna be a little boost here he has to make a play it's kind of awkward the way this is panning out this passage of play here kind of has to turn actually really good shot from him it's a lot of pressure on me very tough for me to get back to that i should challenge right there that was kind of my opportunity that becomes very very difficult as you can see i don't notice as soon as i didn't challenge that that was the the best chance to challenge us i'm screwed i saw the situation ended up handing out people are really good at making sure that when i have those 1v1 potential dribble bump possibilities at the end of scoring them right very unlikely i get back to that and let's say a little bit lucky or he messes up unfortunately none of that happened that's quite unlucky as well there was a little little point where i was trying to get underneath where he would be and where the ball was right trying to get it behind him a little bit it would have been a free goal for me where he was but ended up hitting you into i'm gonna have to do anything and just led to a free goal like to say extremely aggressive looks like which is surprising because when you play him in threes it's kind of the opposite feels like he's more of a passive player he's playing super aggressive trying to go for the ball at all times maybe he's working to not give me space maybe that's his plan it's been working pretty well haven't had many opportunities straight up 1v1 him on dribbles so if that's his plan it's definitely working now i'm just winning all the kickoffs is that what we want goes you guys love watching 1v1s i'm not sure why because i feel like twos and threes have a lot more skill involved when it comes to coordinating with a team and stuff like that but this is the game mode you guys like watching so guys i've always loved watching me play once it's the game when i started playing first on this channel and you guys still love watching it to this day should i get in the way put it in the way again here it's a better get this back boost now and then move down the field gonna pre-jump and just float he's going for a bump on me again all right that seems like his preferred his preferred way of scoring it's pretty much always done when he's had the ball in full control of it so we know what to look out for we just got to stop it before he gets the pop in the air that's a good play very good power shot how many options he has there so the outside about one v ones and diff between ones and threes when dealing with those air dribble bumps and threes you just challenge early there'll be somebody back then clean up a free ball if it's over you right but in one there's no one to challenge early and they know that and if they know that they can just strictly go for the bump right way to the very last moment and you're stuck in a very bad situation didn't quite get the shot on gopro doesn't attempt my challenge early because i haven't really done that yet there we go take advantage of it it's a good play i know he's always a little bit more to the left that's why i'm aiming to the opposite side that's going to make me win it most of the time play up into a way that i can follow it up into a really difficult spot for only getting a touch on this it's actually the best that she could have gotten did almost score i just reacted to really quick ready to touch around them take my time here made a mistake so i didn't want to rush it and get a bad touch i'd rather kill me puts me back into at least a somewhat decent position even though it's gonna be tough to save this still yeah gonna be tough regardless i miss my important touch to be able to convert on the emptiness day in the air but once i landed it was too awkward he was gonna get back in time to be able to get it back though off a kickoff must be a frustrating game for him i've had three of those but in all fairness he's had three dribble bumps are pretty much the same thing the same worth in my book but i get possession here yeah from here i'm just gonna bang this away give myself time to get a boost maybe even a goal to be honest that's the good part about doing that as well is they're forced to make a touch if it's going toward their net right they're forced to make a touch and intercept that at some point so they have to go to the left or right corner and that's going to stall extra time for me to get boost and if it's just dangerous it's in we just have a free goal no downside to scoring a goal right i'll try something here oh he's just going right away nevermind i'm trying to take my time but like i said he's playing very aggressive trying not to give me that time so i'll play for him yeah good play look reset he's not leaving that i respect that i respect it he's about to grind he knows he can come back minute 40 definitely doable for him like i said he is a fellow pro player so he knows what he is capable of in terms of comebacks the settings feels super nice though guys you have to try them feels weird at first for sure if you're not used to the looseness of it but if you're used to using like 270 distance it's actually gonna feel pretty okay i think for most of you guys that played through the corner followed it myself i tried something a little too crazy a little too crazy can't get back now all right we could throw this we could throw this he's definitely good enough of an opponent that you can come back and five goals gotta be careful also i just wanted to mention how funny it is that someone i've never played before in my entire life the guy who played last game gave me much tougher of a challenge than another professional player that's just how rank goes man people you never play against play styles you've never played against you don't understand will always be tougher than even people that are considered some of the best in the world he's afk give him the ball let's see freestyle on me oh yeah that's the interesting thing about ranked for sure you deal with all these different play styles people that like to look at the game in different ways and you know you're playing them for the first time ever it's a good chance it'll catch you off guard and they potentially beat you but the more you get used to it the easier it'll be to play against i bet if i play that's a weird shot i bet if i played um that dude three or four more times it'd be a lot easier to play him and i beat him by more every time but that's just that's just because you can get used to the play style and be able to adapt right kind of expected it's kind of the same way 3x3 and 2v2 goes in this game as well this game is definitely over ended up doubling his goals i don't think he can come back i respect not forfeiting here i do i do he's trying to he's trying to make a little comeback a little sneaky comeback i see it i see it i respect it yeah the aggressor approach is one that most people like to take against me it seems like i play them in ones people don't really give me space anymore i mean i used to a long time ago when i used to be really good at ones and used to like grind it all the time not that i'm bad at them now i just don't grind it like i used to because i don't enjoy it when i used to grind it a lot people would give me a lot of space and all i'm gonna do is about triple power shot bounce triple power shot every time i hit top corner top corner and there's nothing you can really do about it so people kind of figured out that if you challenge that early it kind of takes a lot of the threat away right there's some really good ones players that use that play style that i used to use like ocala is one of them he has that playstyle still the bounce dribbles but he throws in some fakes here and there makes a little bit harder to read and keep it up see we can do here a little passing play going no no all right try my very best to keep it up all i wanted all right hope you guys enjoyed it it's going to be obviously guys try out these camera settings if you haven't ever tried them i doubt you have they're very weird and unique so i'll show you guys one more time so you don't have to go back in the video here they are and let me know what you guys think about the camera settings down below let me know if you like them i might use these for a little bit i'm not sure if i like them in threes or not i haven't tested them i'll probably try them out in some scrims see if i like them there and uh if you guys see me using them in future videos you'll know i like them if uh if not then i'm probably trying new settings and experimenting with other ones i've been playing this game for so long man i try to experiment with stuff keep it fresh keep it new maybe find something i really like maybe find something that i think is insane these settings i felt the closest thing to that insane feeling to me in a little bit so give them a try yourself let me know what you guys think love you guys thank you for all the support on the channel if you're not subscribed to channel please make sure you go down below right now press the subscribe
