sonic legend in 1v1 so i grinded all the way up to the point where we're exactly one game win away from supersonic legend it's 1354 to get it in the 1v1 playlist so like i said one game win will do it so let's get straight into it let's see if we can get super sonic legend and then hopefully we can play one game in supersonic legend and see if we can get two back-to-back dubs for today let's get into it let's see how it goes all right for the first game we're playing against someone named vibes this might be our promotion game there's probably somebody really good though we found this game instantly and we're currently like 50th on a leaderboard so it's got to be someone really good really solid not gonna be easy game whatsoever we gotta try to play smart see what can be done here well those awkward starts to a game but it might come out on top got him stuck in our corner and eventually played it out well very interesting start but that's how 1v1 can go should i get a good kick off here not bad for us to lose that challenge honestly we get the boost and we're back in the same corner and he's not going to play the same way because it got him scored on so that's good adjustment from him good save for some reason my car did not want to stick to the floor there we'll get some pads on our way back here i know it's safe to get the boost temporarily it's gonna be a hard shot to defend yeah not much i can do at that point it's a good shot from him he played it well good bump get a kick off from us try to take the corner boost here from him it's gonna make the situation very awkward for him to deal with good saves we should come back 50 again should i take the mid boost here actually really good 50s from him he doesn't have a boost but he's still winning the 50s somehow i don't know if i can get around this in time that's fine i try to go for the boost here he has to play for that boost now i know that so make sure i just cut this off still have 30 to work with try to control this good 50s it's been one of those awkward ones games where you never really know what's gonna happen to be honest just been a weird game in general we'll see i think we're doing all right though we're winning most of the most of the 50 50 engagements and every time we have to go for the ball we're challenging where we need to you've been getting beat to somebody's plays like there's no there's no real downside to a lot of it because ends up going back on his half so we could just keep pressuring over and over again right but it's definitely been one of those weird games you can definitely tell try to go for the fake kick off here it's good for us to get possession it's the whole point of that kickoff to get possession right away good patience from him away from the challenge there we go as soon as i saw him jump i let him just fall off my car it's going to be a goal every time it's a really good fake hold on your car and you just watch the opponent the whole time i was just laser focused on him as soon as he decided to go i just drop it off my car that was my play the whole time there try to bump them there we go again that's that one play that if you do it right there's nothing your opponent can do the air dribble bump it's a very very tough thing to learn how to master but once you do master it or you just get really good at it at the department you can recreate it pretty often you're getting a lot of free goals off of it try to put this back into the corner for the boost good 50 from him should be okay though i'll try to play for my boost again let's go for another dribble here he's up really early i'm gonna go for the boost seems like the right play to make i'm trying to beat out the ball now i'm making him flick it forward he's going for my boost now it's fine i'm gonna hold on to 50 here this is good for a second try to keep boost control trying to force him into spots where he can't really have any way going forward and that's a good position for us to be in because we're making him waste a lot of his boost here wait for shot there we go should probably wait on this again try to bait out the touch try to keep pressure on it play to the corner wait for his neck to sit here all right i thought he's going for the bump again couldn't really tell i feel like i know who this is i feel like this might be forky i want to check yeah i think it is 4k let me check i think i have matted tell by the way he's moving around oh my game is all tabbed [Music] i should check who this is actually it's not working for some reason but oh no not like this not like tasty my controller has been doing that so much on kickoffs i don't know why i definitely need a new one this one's getting like a year and a half old now my flips are a little bit uh a little bit weird sometimes okay i was gonna play got it back i keep i'm gonna watch back the oh i don't have my controller cam on oh no i was gonna say i'll watch that back to see if i did flip there i don't feel like i did there was a good shot three goal lead minute left gotta keep on trying to play smart here you could definitely still get some quick goals this is such a tough spot to be in to defend there we go good defense i'm gonna take these pads on the way back to his half that way i can get a lot of boost going forward not to lose my positioning so i can keep possession here try to go back i don't want to go for a risky shot there and potentially get scored on right it's much better to go for the fake instead there we go we're forcing him to a lot of spots he has no attack there's really nothing you can do in a lot of these positions to get out potentially a goal good save should have had the double probably but it was a good try good attempt to see the ass flip reset gonna flip reset i feel like this is 4k bro i gotta check though this plays really similar with the stuff he goes for yeah i'm not sure it might be him on our alt or something anyway good first game that should be super sonic legend right there we should have got it off of that 913 got the nice shopping cart wheels let's go we actually got it that's hype that's hype there we go so we've been working toward supersonic legend in 1v1 will be going for it in twos and threes next uh but yeah i was running forward and one's even got it straight off the bat so didn't take too long at all really yeah let's play one more once game for today hopefully we can get the back to back dub and get our first win as a supersonic legend yeah let's get into it alright we're playing against the same dude gonna be another sweaty game but hopefully we can finish the video with the back to back he's pretty solid he's pretty solid in the air that's the main thing we want to watch out for it seems like his ground plays are good too he tries to play a lot of mind games um so that stuff's really hard to read but the thing is he has to try to do it a little bit less i think i think he does a little bit too much in some spots so it gets a little bit readable it's a challenge try to go for his boost here this is where we got to try to starve him a bit there we go that was a good play as soon as we have a chance to attack his corner boost we're gonna go in for that as much as we possibly can because those corner boots are the biggest things you want to dominate in one so you want to go for this as much as you possibly can i'm gonna force him to go for his corner here try to control this good fake should be able to wrap around and get a goal as well so while i have buck him off there that's the beauty of having buck came off in a situation like that i'm staring at him the entire time as soon as he goes for it i drop it off my car a little bit win the 50. maybe pretty cool go for my fakie golf here so i went for the first one and i faked the second that way he has to kind of be ready for me to go for it i think he's a little bit a little bit more careful now on this challenge it doesn't really a challenge for him he's probably gonna have a goal out of this i don't think i can get back that's a good shot good challenge for him he's a little bit more careful on his challenge now you could tell he's not diving in like he was before i got those two fakes on him two games back to back like that so he knows he needs to be a little bit more careful he's gonna take a little bit more time so now that he's taking more time we're gonna have a little bit more of an opportunity to go for some air dribble bumps probably gotta be very careful this air dribbles up pretty tough to stop people do those we just gotta play it out smart we have some space now try to go for the bump here there we go like i said we can abuse the fact that we've conditioned him to not want to go for the ball anymore because he faked him twice when he took a direct challenge so i have some time here on the ball if i hit this over him as soon as he goes there we go very good start but he could definitely come back it's a 1v1 game 331 left it's an eternity and once so we got to try to keep focused keep getting some more goals while we can good job from him to stay on this i actually really like this idea a lot very smart from him good goal as well well done good play to stay on that ball he didn't give me the time and now he's gonna try to change his playstyle a little bit more probably gonna try to play more aggressive it's not gonna give me any more time is what i think he's gonna go for you just turn and challenge it away i'm guessing a lot of these a lot of these balls so we'll try to play around that play for the corner boost i missed it a little bit unfortunate don't want to get too greedy though now hopefully he messes us up he wastes his boost on his play i'm gonna take my time here i don't want to throw that away a lot of time on the ball same situation i'm trying to fake him off the ball over and over again i feel like he was so confused at the fact that i just buffed that at his net i love that that's the cheekiest little goal bro he's a very good player very fast player too and he wasn't able to react to the fact that i just shot that so unexpected in his head something he didn't think i would even try to go for so he wasn't ready for it all right it should be okay to save here we go we have an empty net now it's only downside about going for a play like that is a good good play good mechanics from him to get to that point the only downside is if you're playing someone who's used to playing against people flip set all the time which i am you're going to be playing someone who's more patient on defense so they're not going to dive early on that and they're going to have a free ball and you're going to be stuck in their net so you don't you don't want to be going for stuff like that if you notice that the person you're playing against is very patient that's something you play for if you're playing someone who's challenging early for example he just challenged me earlier there on the back wall i pop it out once and i go for a simple touch around him right that right there is much more useful than a flip reset just because you have so much power over when you go for the ball next right flip reset it's kind of a one and done deal you go for that flip your play is over right but if you pop it up once you have so much time to actually control where your second touch goes right try to get some pads here i'm gonna toss the ball on goal here it's gonna have to dribble i could have done more with that but i don't want to go for a direct shot off the bat there try to just pressure him a little bit if you get to go out of this good for him it's honestly really a tough spot to get a shot out of yeah had everything blocked in both situations but it was a good play for me actually a really good idea turned around there was gonna challenge should come back into my area good fake challenge for him he's kind of forced to to go for the next ball try to keep it close to me here to make him as comfortable as possible again die for that corner boost when you can corner boost is one of the biggest things in one i'm going to go for his other corner boost here because i know he's got to be low at this point so then i'm going to get the ball for free forces the ball out eventually and i have another one of those plays off the wall good 50 and again look at the situation i went for the flippy set instead of the the simple like air dribble shot and uh he almost got a counter texture off the bat because of it good corner boost still from him recovery as well i can just play it back though i don't need to play too dangerous in a spot like that should be a goal there we go again a lot of the time i should use an eye tracker for one of these videos i actually do have an eye tracker let me know if you guys want to see an eye tracker video um a lot of the times i'm staring directly at my opponent in a spot like that because i want to see when he challenges me that's the big thing as soon as he jumps off the wall that's my cue to flip that ball around him i like how he plays the back a lot when he's low boost it's a really good idea but the only issue is if you know that your opponent has boost they can just demo you and get a free go out of it but that's still a really good idea if you have no play going forward bring it back right it's especially a good idea if you had a teammate because they can just play a forward off of your touchback it's a really good idea to pass back in threes probably gonna have that save get a wave dash to get there gotta watch the shot here trying to fake gonna go up get the beast try to go for a shot maybe oh that's a good idea try to get 10 here that's doable he's one more touch to the side take the boost ten let's go that's all we wanted so i got the flip there but i wasn't gonna flip into the wall obviously because that would just get me scored on if i just flipped it into the wall so i just i don't forget about the fake every time a lot of what i try to craft my playstyle around is like throwing in smart fakes that are going to make the opponent just like lose their position for nothing it's a lot of what i try to do especially in ones so i don't blame them for like not being ready for a lot of it but i try to do it at really good times people aren't ready for it right like there there's no reason why i should flip into the wall he got faked by me not flipping that ball into the wall but there's no way i can score that if i'm playing threes maybe it goes off the wall to my teammate but even then it's not worth it so i might as well fake keep possession keep my position and keep the ball in the opponent's half rather than give them a free opportunity to clear right that's my whole idea that's my way of thinking when it comes to that but yeah we got supersonic legendary one two back to back and uh yeah there we are we finished off at 1370 mmr we got a ton of more he's really close to supersonic legend as well i checked on the leaderboard yeah guys i hope you enjoyed it's super dope and finally a supersonic legend it does feel rewarding i'm not gonna lie i haven't seen a a new like logo in a long time obviously there hasn't been a new rank in the game in a long time it's gonna be all for this one guys i hope you enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
