yo what's up guys gonna be using the dingo for today we actually got at the shop uh in the cobalt variation i use it for i think like one game something like that and it felt really nice so let's try in some hoops games for today see if it's uh actually good oh you guys know what i think all right so i ended up queuing both drop shot and hoops so we're queuing both extra mode game modes today we got squirty on our team straight off the bat hit us with the no way x squirty i actually love this game i think it's my favorite game but like extra game but at least obviously i like the real game a lot like their normal game mode but out of all the extra game modes it's the most fun for me i think snow day is my my least favorite i feel like you have to play so grounded i don't really like that waiting for next touch here this modes actually like got a lot of levels dude i feel like the highest level like pro game play in this mode would be insane the way people would eventually end up defending and stuff you see how much like that flippy set does so much there so many levels to it i can fake i can do anything with it really but for this hit here i'm trying not to ball chase too much as well but i do want to get a feel for the car that's why i want to try out the extra game let's go i feel like i have a lot of ball time a lot of time to actually see what i think about the car and so far the hits feel like really good to me the corner of the car feels like insanely accurate on its touches every touch has been really good i think so far ah it's unlucky i'm trying to win the 50 you know where it gets like the max power out of the ball and i can hit that section of tiles there gonna pre-jump off the ceiling here it's probably gonna go up the wall so [Music] i was hoping i can get one touch on that make the touch go to the wall oh i try to just like slam it down it might actually work i need to fake them really hard they didn't think i was capable of missing that's so close if the whole side opened up there it's a good play to hit under him this car almost feels like the dominus to me but it's octane hitbox i know for sure it's octane hitbox but it feels so much like the dominance actually reminds me a lot of what the fennick felt like when i first tried the fennec i don't know if you guys remember that video way back but i said that finnick in that penny video that it would be better than octane i think i stopped using it because i was so used to the octane but fennec became easily the second most popular car so i wasn't too wrong on that again pro play now it's either fennec or octane you don't see dominus really i swear the the fennec is literally just a better dominance to me it's supposed to be octane hitbox but it's literally a better dominus like if the dominance in the octane had a baby that's what this part kind of reminds me of as well it's like a second fennec the vibe i get from it unfortunate double commit you try to dribble that one out i actually haven't scored yet but we have so much damage maybe you can score here nope missed time i flip all good hit the ceiling let me let's go down here soon i think i kind of stuck in a bad spot do you make me keep this in maybe ah unfortunately still got the goal though i thought he'd be a little bit quicker to the challenge but i think he might have expected me to go i don't know this game mode's so hectic with that because you're literally just assuming who's gonna go the whole time and then you know it's just so much panic because there's just a thousand things to defend you're depending on the whole floor the idea of the mode is so cool though to me i gotta save my teammate i think i handed to my teammate it might have been he keeps waiting for the bounce you could tell he's used to like playing the normal mode just waits for the bounce on every clear which is good in the normal mode obviously because you get way more power off bounces but and this you're just gonna get a lot of damage against you it's weird because the turning on this car feels crazy to me feels like so snappy like i haven't changed my sense or anything it just feels so different all right we got 39 seconds and honestly if i said i wasn't worried i'd be lying i think we're gonna get scored on here to get beat 20 seconds we have a huge gaping hole on that side try to save my boost here i don't know how i died it might be a goal all right we're good i like to touch off the wall there i think it's it's really good for our team most of the time it's gonna be hard for them to actually do anything off of it all right we did enough i think we did enough i don't want to speak too soon but i think we did enough nice extra damage too all right since the next game i like the first game with this car i'm not gonna lie i felt nice felt clean i have no complaints that's the next one seem to keep it up get back to backed up see how it goes all right for last game we got ourselves north eastern university they're three queuing drop shot full university squadron it's gonna be tough probably you guys are gonna want it sounds like vibes even with the homies that's cool crazy how big like esports have gotten now i feel like even high schools have teams now apparently it's really cool to see i'm happy for all the kids that are gonna be in high school you gotta experience it it wasn't a thing when i was in in high school a couple years back it's crazy how quick things are are changing in that aspect my teammate to go good job it's a good touch there's huge control here as long as you get the next touch on that ball it's fine one of them is going for pumps on me i love how that's the strat that's what they talked about i guess one of them just chased squishy around and just hope we just win that's the the shot they came up with wait for the flip here a lot of damage bump them back i could do that too i played space station for a whole year straight i know their tricks the shenanigans the bump shenanigans first touch here are we doing well we're doing well now the beginning was looking rough but we're doing good now there we go take my time on the shot really good placement the hard one to time i knew there was a hole around there so i had to slot it probably turning block him off for that as well helps you time the exact part of the car you wanna hit the ball with and i think it makes it easier because this car like i said feels a lot like the dominance i was always really good with those shots on dominus bump there would have been a huge actually don't go for bumps enough on this man i feel like bumps are kind of broken in this mode at least and all modes are they're really important i think but you guys worth of one pile of damage for them not having possession i'd take that that trade all right it's almost bad continue why but ended up okay hit it around one there getting messy as drop shot does but all good like a wig dash on the wall around the whole stadium actually kind of sick sorry i'm having fun oh it's internet all good my fault i should have been paying attention i got carried away i just realized you can do that around the entire stadium oh big touch for my teammate here that's unfortunate nice carbs going crazy i think we should focus that back corner i think you can get a lot out of that back corner the big bump hey the bumps are broken man they don't expect them even his teammate bumped me into that bump we got a lot of damage that run my first touch here get into the ceiling all right sure that my teammates can go huge big wait we're going crazy right now we're going crazy look at us we have a thousand points already off the wall i trusted my team i believe in him yes sir all you gotta do is believe should be fun i believe again oh trying to touch it to myself with the backflip and then just get it into that that hole popping it up if you beat him it's huge i think we got it there we go trying to look for the hole trying to spot it now when you see the comments in this video you guys somehow making dirty jokes out of my innocent comments my innocent commentary i believe in my team we got 30 seconds left they don't even have a hole in the ground yet i think it's going to get really bad in a second though i have a a bad feeling all right we're good huge mess over there but nicely done in the squad big i'm almost slotting everything this game this car is crazy this car feels like insanely accurate with the touches guys i'm not gonna lie to you i didn't realize there was a hole there i was trying to kill the ball by like air drilling into the floor in a way that they couldn't win off of but we could have lost for sure right there wow i would have felt really bad we could have got tied on at least but anyway we got three games today the car is nice i like it a lot feels a lot more like the dominance than it does the octane to me but it is octane hitbox so it's the best of both worlds if you like dominus if you like this car if you like octane you probably like this car so yeah it's pretty good i'd recommend getting it if you guys don't have it already hope you guys enjoy the video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment subscribe let's get on the next one i love y'all you
