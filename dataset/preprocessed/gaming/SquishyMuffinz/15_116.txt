yo what's up guys so after a very long season and a lot of grinding pretty much a whole year of playing a bunch of matches we played over 850 matches this entire season which is more than i played throughout over three years on cloud9 which is crazy to think about one year with energy i played more matches than three years with cloud9 that's insane to think about how much we had to play this year um so we're gonna be going over the replay from the rlcsx championship so the championship this year was only within each region so europe had one and they had one they were 400 000 tournaments so for winning it all we secured ourselves a hundred and sixty thousand dollars but three ways obviously split between three players i'm gonna be going over the game the final game that won us the championship in a replay and i'll be telling you guys about pretty much my mindset what we're thinking what we're feeling um like our thought process as well how we got ourselves to goals so we ended up playing against g2 first in the semi-finals which was a very sweaty match how this format ended up working was it was the best of three of best of seven so first person to win two best of sevens won the series um so pretty much when they're playing g2 first in the semis we won the first series in game seven they took the second series then we won the third series that was a 19 game set we ended up playing 19 games against them as long as ever competitive match of rocket league 101 minutes long of gameplay insane super super hard to play against them for that long they're an incredible team that was a harder matchup than the finals in my opinion ssg is obviously a very good team but i think they looked a little bit nervous in the finals or they just weren't playing um you know as good as they could be probably because the nerves if i had to guess because it is a very tough thing to be used to the nerves in a final setting in a very big tournament uh but my whole team everyone energy is extremely experienced most experienced team right now like three-man roster in the whole game so um that's definitely what we're built for is the big events and the the big finals and we ended up showing up when it matters most so let's go into uh this is the last game here of the second set so we ended up winning this set four to one and this was the the game five to take the the 401 win over them and garrett gets in the same goal in this game so that's just the spoiler but you guys will see um so yeah this is against ssg in the final which is our star ratings and typical and let's start off the game the first i ended up finishing four to two by the way let's find the challenge it's not bad again keep in mind guys this is the final for a lot of money is a big prize pool involved the entire rca season comes down to this no one wants to make a big mistake right so there are going to be mistakes here this is a good good touch to control here actually really good play in general from us so there's an awkward spot for garrett to be in he leaves it you know he's getting bumped by rentals here calls justin to go for it i call justin that i'm on the right wall justin passes to me i think it's touching control i know i have nobody middle if i touch this middle quick not only in my throwing away position i'm gonna be falling inside of half for a very long time which is gonna make my recovery a lot worse garrett's not gonna be able to follow this up it's gonna be my team in a very rushed panic situation so i decided instead justin gave me this ball i have a lot of space on the wall no one's gonna be challenging me so try to get a dribble touch but i control i touched it above me so i can keep getting touches and i stayed on it now this is one touch away or a bump away from being a goal so it's a really good attempt there i like the idea a lot make that for garrett so another communication thing that you guys won't be able to tell but i know i can't get this i know i have no boost here so i told garrett i'm faking i'm faking and i leave it and gary knows the whole way through you can tell they tried to pass middle which is the only mistake that i've seen so far this game is just because they had no one middle so that's probably um a breakdown of columns you could touch from garrett keep corner really good 50 wins this is huge it's a very very good pass here so really well done from gear in the corner this is what you have to do when you're in a corner like this soft touch to yourself single jump 50 to get by sip for free and then a really good flip to get by two and now it's redles and i in a uh pretty much 1v2 scenario with justin on my right as well i know sips could try to bump me that's what makes this awkward so i pre-flip try to get there as quick as i can touch to the side and then justin calls right so i try to pass this right i get killed see i don't even know what happened here to be honest i don't remember because i never saw it very close actually a really good uh attempt here super close and garrett's really far back which is right of him because i just got killed so you want to play this as safe as possible challenge from garrett good touch to myself really good touches there hold on honestly i played this yesterday and i don't even remember doing this this is really good so i'm last back here for a second this is my my duty to control this ball and put it into a good spot it's actually fake red i was there i went fast and i slowed it down jumped over and flipped to the side and then flipped it middle and sit blast back in a very tough position so this is a straight up 1v1 you can see where it sips at you can see where garrett's at at this point it's a straight up puffy one right and simp decides to bite on it that's really all he can do i mean he could have played a little bit more patient try to stall time for his team to get back but end of the day playing garen in 1v1 like this i think he knows he has to go quick or he's screwed to be honest that's tough that's tough you're had no boost though so if sip knew that gear had no boost he would have played this a lot different but i think he definitely thought he had boost here he goes for a straight up shot and that's it third man went for it that's the first goal we got in the the championship winning game kickoff i got his mid boost which is huge that's huge and i got in his way so had garrett won this ball right here tough one to win because arsenal played it really smart does something sgg are really good at doing they use the field wall so again because i took sims boost and i bumped him and metals was falling off of a bad touch um if garrett dunks this ball somehow that's why i turned up the wall there because if garrett duncan's ball is gonna be going to the left side here i'm gonna be able to redirect it or just finish an empty net so if you dunk someone's a free goal that's a really well played uh touch from arsenal you can see he uses the field really well here doesn't go for a goal right away because that's garrett's blocking hits it off the wall it goes for a shot might have even been a pass man i can't tell that's a good play from them let's go for the reset oh my god he poked wait what wait what i didn't even see this he didn't get the reset so it looks like he tries the pogo he i think he did it on purpose he tried the pogo i just go for a shot here and he got a shot on goal i don't want to get this doesn't be anything too crazy as long as it makes them panic and make some ways boost make some jump throw it back to my team i'm gonna end up getting possession here in a second i think as long as i challenge ship you got it back best two of them out of the play and now they're in a rush spot where they kind of have to make a decision and justin read it well let's hit this away except there's no option here you can only hit it back wall retouch for garrett there's no danger in a double touch there it doesn't matter who the player is attached from riddles follow so i gotta wait back you want to have any boost not in a dangerous spot by any means good touch from garrett try to read the bounce down save from garrett take his time so good job to be patient here from garrett i mean you got to look at where sip jumped instantly for this ball he's never going to get a perfect shot almost never is he it gonna be top quarter so it just it ends up being pretty much around where the ground is by the time it goes in garrett barely hasn't even jumped for it it looks like it could be a threatening situation but it's not because it just stays grounded impatient all right very good play here as well this is a communication thing yeah it gets the touch here i call him off i tell him i'm getting a double i got two and then i go for a shot as well and it's actually almost a goal sip barely gets back to this i want to see sid pio give this yeah he didn't expect me to get it over him so that almost got me the goal alone the unexpected double that i kept close enough that i could follow it up that close to almost to being a goal wait what a save wait what the heck it saves my first one that pinches wait that pinch is so fast and he actually saved it oh my god this is a good touch uh from us here i know i know they're gonna be both blocking the net angle there's no way i could score this i know they're both gonna be blocked you see how they both turned toward net angle there's no way i could actually score that so i hit it around both it was a really close attempt i do this kind of thing a lot when i have the time to if i know i have a potential goal and two people are gonna like a panicked position pre-jumping me i tend to hit it around them it's almost always the better option and my team's gonna be in a much better position because of it because if i just go for a shot here and they dunk me to the wall it's so much harder for my team to read than if i hit it off the wall and that's my purpose and my touch and i already tell them what i'm gonna do and they're already pre-positioned for it like right here you see garrett turns and that's a good save from arsenal should get one more bit of pressure here maybe another pass good save from sip here very hard shot for me to shoot i think if i could take this back as being very nitpicky um this is very hard to to take this amount of power at this angle and get a very good shot out of this not gonna lie very difficult so what i would do instead drive up a quick fake right here take it to the wall try to take their boost if it comes back in time probably won't be back but just take it to the wall keep pressure like that they wouldn't have possession here uh we'd be in a better position offensively but that's very nitpicky and you could name a thousand things per game that would leave you in a better position obviously so i don't like being super super over you know analytical about things like that this is a good play here really good beat from justin very good speed i know sip can't fault us over his head i know arsenal's last back so sip is now the new third man and i make a touch is going to put him in a bad position so what i do is i put it off the wall and that's why we just can't reach and i know gary's going to be in a advantageous position for this ball takes the shot delays the shot well the began very good save simply saving a lot of things in this this final game but you see just how easy this ball is for garrett and how tough it is for them right i'll go and sip to pov so easy just for garrett to take his time take the touch he wants then you go sip pov and you can see how tough it is for him to really do anything there's no way that he could challenge that ball right that's a very good touch to make in that position this is really good too could have been bad but the thing is i know i'm blocking majority of the net here reynolds really only has this half of the net to score on me like back here this is the only way he could score and actually was in but justin was back and that's how rotation should be working a challenge first make them throw away touch make them throw away the play as early as possible and that's just just austin's ball to clean up he's gonna get that every single time let's playing it back it's fine that's never really going to be anything dangerous it's something that it does a lot that um you kind of just get used to it it really is a danger it's something that like a lot of players do i'd say like um even like first killer does this a lot too kind of just tries their job across the whole map it doesn't really do much outside of kill time for their team but it almost seems like they're trying to score which will never happen there's just no way you score something like this against a good team that's challenging right it's like we all just play patient we wait he's wasting his boost none of us panic jess is literally afk um and i just jumped the free freak there's no there's no danger in anyone doing that really this is a tough situation jared just died i'm lost back i know i'm not back for a second here so i try to pinch this to the corner like up to the corner safely like this it doesn't pinch and it comes back out so that's the only one of the big mistakes that made this game but it wasn't bad at all because they just weren't expecting yet very hard for them to get a good shot of that as well justin challenges first here good job and then garrett with the crazy play here really well done i would get pov for this again very good challenge from justin here it's all stems from the challenge and then sip has all this time and he chooses to do the one thing that he always likes to do in a situation so we know how to defend it so a lot of people do in a situation just pop it up go for the solar dribble but it's one of the most readable things when if you go to his pov he probably had more options he had arsenal on the the corner wall waiting for a pass um probably had rebels as well rattles to the right as well so had tim just taken a second looked at his team and looked for options here it would have actually been a really dangerous play but instead he has put a solar irrigable messes up pretty bad and justin challenges as good as you can he just floats floats touches it down garrett plays patient underneath him it's really well done from gary as well to play patient because justin was calling that he had it again it's a flip almost impossible for him to stop once he has that much control on the ball and the ball is that close and he has a flip forever so that's a very very tough spot to get out of can't really blame them we're not getting out of that situation good bump from them it's the communication thing i called it i was getting bummed all right there's an inspiration um me and justin kind of go together here you can see we double crochet but it's not it's not too big of a deal to be honest i beat two with this touch and now i know sips lost back so my goal here as long as i block zip shot or force it high or force it right or left i'm doing my job here i use the rest of my boost to do exactly that i block the whole net if you go hit pov you can see that one that's probably blocked look where my car is there's no way he could shoot this any kind of touch on the on the net here i'd block so that's that's well played there to block every angle and if you go to my pov again here gets over me but again that's fine and justin gets a free touch i go for the bump on ours which is smart because hardest i know is now the new third man in this play so immediately i aim for the bump turn off ball cam i try to jump for the bump i miss it but it's fine we have a two goal lead with a minute 20 left played smart enough it's going to be a goal you touch from garrett playing patiently [Music] here unfortunately i got bumped there if i didn't get bumped here's the goal for sure my momentum gets slowed so much so much i can't get a very good shot on it very good patience they are garrett deals with this situation as well a lot of okay best thing is if you look a lot of their offense is just typical trying to like solo dribble us or 1v3 or 1v2 they weren't using each other very well but this is how they always play so in a final scenario i think you really need to use each other you really need to not let the nerves get to you and try to take over the game yourself you got to be like play as a team and you know try to be as as much of a unit as possible and i think we knew how to play against a team that's doing something like this over and over again so garrett just fakes gets the ball for free and there's no danger in that play at all and justin somehow beats it to that i don't know how i'm not going to lie i think you faked them good bait there and it's just like really well played to like deal with their their solo dribbles and stuff like this as soon as i as soon as i force the flick i just leave that's really good play just a challenge a little unfortunate challenges go our way but we have to play out this next situation while garrett gets faked here actually really good play from riddles to fake this another solo play situation i just play patient hold my nerve let me get out of it well it's all about a spooky this is a good play though jumps quick backs off gets a fake on one yeah i just i just played it super patient didn't have any way through the only way to get a goal there is if i make a mistake and i challenge too early very good challenge from justin there i'll play let's see what garrett did here very good touch so something so simple looking i like this as well you can see the little things how important they are he checks how far arsenal is with his right stick very very good idea here so look how much space he knows he has how much time he has to beat the last guy back and he plays it off the wall and one of the most awkward spots for the defender and justin's gonna win that every time and like justin does it as well you can see it as well right here he looks for the last guy back i'm gonna finish hold on 37 seconds left three goal lead gonna be pretty hard to lose this one at this point but you could see how we're playing well as a team are communicating well it's a very good dunk very good read as well all their solo play attempts we're stopping them the right way challenging the right way communicating in in ways that like we know someone's gonna be following up if it gets past us look at the situation right here even if this gets behind me garrett's back wall garrett's gonna have a touch on that like you see how he's ready to cover me if that goes wrong and it doesn't go wrong and it almost leads to a goal for us so we have everything covered in these situations and that's exactly how you have to play especially in a final scenario where um you know one little mistake and you're gonna get scored off it's a good bump there i actually don't know how this isn't a demo right shouldn't that be a demo i don't know almost it's so gold though 20 seconds left i go for a little pass here to garrett soft touch and you can see that pov how hard it is to read it looks like i'm going faster this ball last second i turned away past the garrett finishes it off sit pov again looks like i'm going fast back off last second 13 seconds left at this point we're smiling we're having a good time we're happy and we know in our minds that we're uh we went into the season all the hard work paid off got ourselves the dub and uh another rlcsx in game title which you know you guys know if you've watched me for a long time i always like connecting the
