yo what's up guys it's going to be solo queue except 2v2 games for today we're going to get back up to the rank videos let's see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right so i couldn't find a game just queueing two so i decided to queue ones twos and threes and we got ourselves a threes game so let's get into it we got ourselves lefty and golden first daffy jacob and snoop all right pretty early morning match here as well it's 11 a.m pretty early for for rocket league ranked most of the ssls and like really high ranked players get on much later than this so i don't know if we'll be running into any pros today played around one dunk the other one looks really good there trying to get back quick here i'm gonna be the last man so i gotta play in this barber i can react to whatever comes out of this that's why i kind of just waited back post there because you can pretty much react to anything you do that really good demo i would have had him been i think i had to go out of that so he pretty much saved a goal there let my teammate challenge first i'll be last man back we had to flick that's fine gonna have attached to the wall here despite if you touch that should go straight to my teammate essentially the pass to him at that point bump the other guy as well i don't think lefty expected it so he couldn't just straight up challenge for the bounce here nice click the shot at first played off the wall should have a shot now close actually pretty good try i can take my time here that was awkward just go straight back and try to take a better angle at the ball it's always going to be the better play than to rush it or like try to turn and get a really quick touch and really need to do that most of the time but see how most of touches i'm going for are like all putting my team in better spots every single time it should be a goal now don't know if he shot it fast enough oh good i'll be waiting back now big challenges i'm just gonna sit under this so he has to flick right here my teammate should be back play to the left now uh close again they're doing a really good job but when they're coming back they have one guy just kind of cutting out whatever plays for me just smart trying to play it to the wall to my teammate really good way to keep pressure i wasn't sure if he if he'd missed that or have it so i kind of just wanted to be there in case try to take a better angle again take an extra second to like go back a little bit more give yourself a little bit of a wider angle to cut in on it's gonna help you out a lot go for some bumps here make them all jump those guys life's gonna be a little bit more awkward in that it's a good challenge i don't have to give away any of my position for that i'm just driving into it being annoying and we stop all this pressure lefty got a little bit antsy and like pushed up a little bit early so we kind of lost a little bit of it but it should be okay still but for his next touch here nice really good pass good job to look for me there he's done that twice now in that same situation he's looked for me middle which is something that not a lot of players do so it's a really good habit that he's already in so yeah it's something that's so underrated just the ability to know where your team's at and actually use them we're doing a good job i haven't really made um any major mistakes at the very least this game not gonna go for that take this mid boost just chill big challenge here make him flick go back now team i should have for free should be up now all right that was pretty fortunate i got the bump on him i hit up the wall for my teammate should be there no one was unfortunate could have maybe been a goal but i mean i get why they're a little bit passive there because we already have a lead as well oh imagine take this mid boost shutter standard spot where i can react whatever really good try on the shot get safe from them they're getting bunched up on each other so i'm just going to drive into them not only does it like eventually get us the ball back but it also gets that demo there which is pretty big it's gonna be an awkward situation nice again the extra second of just waiting ends up giving me a much better challenge on that ball i'm gonna be up for that let my teammate have now take this back boost all i do is just sit right here too if i'm on defense i recommend just sitting here because you can pretty much react to anything so i want the ball to come my way no matter what this shot is even if it's wide too it's also a good thing if it's wide because you can react to it as well so i love doing that i'm just sitting right here options.net are so limited all the time finally got some full boost we have a goal lead normally in threes like if you have a lead i'd recommend just hitting the ball once if you're trying to really get away and hit the ball once rotate all the way back that's like gonna almost guarantee you to win every time because you'll have a last man back for sure so in a situation like that you'll be back for it it's all about just having a someone to defend put it off the wall here wait for his double maybe i try to get into the same spot just in case because if he got dunked there the situation gets a little bit uh tricky for sure yeah pretty solid game like our whole team played pretty solid to use each other when we needed to and it's all you can really ask for but yeah against the next one hopefully we can keep it up get back to my dubs i'm not sure if we're gonna get ones twos or threes but let's see how it goes all right for the last game we got ourselves pika against jake and tyler we got ourselves a two's game took so long to find this match i thought it was gonna be 1v1 to be honest good challenge man just wall dashing off the bat try to bump him for my teammate teammate couldn't actually go so that's fine if you waited there should be a hard shot for him to actually get on that unlucky so my teammate would just wait back post all you have to do is like just sit back please the shot's never going to be fast from the guy coming in so as soon as he goes for that it kind of leaves me in a really rough spot it was never going to be a tough shot to stop but most people do panic in a situation like that and they think it's gonna be harder than it is so i definitely recommend like even i was talking about last match if you just sit on the back post or even the front post it doesn't really matter sit in a spot where you can get momentum pretty easily most of the shots aren't going to be good enough where you're going to have to pre-jump or panic like almost all shots aren't going to be good enough i'm not going to lie doesn't matter even if you're playing pro players most times they're not going to be good enough so i wouldn't recommend pre-jumping stuff especially when they're coming from like an awkward angle like that good shots from my teammate though it's crazy eating slowly here this touch should have the ball take control of this plate to the right side around one if he doesn't go for it i can go for a bump i don't think my team should actually go though because i don't know he i don't know if he could have scored one so maybe he could have didn't end up too bad for us take my time here played to the wall around one played off the wall tried to hit one more around them couldn't fight that the challenge take this mid boost here let's sit in the spot where i can react because it's probably going to get over my teammates so i got to be in a situation to react to that single jump 50 and i could stay on it again because of it so i don't waste any booster really i don't waste my position and i'm in a spot to help my teammates so it's pretty much the best case scenario all the way through there could challenge my teammate as well make him hit that ball over me give him a free touch good save again look at that situation right he didn't pre-jump [Music] pretty tough shot to save i'd say but he like stayed in a good spot on the ground he's able to just easily save it away it's a really good example of what i was talking about uh if you didn't bump me definitely i don't think my teammate expected that guy to miss as well russ would have been a goal as well for him should be easy for him let's go behind [Music] it's fun i thought i look like i'm like super patient on on defense really i'm just waiting to the last possible moment to challenge everything that's all i'm doing so just be annoying here nice follow this up hit it to the side i know one's up for that it's only reason why i'm jumping quick if i can stop the situation before it's even unfolded you know it's always gonna be best best case scenario my first flip it's fine i'm just hitting it around me you may should have my back wall here easily just control to the side backwards always your friend as well never forget about the trusty back wall what it can do for you on defense all right this is a awkward situation because i'm getting bumped here i gotta take a little bit extra time to go back should have one more touch out should be okay my teammate just goes nice i'm gonna flip you sound this good save i don't know if you can get back actually should be able to i'm gonna go straight back for the big boost here just stay back post dodge the bump well gotta be careful if he gets beat here fake jump i thought i forced him high enough once unlucky he actually he messed up his flippy set pretty bad because he actually wanted to get a flip out of that but it didn't work for him and ended up working better which seems to happen rockley quite a bit the mistake works out better than it was originally planned but we're getting so many kickoff goals this game i think all of our goals are off to go just winning the like the kickoff in general and then the cheater getting a free shot that's hard to follow up so i gotta go back wait for his double should be fine again i think like bigger thing on defense that like people don't do especially in lower ranks i find is they just don't use the space that they have because you have all that space going backward like toward your net to use to actually make the save you can wait to the last possible moment it's probably gonna give you an advantage most of the time the earlier you go for your your challenge earlier you rush it the harder it's going to be for you one more touch go for air dribble here gonna block them let's save their defense has been pretty good too i'm gonna go across here try to cover like the whole other side of the field all right there's his own goalie every time he shoots they're like not able to get there somehow he meant picking a really good time to shoot every single time play back right to them they need a boost call i don't know if they did in lower ranks but in higher ranks just means to try to play the kick off into uh their position wherever they are it's fine my whole like role there is just first man so i'm just trying to challenge it as early as possible for my teammate that way you can get a free free save i'd like if you didn't jump for that but at the same time he canceled out pretty early so but if he didn't jump it was kind of like for sure going to be a goal it's going to be a really good situation for us their defense is really solid this game honestly if they didn't make that many mistakes on defense nice all right get set again for today hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you
