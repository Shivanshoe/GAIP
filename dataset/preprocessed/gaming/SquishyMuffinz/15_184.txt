yo what's up guys so i know this is probably a little bit different because i don't normally do facecam videos and uh you guys are probably like whoa i'm actually seeing the guy that's talking it's not just the car um but yeah today we're gonna be doing our uh montage review video so i asked you guys to upload a bunch of montages for me there are a ton of them i looked up the title montage for squishy which is what i asked you guys to upload them under and there's a bunch of them so there's gonna be a lot to look forward to um if there is copyrighted music i probably have to watch it muted but i also try to watch most of them i'm gonna be giving you guys some shout outs throughout some of the best ones i'm going to be leaving some comments so make sure if you guys did upload check your comments because i'll probably be leaving some comments on a lot of them uh but yeah hopefully there's a bunch of banger montages let's get straight into it i'm super excited this is a fun video i've never done something like this before so if you guys like this kind of idea i'm dying to do more of in the future it's really chill um there's really no like stress in it i'm kind of just relaxing there's no like sweaty write games i like that i like being able to relax with you guys and get to see what kind of montages my community made so let's look into it let's see so yeah let me just make the face cam a little bit smaller so you guys can actually watch the montages and let's uh let's search up the keywords i'm not exactly sure how big i should make the uh the facecam for a video like this but you guys don't let me know if it's okay at this size or not i'm kind of just experimenting uh but let's see montage for squishy already pops up there's a bunch of them so let's do let's filter by this month because i asked you guys this month and it's gonna be oh my god there's a bunch okay um yeah before we get to the video guys if you're not subscribed to the channel i think we're

this is just for squishy okay starting off with the ceiling shot [ __ ] off the bed damn you did a pogo damn this is crazy already another slingshot same setup looks like the same match this might be a freestyle only 1v1 that was a nice nice goal as well as a musty yeah it looks like a it looks like a freestyler to me it's a good ground pinch as well there's no defenders for me in a montage if there's no one challenging and there's no defender actually like stopping you from shooting it makes the shots a little bit less quality for me but i do i do like i do like these shots though they're definitely very like they're very difficult to pull off it's a good musty as well damn good angle the fake i can see a fake coming here yeah nice yeah he's actually good he's a good clips nice musty he likes his musties all right we get the idea of the montage it's a lot of like a lot of freestylish like ceiling shots like there's probably another musty i'm guessing or breezy it's a musty again yeah okay so we get the idea of how he likes to play it's a that's a really good monster though it's like it's it's a lot of really good shots back to back-to-back guitar i like them the music's chill not bad at all so we're gonna leave a comment all right i'll leave a comment clean goals less than three leave them the heart yeah rap say thank you for taking part in this video thank you for uploading a montage make sure you do drop him a subscription guys that's his channel name just look it up you'll find him leave a subscription he's earned it and let's move on to the next one that's a really good really good first montage to start off on this one actually has a thumbnail with me in it so this guy put a lot of work into his thumbnail so let's get into this one it has the the old grand champ logo in it it's kind of funny looking 359 for the fake of the century i'm 50 75 and 2v2 what's 1600 330 lasting so this is higher ranked gameplay it's probably less freestyling more competitive so it's something that should be interesting to watch so let's get into this one and uh yeah i want to see this fake of the century here so let's see all right i'm going to go to 359. he said fake of the century he has white alpha boost oh my okay that was actually good i like that a lot i don't know if the song is copyright free or not but look at this he fakes the ceiling shot that was that was a good good fake for sure that's so hard to read the beauty of rock league is behind every good goal it's kind of like this in other games as well like i feel like it's like this in cs as well if there's like a nice 1v4 clip or a nice 1v5 clip in csgo or any text feeder like baller doesn't matter there's a lot of mistakes made by the opponents most of the time in this situation it's the same thing right like this goal is really good but this is the first two challenging this guy should not be challenging this guy also could have just went back and let this guy go so it's a mistake on both of them really so you can look into like things like that obviously but you got to just try to appreciate the beauty of the goal right you can't dig into each goal that deep it's a really good play it's a smart play to take that slow instead of just banging it away it's a good fake obviously apologize in chat as well i like the music awesome straight in what's your goal as well i always toss them around another bump all right let me go back to the start though now that i saw that fake let's see what kind of goals he's got going for us nice double tab i like the white alpha boost it's vibey i have no idea how you use white alpha boost must be a mod or something oh a triple on the floor it's actually a very interesting way to shoot that i feel like it wasn't trying to do that but it's actually like you could probably do that on purpose in a way make that look good a okay a lot of people look at the last montage and say it's definitely better than this one but the thing is these are all like competitive goals the defenders are actually going to challenge the ball it makes each goal a lot harder to score right whereas in the last montage a lot of it was just freestyle won't be ones or no one was back or just like that people can't really defend the shot right oh the dish nice this is a good montage too it's chill i like how chilly these montages are that's actually a good shot really good shot oh it won't be one the bump it's coming oh i don't know how to put that in still i love how you still use that and the guy dodged the bump he scared him away that's a smart play defender actually played that wall okay the goals aren't bad but i think i think a lot of the goals that are just empty nets are goals that like should be goals or should like automatically be goals most of the time shouldn't really be put in the montage i think he has definitely like some good double taps in here for his rank 100 percent not bad at all we'll move on to the next one though because we want to include as many as possible and there's so many of them uh make sure you guys subscribe to rising star that's his channel name look it up that's his logo and i'm going to leave a comment he put imagine squishy sees this lama i'm going to reply to this with the eyeball emoji and uh good montage brother with a heart well played that was really good really good like nice cop montage it was chill i like how chill it was all right next one montage for squishy i really like his thumbnail here the thumbnail works sick dude the thumbnail on this one bro i can't believe i'm i'm looking at this it's crazy the thumbnail this thumbnail is really chill i like this what thumbnail stands up to us okay we can't listen to this one because of the music so i might skip over this one we'll see maybe we can listen to some of these with no music we'll see the thumbnails are nice though you guys did a really good job with these thumbnails you guys are using tournament pictures why is just who put justin upside down up there dude nice a lot of nice thumbnails okay let's go back to the top here we can't watch every single one we watched the first two because they were the most viewed ones uh but there's some other ones that have a lot of views here too this one has a lot of views i don't know why these ones popped up first but uh let's watch this one the thumbnail is really nice oh okay you can tell his mechanics are clean already this is a banger okay it's gonna be really good montage these are all comp clips it looks like too ah maybe the opponents look slightly worse than him then it doesn't look like i can't tell he's got very good mechanics though it's a good double those doubles are really satisfying when it just flies off you yeah he might be like a freestyling casual for a lot of these very good pinch he's got good good mechanics double reset maybe triple that's really clean and the defenders aren't challenging super early in a lot of this so i don't think this is comp it's a lot more time there's a nice double good angle what a pre-jump the double damn this is a good montage this is clean doesn't matter if these clips are in ranked or not this is clean double again it's very good at those wall doubles musty double in the corner damn this is a good montage definitely the best one so far and that's no offense to the other montages we saw for your guys's ranks the ones that we just watched you guys are very good very good montagues you can tell you just have very good mechanics oh those are clean the 360s nice ceiling pinch double off the corner these doubles are good this is a good montage another double off the sidewall breezy i can't tell if it's a ranked or not that's the only thing that's making me like skeptical if i want to make this a 10 out of 10 montage of my eyes nice double reset it's really good goals mechanically is very very very very good montage thanks for watching i could tell uses movie maker like i do because it's scuffed at the end there the the black paneling gets all glitchy that's that's what happens to his movie maker hopefully i can keep this uploaded regardless of music i hope a lot of you guys use copyright free music that's the only way i can make these videos all the time um because some sometimes if you use copyrighted music it actually doesn't let some of you guys in different countries watch the video and that's like my worst fear i don't really care about not being able to make money on the video sometimes it's more so just i don't want people in other countries not to be able to watch the video because of some music some songs do that for some reason um but one second make sure you guys definitely go subscribe to fandom this is probably the best montage that we'll see today i'm not 100 sure on that but i think it's gonna be hard to beat those shots in terms of just straight up quality but we'll see maybe something will surprise us make sure you do it the subscribe button and make sure you do just leave a like on the montage as well because montage was a banger so i'm gonna leave a like on that 100 i'm gonna say very clean montage 10 10 out of 10. i'll leave my heart as well very good stuff all right montage for squishy i i gotta like pick different ones here i can't just go in order i feel like i should pick different ones but at the same time i don't know dude like there's so many like there's so many here that i just want to watch i wish i could just make like a five part video of doing this but um let's just watch the next one let's just keep going in order for now and we'll cut out the best ones all right montage for squishy best of mj let's see he has freestyler camera settings you could just tell yeah this guy's about to hit quadruple resets every single time okay i was mistaken i was mistaken we might not have seen the best mechanical montage i do you might not have seen the best one at this moment what might beat it i could just tell immediately from his settings that he's a freestyler that does like a bunch of resets this is a long intro though best of mj alright let's see here bro the fortnite decal i messed with that what are those wheels stall reset off the ceiling i like the passing plays is it double oh one's up again three men three-man what okay that one made sense this one does not make sense what that hit the side of his car okay he's cheating i was speedy this is a good montage too i really hope this song is copyright free as well man damn the sun go hard damn these are clean i got some very talented viewers though damn all right i get a lot of this my only problem with this kind of montage is the defenders don't really challenge so it's pretty much like free play that's the only thing i don't like about these montages but you can't deny the mechanical skill very good very good flippy sense of musty double damn it's your goal i'm picky though man i'm picky when it comes to these monsters i'm picky because like again this goal is really good but high level play someone's back wall it's easily saved right so you don't see this stuff in high level play a lot of pros are very capable of doing that like i could pull a lot of the stuff out from one of two like the flippers and muskies and stuff but it's just like the amount of boost you use for how like useful it is in high level play it's not as good it's not as good as something more efficient right but it looks really good but the defense normally isn't playing these situations very well in these montages obviously because they're not playing high level comp very good goals though you can't deny these goals they're really good oh pop them into it yeah i saw that is it double damn actually good that's creative double triple nice i like i like those a lot i saw like i've seen like jaser do this a lot where he like drives into his teammate and his teammate like bumps them into it with the pinch and they can double that isn't straight in but sometimes they can double off of that damn then on the beat drop and everything pinch all right pretty good montage i'm not going to watch the rest of that pretty much got the gist of it but hopefully squishy will see this i did see it man mj everybody who is watching this right now if you guys enjoyed that montage make sure you go subscribe to mj right now hit the big red button and uh yeah i'm gonna leave them i'm gonna say 9.5 out of 10. i was clean as well but i like the i like the way the other montage was like clip after clip after clip that's clean as well though i just don't think i can give it a 10 out of 10. i'm going to say clean and i'm going to give them a heart 9.5 out of 10 on a tosh that was really good montage as well all right let's uh let's move on i'm going to pick a random one here with a thumbnail that catches my eye i could do another one of these in the future if you guys want this doesn't have to be the last one i ever do i could do the one in the future for sure i'm sorry guys i'm a little bit sick right now i feel a little bit sick so i might sound a little bit different what do we want to watch here there's so many they were skipping wait this one's catching my eye all right the thumbnail on this one dude oh my god how do you fly i like your style kid and then it's a supersonic legend logo i'm in a top hat and there's the spooderman meme guy so let's watch this one month of ncs i'll be giving it a watch editing on a friday laptop so please don't be too harsh all right let's watch it let's watch it this video is on csv squishy i appreciate that appreciate the ncs this is clean oh no way it's the flick toppings not bad yeah i like this this gives me old squishy montage vibes this is like my old montage you like if you also suck at carson i'm sure you don't suck this reminds me so much of my old montages my really old ones this makes me happy for some reason i love the vibe of this montage it reminds me so much dude [Music] oh one of these car colors oh double tap double tap this this guy's not bad what is he saying these are clean damn that's like your goal as well man not bad at all watch this fake okay i'm watching oh i see it i could see it the vision yeah yeah damn we got three that third guy very impressed yes i like this montage oh double double surely nice flick them clean air dribble another flick you know what the 180 lord brick i better hit 10 subscribers on a set can we guys okay i'm gonna pause it there he's at eight subs can we get him to 1 000 subs would that be possible would you guys all do him a favor come to his video his name is lord burke that's his picture and drop him a subscription okay i'm gonna hit that subscribe button too why not let's get up to 1k subs because this montage is sick bro i love this montage i'm not gonna lie i can't comment but i love this montage so make sure you leave them a subscription i think you'd really appreciate that sick montage man thank you for taking part in this video let's get into a few more we'll watch like three or four more let's see yeah really good montage but i appreciate that make sure you drop my subscription lord burke what is this what is this thumbnail bro montage for squishy in brackets diamond there's some girl with her butt out and then there's uh octane some breakout air dribbling at the beach all right i clicked on it and the quality is a little bit too bad to be able to record it and then show you guys it so i'm not going to be able to watch this one but i appreciate the work in the thumbnail okay i definitely do appreciate the work in the thumbnail but i appreciate that and uh the only issue is the quality is a little bit too low to be able to show it and look okay for an upload so let's watch a few more other ones here let's keep looking through let's see what thumbnails stand out to us here i like these ones montage for squishy this guy's on playstation air dribble central non-copyright all right let's watch it let's watch it there bricks [Music] intro maker the quality is a little bit low but it's okay it's hard to upload in high quality sometimes [Music] oh this is all air dribbles yeah that's the air dribble central one clean i thought it was air dribble central not passing play central man you switched it up on me i was not expecting that oh we're back to air doubles not bad this looks like comp clips as well outside of this one as soon as i say that i think it's again against nobody in this clip all right we got the idea a lot of air dribbles one really clean passing plate clean stuff though i like it i like the idea of a montage that's all one thing because you could just see a bunch of just the way you do that one thing i think it's really clean to watch someone who's really good at flip resetting do a bunch of flippy sets in a single montage it's like a really good idea so i like the idea a lot i'm gonna leave it uh a nice eight out of ten clean montage i'll leave my heart as well make sure you check out dare bricks clean montage i do enjoy that video a lot it was a lot of like really clear dribble straight off the bat so i like that a lot montage for sushi you forgot the q um but we'll give it a watch okay i like how it started like straight off the bat we're getting straight into it oh that was clean i like that goal a lot a lot of levels to this chip number one fake the high touch remember flippy set and flipped it in good goal i like this montage a lot you can tell it's comp you can tell everyone's challenging damn this is clean double oh i just think that's fine it's gonna go too not bad dude this is a good competitive montage i can't tell if they're i think there's somebody back there fake again he loves those double tap fakes to reset he's good at those two damn all right clean wait there's another big drop coming up hold on nice coaxer pinch i want to hear what he has on the beat drop here good read let's see the beat drops coming is it flippy set double ah it wasn't on damn it wasn't on the the beat it loses a little bit of points for me there but it's a good montage outside of that right there it's a really good montage annox volo is the channel if you guys want to subscribe drop him a subscription and uh yeah i'm gonna say clean montage brother very clean outside of that one beach drop i can't spell outside of the one b drop that he missed there very clean stuff okay some clean thumbnails some really clean thumbnails here this video is a troll

bands pinch damn nice i like the secondary angle in case you missed it you never know you never know maybe somebody missed it right all right no one doesn't net for that but i think he's just practicing his ceiling shots clean all right dude the music's clean too what can you say you know i mean clean montage that was clean that was clean well done make sure you're dropping my subscription if you guys want it's harry b vibin zero and good stuff man you're working on the ceiling shots that's what i like to see all right let's watch like two more here okay i i have to i have to watch this video montage for squishy it's my face all distorted i have to watch this surely i i can't not watch this not sure if he will ever see this but i'll give it a try the video is low quality due to syria human restrictions okay let's watch it i have to watch it i'll watch a couple [Music] here double tap clean no way dude clean stuff clean stuff can't lie to you galaxy this channel if you guys want to subscribe sick montage brother all right left them a comment sick montage brother and uh yeah clean stuff you guys want to subscribe like i said his channel name is galaxy that's his profile picture let's watch one more here one more we can't listen to that it's definitely copyright also copyright can't listen to that one let's keep looking what is this this thumbnail some of these pictures are so old dude i can't listen to so many of these because of the music guys if you want to upload these montages make sure you do it with non-copyright music that way it's easy for me to listen to i'm not even sure if some of the ones i listen to already are copyrighted i'm checking a lot of them but some of them might be still dude there's no there's no chance i listen to this montage of squishy use my own clip [Music] this is my first ever video that i uploaded my first ever rocket league video he just re-uploaded it one of my first aerial goals like a month after the game released actually maybe less than that maybe like two weeks that's a banger try to watch one more there's no way right this guy took a picture of me it was me and my girlfriend that i think i posted this on instagram or twitter or something and then he wrote these nuts on my face and what looks like paint so let's let's take a look all right raccoon league is his channel his channel name is raccoon league leave a subscription if you guys would like to very good montage let's watch one more all right we got three thumbnails back to back to back here with me in it so we got this thumbnail i'm very confused i'm very confused what i'm seeing here so it's me with an x across my face then a ball with question marks on it and then some guy with what looks like a bulletproof vest and then there's this one just my head cut out and this one from just the land um let's watch this one let's pick this one because it's just a fake montage so it's gonna be fun we'll see this guy breaking a bunch of ankles here this is a good idea for montage fakes are like some of the most enjoyable things to watch in rocket league oh that's clean actually that's like a good idea it looked accidental like half accidental i don't know you missed the bounce no surely not that's a fake has to be a fake there's no no chance that's an accident oh big fake here's two of them two of them are gonna go flying surely oh okay i like that idea too i thought he was just gonna stay next to the ball and they're all just gonna fly by but that works he's faking in the right spots a lot of times a lot of these are like mistakes from the opponents but he's faking in the right spots okay copy off guard this squeaky toy all of what a fake is pretty much of you guys are in the lower ranks a lot of you guys might not have even seen fakes honestly because we're not playing in lower ranks for road to grand champs or road to supersonic legends now i haven't done one recently but a lot of the low rank players don't actually get faked by stuff because they don't know what's possible they don't know what to expect so a lot of it is just like you rush at a ball in a scenario where the opponent has to pre-jump and if they pre-jump it you just don't hit the ball pretty much this is all it is you're just like you're rushing to a ball then you stop quick in a position where they have to panic so you kind of use their panic to your advantage like that right there you kind of have to try to challenge and if he doesn't challenge and you have a free goal and if he challenges like that then you also have a free goal but fake nice he's like he knows what not to fake too which is good that's a hard thing i was gonna play kind of just outdribbled him all right clean montage clean monster you guys want to subscribe it's how to his channel name is how to i hope i haven't been covering all the names with my face cam i'm not sure um but yeah leave a subscription if you guys do want to uh subscribe to this channel i'm gonna leave a comment here we go all right get to the next one last montage we'll look at one last montage this one actually looks like it has a lot of potential okay this guy i've heard of the name nexus obviously like nexus is a freestyling group i believe so it's amazing squishy nexus misco or mexico i'm not trying to say that 2k mmr freestyler so this could be really good so let's watch this will be the last one and uh let's end off on a banger hopefully hey squishy if you see this i'm a comp freestyle for nexus and i'm 2k plus mmr enjoy double tap this is going to be a good montage i could tell this from his name being a nexus visacon freestyler is going to be good that's a good goal ceiling yes double reset looks like maybe triple nice google this is going to be the best montage i think of the whole video surely this is all competitive clips really to go nice get the boost maybe go for the wow okay i did not expect that i gotta learn how to get power like that out of those because that actually could be useful just to whip that out with low boost that can throw off everyone very good and look at that zero second goal what a goal wow that caught me off guard i thought he was going down for the boost nice a musty nice up to the ceiling for a double potentially or just a shot to go reset nice it's a double reset probably how i winning it goes for a triple i like it the confidence really good shot as well those are good if you know how to do that it's really good reset or triple double into a mustang ass another double reset wow pain dude i have not seen a double like this it backflips than a normal way and then you front flips it's another one he flipped the wrong way if you backflip there that's a goal that's close it's hard though it's a really hard one i sit down very clean clips best montage so far easily i'm glad we ended on this one [Music] nice those are clean so flip reset double nice it's gotta be a flippy set again surely nice double nice very clean goals this is my kind of montage back to back to back clean goals every single time there's pretty good defenders for the most part they're not perfect but there's good defenders in all of them very very clean i'm gonna drop them a comment best montage i watched well done and yeah if you guys want to subscribe it's nexus mesco man's very talented he deserves the subscriptions make sure you subscribe
