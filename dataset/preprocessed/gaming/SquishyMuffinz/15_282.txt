guys gonna be caring so to stay with Garrett G from energy should be some good games before we get into them I just wanted to say thank you so much for all sakura-chan oh you guys have been absolutely

been pressing that big red button everyone has to subscribe to me for a very long time thank you so much for loyalty I appreciate so let's get into the games for today should be some good ones let's see how they go alright the first game you're playing is melodic injuries these are - we're having more players will see this go so they put a lot of to use as well I believe that Dre's a guy is pretty high up there on the the won't be one leaderboard as well so we'll see we'll see how this goes won't be one get for a while could've maybe score - it's a little tough trying to pass like at 3:00 I'm some reason it's pretty risky of me to do to like your deal with this behind him let's find you in back smart play from him till bull should I kill this guy's law close I missed the demo was on me close it say from him plenty very patient defense was able to react never gets thrown their way they playing it pretty smart trying to throw it off his face for year I sometime do he wants me to have it again one more City does close they're just barely getting back to all these saves but they're doing it it's working nice I think they're about to say that again a lot of pressure though from us had a lot of good shot opportunities over and over again I play low there we go notice he's on the backboard there so there's like no reason for me to shoot that high you're gonna save it every single time so I faked I was gonna go higher then I played it to a low spot where he couldn't get it it's a really good pass from Garrett that we gave me a lot of room to work with good kill on one nice from kid we're just being super aggressive it's working I'll show you the expect me to go for a kill there but it was good because even if your dad missed this I'm gonna be anyone to follow up for a free go I'll show ya like it still definitely come back is your very good to players for sure you don't want to give them any kind of room to come back but he has many goals as possible and tried to fake a shot to the far side and then with a low on the opposite very tough to say that yes the guess where I'm shooting right just makes her really hard I figure to go first they bumped into each other I'll just go nice the close first attempt not sure what I wanted him to do I wanted him to play off my my flipper set as if it was a fake almost worked me all the way back she turn that's fine I just let him play with it alone he's going back to this half anyway so he's gonna accomplish very much like that try to kill him Charlie kill him or maybe pretty jumping it's good for us two minutes left to stop a four goal lead maybe five it on suck yeah pass from gay the first game I was super solid didn't have very many opportunities to come back but I guarantee if we do put them again they're gonna be super solid the entire to the next game it's gonna be super close down through very and so let's play one more game hopefully we'll put him again because it'll be another tough matchup but I think it'll be a lot closer to the next one so yeah let's see how I guess all right for the second game point against what is this guy's name really do be looking for team though anyway playing it's waking this guy who do be looking for the team though em [Music] then I kissed a dog you'd no problem bad start backing off for me I was later to hear I was alt-tab I noticed wait guys hi i'm mr not sure the end person is Wow okay I just come for the bump okay a lot of time to come back both the girls are in that great doesn't feel as if we've been outplayed in the first thirty to be honest very winnable game positivity is key technically I wasn't locked in this car cuz I could just drive away no no technically I wasn't rule number one or whatever you want to call it whatever number you want to call the rule you're 50 there we go a little bit awkward I'm bug gear waited on me though he trusted my I play there I played it so patient I just try to flick it to the top corner maybe last one no problem I control to the side should be easy forget it want to see your dad paid off the wall like that I reacts to it look decent 50 I think I missed ya then that stuff should definitely sort it better stuff so you go for it try to keep pressure doesn't have a one b one needs a once player so i don't want to want to give him too much space wanna challenge really just going to go for this probably got the killin one just good if you can win this challenge would be huge you do it but I can't really challenge it go now so she drops up off this car that's my green light it's my I like to go for those see the desk it's gonna be awkward touch it'll forget it's gonna keep it in you getting very risky there but I kind of have to make some sort of play it's gonna catch them off-guard because this little awkward when it's awkward scenarios where if that you have to make a risk for it to be chance of scoring or not getting scored on you gotta make it a risky challenge got a bump on her action that's not quite a bit no boost I just wanna pinch this back down to me Oh what the hell somehow I backed I don't even know I was one I gotta try to get back now cuz here dad got very very awkward cuz of that here we go it's a very like 1v1 base game so far comes down to taking your time when you have it taking your dribbles properly it's all it's really been so far oh the one sent over for the demo on it as well just popping it I got his boots just good I can go back now oh yeah good challenge it wasn't too much risk in that and you gotta be behind me nice turn from good try I gotta put passive mu way from them maybe help me out oh I think you'd go right away who's fearless lots of a completely fearless in here there we go good block 28 beasts here she's gonna bend this over his head take his boost as well this would be good good time to start up a play moving forward even though I died there it's fine I got his boost I could play off of this flick should be fun he's gonna go someone will wait here it's fine never gonna really hit that shot perfectly every time free ball for Gary and Emily pretty good for us this is fun trying to play it smart I want to get the money three opportunities so I might even be able to get something out of this potentially Oh close yeah keep up plus good attempt good pass and get lost a fake coming to go left side here on a bang it there we go past from gate well done well done that was a sweaty game for sure but we put it at wool they got two early goals and I knew we could come back from it didn't really feel like those goals are huge mistakes on our part just like little things that went wrong let's empty net stuff like that so not better to hope you guys enjoy the video have yourself a wonderful day or night
