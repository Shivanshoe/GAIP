you know what is up guys I decided to dedicate today's video to something very important in terms of trying to learn to become a better player and that is how to properly manage your boost and a bunch of tips that I can give you guys to improve in that aspect of your game there are so many different things that you can do to improve on this and me myself as a pro players play this game for about 11,000 hours at this point if you had my Steam hours on my ps4 hours 11,000 hours with a game play and I can still get way better at this thing there is no limit to how good you can get at boost management and I just conserving a boost and knowing when to use it and when not to use it that's something that I'm still to this day working on and something that can get far better at and so can every other pro player in this game no matter what prank you guys are I'm gonna give you guys every single tip that you'll need to improve on your boost management skills and just being able to conserve your boost and use it in the right times while also being a fast player you know what I can serve you boost and never go for the ball you wanna know how to conserve your boost but also go for the ball at the right times and be fast and keep up with the rotation of your team so that's a hard thing to balance and we're gonna try to go through it today and I'll show you guys some of the more important tips some that you guys may already know and it's something you guys may not know but I'm gonna go through all of it regardless so let's get straight into a private match right now and I'll show you guys what I want to talk about all right guys the first up I'm gonna apologize because in the background you could probably hear my furnace which kicks in randomly every like 40 minutes and sometimes it happens to turn on when I am recording and you guys hear that sometimes in the background of my videos I have no control over that whatsoever I really have no way around that yeah my setup is in the basement which is right next to the furnace which unfortunately is extremely loud and there's almost nothing I could do to get rid of that sound in the background I've tried my best but that's probably always gonna kind of be there it's been there for like three years but if you guys are wondering what it is I've seen comments about it that's what it it's just the furnace randomly kicks on especially in the winter here it gets cold yeah so but I wanna start off with for this video is where the boost pads are on the map so this sounds like something that's super basic but if you really take a second to look obviously everyone knows that there's two corner boosts all right to mid boost and then to corner boost again so yeah what I notice a lot of players do when they start playing this game is they know where all the big boosts are the two corners team is in two corners again they know where those are obviously and then they kind of just let the pads get picked up as they as they go you know they just get lucky they will go over the pad sometimes get themselves some free boosts on the side that's good sure you know if you want to just go around that way not exactly knowing when you're gonna get the little boost but what I would recommend is no matter what rank you are go into a private match like this just go to overhead view zoom it out and just take a look at the pattern here so you can see there's rows of three there's multiple rows of three there's one there there's one here it's a little bit off another one another one and another one another one I think there's five one two three four five six rows of three and then there's one two three rows of two okay so you want to kind of memorize that I'd say like kind of have a mental image of where all that is I'm gonna show you guys the best path to take on the way back if you do go for a shot and you trying to rotate back quick while also refined remaining the play there are several different situations for all of this obviously like if the ball is going a certain way you have to react differently it's all situational but I'm going to show you guys a bunch of different paths here that you can get a lot of boots out of and actually it's pretty quick and you don't have to go out of your way to grab a corner or a mid boost because everybody on your way back and that's the best thing about these is you don't have to get rid of your position for boost your position still remains the same and you get a good amount of boost so each of these little pads is twelve boosts every single of those is twelve you so a lot of you guys probably really know that but I'll show you guys right now so each of these is twelve boost so you take one of those as you can see my voice went up by twelve and the second you take one of these three seconds later it pops up again so these have a three second respawn so let's count that out real quick one two three pop up again right now there we go so those have a three second respawn it's at each of these and then the big boost here have a ten-second response so I'll go over to this big boost I'll show you guys that so we'll take this boost at 353 that means that when the clock gets to 343 this big boost gonna pop up again so that should be two-one-zero should pop up right now there we go so that's something that I have started to do and habit doing for about like six seven months now where I would grab a boost I got this mid boost at 332 I kind of just a mental note that's been taking at that time and then I'll be back and goal here now I know if I go for a challenge here it's just gonna pop back up and like one more second so it's fine I know I know I'm free to go for a challenge is gonna lend me on the left side because I can grab that one that's kind of like thinking super far ahead and that's like kind of a really high level thing that I'm not sure how many people do but that's something that I kind of keep a mental note of in my head the 10 second timer 3 second timer you don't notice that as much because you kind of just you take that pad and it's like behind you and before you know what it's ready back up you don't notice as much but I'd say the 10 second timer is something that you should to some extent keep track of but while you're playing you kind of have like a mental note of how long it will take before another another boost respawn especially over time you just have that kind of game sense you don't need to think about it too much you just kind of know alright so we covered the the timings of it so let me just recap real quick for a little boost it's 12 boost per pad and 3 seconds per respawn for the big boost 100 boost obviously per pad and it is 10 seconds per respawns alright so I decided to restart the private match with the unlimited timer so what I was gonna talk to you guys about next was the padding so this is something that I find really important and this is ignoring the big boost I'll show you guys some really useful ones getting back from offense to defense so so you go for a shot you land right about here the beach pads you just take are right here you start with that one take these and just flip back and now I miss one there but look at what you said if I got this one as well that's 84 so again I'll show you guys if you land in there goal which happens quite often you go for a 50/50 or whatever you land right here so you land with no finish right so you start with this middle one right here this is the most possible amount of pads you can get on the way back and you're not really going out of the way like you're not going out of your proper position to grab boost you're gonna be in the mid field so you're gonna be able to turn if the balls coming toward you you'll have a decent amount of booze to do so so going back here your teammates probably be going for this ball at this point just line up for this you can boost a little bit if you want throughout this but 84 boost and I'm back and I can just grab two more and look at me I'm mid field full boost and honestly I didn't waste too much time like at all and the good thing about this too is that you don't even need to get the footage really you could jump to the ceiling with about 55 boots so all you really need to maintain pressure take these ones take these ones turn right here look how much Bruce to have in this position I I have just gotten 72 boost not having to go too far out to the corner not having to go to that corner not having to go to that corner I have been able to stay midfield grab 72 boost and now I can jump for literally any ball I could jump for any ball that gets thrown up setting like that's a huge huge thing to have in your arsenal regardless of your rank regardless of where you're able to score right being able to have that boots and keep pressure that might even like open up an opportunity for you to turn right here and get a free goal because you have that boots you have 50 boosts to use now whereas if you have no boost in this situation you're going back you're not taking any of the pads how do you turn this one momentum and get a good shot it's gonna be a weak shot someone's gonna save that so learning the pads are huge and the thing is to that's that's kind of one of the harder paths to learn and it's not even that hard you really just take the the outer triangle like that and you just keep following it it's not even really that hard to learn right but there's even easier one that's that's just a simple one that everyone kind of does in the grand champ I would say they wrap around here and then they just take these the middle ones going back because you can get full boost pretty easily if I waste all my boost here one second I think you get about 72 boosts I could be wrong from just taking these middle ones on the way back yeah so 72 boosts getting the straight line ones on the way back and that's me spending their boost at all just to get back all you got to do is flip twice it's really not that hard to to get all those and and you know maintain a position where you can easily throughout this entire line you could turn a challenger ball throughout the entirety of you grabbing that path of boost pads so those are two important pads that I would say are very important to learn so in both the situations are going for a shot you land this one you will just go straight back which is super easy you'll get a bunch of pads for free and now you're back with 72 boost and you don't have to go into any of the corners any of the mid boost that's a perfect perfect scenario right there same thing you go for a shot whatever I land here okay I'm just gonna take these probably some boost here to get some momentum and then I'll just take these and look how fast I just got back and I have about 70 boost to use and you can do anything with that boost so now when I move onto a path you can take on defense that's that's very useful so in a situation where you're completely starved out all right so in this scenario you're playing let's say twos or threes whatever your teammate challenges the balls rolling up the wall here you have no boost back they're gonna have a ceiling shot or a wall shot or something so you just take these pads in the diamond and they probably be around here at this point and now you have 72 boost to get up deal with that and you don't need to use much Bruce guys this is a huge thing to you so not only should you learn a couple of these paths you don't need to take the full path as well at all it all comes down to how much time you have if you know you have a good like eight seconds to use sure go go for the the wider pads take more time and getting full boost sure if you only have like three seconds to use here to grab some pads and you have no boost I'll say just grab these grab these grab these and you have thirty six boots to deal with pretty much anything and look how I can get my thirty-six bucks I could save anything within the crossbar if this ball is on target I could save it with literally no boost so if it's a ball that it's unnecessary to use boost for don't use it if you're in a situation where your team is getting out pressure is super hard liturgies don't use your boost you get a touch to the corner and then if you need to jump over here first save that you need to use your boost for that's fine grab the big boots then and move on from then so like you really got a thing situationally right you shouldn't even be using your boots for no reason if a ball is getting launched really high off the backboard there okay I'm not gonna jump all the way up here and use like sixty of my boost for a ball that I can just wait on and see if they have a bad shot because there's a chance that a lot of time they'll bang up off the backboard this ball is probably gonna end up around here they have to bang a shot from here and you're in goal and you're sitting there with a nice hundred boost because you picked up your pads why you gonna waste your boost to jump up for that when you could just wait for their bad shot and clear it on home you'll clear back to this side and they're gonna have a separate ball to deal with so it's really down to like just knowing when to use your boost and now using too much when you have the chance to so like like I said if a balls coming at you when you jump a little bit look at that I used 18 boost to get about halfway up the map literally you're halfway with the map I use 18 boost so you don't need much guys and don't use anymore than you need so as soon as you make that touch stop boosting at that point unless the only situation where you wouldn't do that is you make the touch and you have enough boost to follow hammer man I'm gonna take the next boost and keep going that's the only time you probably shouldn't do that but if you're getting constantly pressuring you know your teammates about to fall off your touch there is no point of you following your own touch and wasting all of your boost and that boost might not even be there right so it's really just the knowing when to use your boost and being smart about when to go up for pads as well if you have 29 boost you really should be risking out going for pads too much but you can go for three of them just as secure that you have enough boosts to save whatever comes your way and again you save a lot more boost if you go on the backboard you don't have to use any boots to get this high you're ready up here you literally just flip it away save all your boost that Bruce doesn't need to be there you still have 65 to work with so it really comes down to just knowing when to use your boost and using it wisely when you have an opportunity to touch the ball don't overuse don't want to use use just a right amount and that just comes a lot of play time honestly also a very important thing guys I see a lot of people doing this even in grand champ once you reach supersonic there is no reason to boost at all you will maintain this speed for as long as you go forward this map can go on forever and ever I will always maintain top speed I'll always maintain that speed right there it doesn't matter what happens to my car it doesn't matter if someone's in my way I'm gonna demonstrate through that I'm gonna maintain full speed okay that's something you need to learn for sure because as soon as you reach that full speed why are you gonna boost and waste your boost it doesn't give me anything it gets you a little bit faster it does it is slightly faster if you boost with this the only reason why I would I would boost already being supersonic is if the ball is rolling like this and I'm chasing someone to the ball because I'd probably beat them slightly it is slightly faster I don't know how much faster but it is slightly faster to boost while being supersonic but it's it's not worth it at all if you're already supersonic that's all you need get there and then when you're turning boost a bit that way you maintain it because look what happens let's show you guys if if you reach supersonic you're supersonic until you turn it so as soon as you turn I'll lose it so how to counteract that is when you're turning just boost a bit and you can maintain supersonic that's all you got to do so just boost until you get those purple lines and then stop as soon as you see that you don't have to boost anymore and you'll see someone like just do this a lot as soon as he is in supersonic you trying to maintain that he's pretty much trying to maintain that speed at all times he'll flip you'll flip to to keep his speed you won't use any boost so maintain is abuse that way you can go for you know some sort of crazy mechanical play because he has that full boost to go for that so that's why you see players you know like like Justin go for those mechanical plays so often because they have the boost to go for them if you don't have any boost how do they go for a flip reset halfway up the map party to go for a double clutch or stuff like that like you really can let's you have the boost for and you know how to use your boost properly so these are things that you have to definitely practice but it's such a simple thing to learn like being able to recognize okay I'm full speed I shouldn't boost anymore very simple thing to learn nothing to get you a long long way like that is that is a tip that a lot of people don't know even even in the high-ranked I'm just kind of sad like I see people wasting so much boost and these are things that will take you from whatever rank you are and literally it boosts your rank like this alone will boost your rank if you learn everything that I've brought up in this video with these pads honestly the reason why I'm making this video is because I've seen a lot of comments on it but I see it a lot playing so look you that people just they just don't know how to use your boost properly and and how do I like save it and when not to use it so if if you're good enough to the point where you can recognize camp full speed here and on top of that you know where all the pads are you're gonna have no boost like you're gonna have no boost all the way back on this end here you flip just to get full speed here then you could literally be full speed while at the same time grabbing all these pads and moving us full speed here but you're also picking up all the boost Jenny I mean like I'm picking up every single boost pad that I could possibly get but I'm also moving at the fastest possible speed so I'm not gonna be slowing down my team looking around for boost you want to have a good in between the mixture of both of those things so that's pretty much most of I want to talk about I went over you know the small pad respawn the big pad respawn and how much each boost contains the pads on defense that you want to take when you have time obviously it's mainly just this big diamond in front of pads here that one and then a little triangle those are the main ones you want to learn so it's mainly just that on defense but I went over and then the the pads on the way back which is it's a straight line and then the kind of triangle that goes out and then back in so those are this the past that you guys should learn these are just like five little mini tips that are gonna help you guys so much and the cherry on top is just this this final one which a lot of you guys probably do now but the people who don't know this is gonna change your game a lot trust me the only time you should be boosting is when you're turning if you're full-speed if you're straight you'll never lose your speed that's something you just gotta remember you'll never lose speed I'm only holding r2 as long as you hold your drive button and never lose speed that's a huge thing that everybody should know everybody should definitely have an idea of so yeah that's pretty much all I want to go over today outside of that it just comes down to you know to your own gameplay and learning once user Bruce when not to use your boost wall excuse me what does not okay that is not what I saw at all I'm gonna leave that the video but yeah guys it comes out to win not to use a boost when to use your boost and just want to use it efficiently pretty much you just gotta learn to use it as efficiently as possible but yeah I pretty much given you guys all the tips I've wanted to give you and I hope this this thing is beneficial for you I hope you guys can take a lot out of it and like I said just go into a replay if you want to you go into private match like it was the beginning just the zoom out nice and wide and learn the learn the patterns man learn the patterns it's pretty easy to learn it'll take you probably 20-30 minutes just to get an idea where everything is but they're they're very clustered around the midfield here you don't really see many outside of the midfield there's just one there one there one there and one there there's not really much else outside midfield so just focus on the midfield ones I'd say there's a most important you should really be like too much around the corners unless you're rotating around for the cornebise but yeah that's pretty much it guys so I want to go over for this video hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever times in here right now watching this like comment subscribe and I'll see you guys all in the next one I love y'all peace you
