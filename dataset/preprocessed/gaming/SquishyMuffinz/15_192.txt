yo what's up guys this video is gonna be a little bit different than usual it's not gonna be like a normal gameplay video i will be in free play the whole time but it's mainly just talking to you guys about uh specific things i'll be showing some examples of stuff but in general i get the question a lot of like how do you improve quick how did you improve quick and the short answer to that would be i didn't you know i spent a lot of time playing this game i think i have the most out of hours of all the pro players in this game right now i have like 12 000 hours something like that if you could buy my steam in my ps4 hours which is more than anybody else that i know of that's a pro player um so what i'd like to say is that nothing in this game does come easy nothing does come quickly and does take a lot of time and even though i do have an insane amount of hours played and i've grinded this game for extremely long time i do make mistakes and so does every other pro player that you've ever watched they do make mistakes and they make a lot of them no matter how tiny they may be they do make a difference in game and there's never a limit to how how few mistakes you can make like there's always improvements that you can make when it comes to rocket league and that's something that i really do love about the game and that's something that keeps me motivated because i always want to keep improving and try to figure out ways to make the least amount of mistakes possible so that's pretty much like the main talking point for today just trying to answer that question the best i can the things that i did personally when i was trying to improve and some things that like really got me to the next level in terms of improvement was mindset that's something that even to this day i'm still trying to work on because in ranked it's hard to have that mindset where you want to take it serious all the time i've always had a bad habit in a way whereas like i'm playing ranked and i'll mess around and i won't take it as serious because it's ranked and i really i don't care too much for mmr i really don't care for like leaderboard placement because in the day it doesn't matter um so that's something that like although it doesn't matter you should take it serious and you should try to use that time wisely when you're practicing right you should try to actually be using that time to learn things instead of you know just like wasting it by going for stupid stuff the whole time that's something that i used to do a lot and until i actually started focusing more on ranked and actually taking a little bit more serious that's why i didn't see a huge increase in skill for me so i would say that ranks if you are at any point in your career in rock league trying to go pro or in general if you're just trying to reach the highest rank i think you do need to take it more serious and try to look at the little things don't get hard on yourself and don't like obviously put yourself down that's something that i still do to this day in my pro career like if i lose a series and i feel like i made too many mistakes so i didn't hit a shot i should have hit i will get really hard on myself and that's not something that even helps i think it's okay to realize and made a mistake but don't put yourself down that's an issue that i still have and that's um something that i'm still trying to work on to this day um outside of that like mentally i think that you have to put in the hours right you have to realize that if you want to get good set a goal and you have to put in the hours to get to that goal it's not just going to come to you you got to seriously like put effort into it and realize where you're going wrong so the last video i made i believe was the ssg vs energy analysis video so that's me just looking at a replay that's something you guys can do on your own time with your own replays something like that and just try to realize where you're going wrong i feel like a lot of the mistakes would be super obvious if you're lower rank it'll be just a blatant miss or it'll be just somebody you know not rotating back someone just wasting all their boost that stuff's extremely obvious so watch back your replays if it's the same mistake over and over again you know what to fix and you know what to work on immediately so i would say that watching back replays is something that no matter what rank you're at will get you a huge huge boost of confidence in your skill realize where you're going wrong and you won't feel so lost all the time because you'll actually actively focus on the thing that you're messing up the most that's something that helped me a lot as well and it's something that anybody can do literally no matter what rank you are you can do that you can watch back replays and uh try to improve that way mechanics are important uh this is a topic that a lot of you guys like talk about a lot i feel like when i see it in twitch chat or um on youtube comments whatever it may be mechanics are important they're not everything but i will say that in all the road to grand champs i've done i've been able to get to grand champ purely off mechanics obviously a little bit of that is me being able to read the gameplay and having a lot of experience in the game and knowing where the ball is going to end up but mechanics alone if you are good enough and our mechanic is good enough you can get to the highest rank off purely mechanics um it does sound bad to say that but it is very true because i've i've personally done it myself i've like turned off my brain and just went strictly mechanics for road to grand champ and i've been able to get there uh so it's definitely something that is attainable but it's it's unrealistic because it does take you a lot of time to get extremely good mechanics uh so what i would say is instead focus on building both together so learn the important mechanics you don't need to know what a flip reset musty double tap you don't even know do all this like unnecessary stuff but i would say stuff like hitting the ball off the wall finding a teammate middle and passing to them that's an important mechanic you should practice so practice the important stuff being able to dribble the ball to yourself um and just like making the ball awkward for the opponent very important stuff that you should practice 100 but i think the like super advanced mechanics like this stuff um unnecessary you don't need to learn that stuff obviously when you get to a high enough rank you can focus on that but i think the more important stuff is definitely like being able to control the ball to yourself and get it around your opponent and also get the ball into a favorable spot for your teammates so that's stuff that you should practice being comfortable enough with ball possession to be able to do that right so just basic flicks are good to practice air dribbles are good to practice stuff like this is good it's not overly flashy it's actually very useful to be able to do touches like this to yourself over and over again extremely extremely good skill to have so that's what i'd recommend when it comes to mechanics just practice that stuff and keeping ball control so in terms of how the game is played right now like the meta of the game i would say the majority of people play it for possession so if you have the ball on you you want to keep it with you don't flick it away early keep the ball on you at all times so if you do realize that you're throwing the ball away every single time you have a chance at the ball and you're doing this every time and that's like your whole play then you should probably try to take more time so in the same situation the ball is bouncing off the wall instead of booming i go for the big hit fake i'll take my time i'll probably fake one guy off the ball i have time here nightfall possession of the ball and i can top benz whatever it may be right so just try to use your time more wisely that's the whole meta of how the game is played right now when you have time on the ball use it wisely um if you can get that pass over your teammate and it's going to be a goal go for it don't pass if it's extremely obvious in high ranks and low ranks will probably still work but in high ranks obviously if it's too obvious it gets cut off but for most of you guys that are watching this you're probably in lower ranks right now and you're trying to learn how to improve so i would say in general just try to keep the ball to yourself and if you get good enough mechanically plus using that technique of just trying to keep possession at all times and just being smart and trying to make the situation as weird as possible for the opponent then you'll get through your ranks very easily and that'll be very very good combination for you to have if you get good at just in general ball control and you know actively thinking about the situation around you um outside of that stuff the question like how do i improve quickly at rocket league again it's not like a one answer if it's all it's very different for everybody but yeah i would say that peripherals in general um they do make a difference some people won't tell you that they make a difference but they do make a difference i played on a 30 hertz tv i started on a 30 hertz tv a big tv on ps4 for 2000 hours and i had switched to pc onto a uh i believe it was a 144hz monitor or a 60hz i don't remember it might have been in 60 yards i think it was 144hz i want to say 144. um i switched to 144 from a 30hz tv switching the pc alone was already better input lag was pretty much gone didn't exist anymore for me but the 144 to monitor made things seem like a whole different game so i know it is hard for a lot of people to get their hands on something like that and it took me a very very long time to save up money from doing youtube and stuff to be able to get my hands on that um but it does make a difference for sure and if you are very serious about gaming it's a very long-term investment anyway it'd be worth getting out i think at least um but in general yeah peripherals definitely make a difference and internet does help help some good internet guys i recently got fiber in my area which means that my internet's extremely fast now but before for the last like five years of me doing this and even longer than that before when i used this game in general my internet was god awful it was terrible it was so bad that when i first played rock league i actually couldn't play an online game for my first couple hundred hours all i played was free play that's all i could play because my internet was that bad and even when i was able to play i had like 300 ping if you go back to some of my old videos that i have on my channel i have 300 ping i believe it was the one 1v1 against lachino who was probably top three best players in the world at the time i was playing him on 300 ping and i won still because i was so used to playing on 300 ping back then that's how bad my internet was and has been for the last four or five years they're playing professionally playing in important tournaments with the internet it's terrible that's why i've always loved playing on land because i know it's not a worry of mine it's not something i have to worry about it's probably why i play better atlant in my opinion but uh yeah having a good internet is definitely important and it's definitely something that can help you improve and i know these are all things that some of you guys might not be able to control but i'm just saying it because in general um it does give you an advantage if you are able to get your hands on it if you're able to you know eventually work toward that goal of having a better monitor a better pc a better internet whatever it may be it'll help you guys for sure it's small things but it's issues that i've had for a very long time that only recently are going away for me so i just wanted to tell you guys with experience that those things do matter if people are telling you they don't matter that's a lie because i've definitely seen how bad it can be on ps4 and a 30hz tv um but yeah i think though if you do play on that kind of stuff that kind of setup for a long time like it's something that you get used to like when i played on 30 hertz all the time i didn't realize how bad it was until i switched to higher hertz but it definitely made me get like an extra level of better i think at the time so yeah that's pretty much all i want to talk about for today i didn't want it to be a crazy video but i wanted to answer that question because that's one of the most asked questions that i get in my youtube comments how do you improve quick squishy i'm this rank how do i get to this rank what we gave me from plot to diamond or what we're giving from diamond to champ and the answers are all over this video all over them every single thing i said in this video applies to every single rank and that's how i wanted to make this video because that answers all you guys questions in a single video so yeah i hope you guys learned something and a big part of it i'd say is mindset realize the goal that you want to reach and put the time in the appropriate time and to reach that goal that's a big deal you can't reach your goal like super insane like reaching you know pro level without actually putting in the time to get there every single person you see that is pro level approach level probably has let's say seven to nine thousand hours and then you have those people that have put even more time that have ten thousand hours plus which is only a couple people i think i checked the other day and the people with ten thousand hours i think right now are torment my old teammate um fairy peak me justin garrett i think those are the five people that have ten thousand hours at this very moment in time like five pro players so i'm pretty sure i have the most like i said i checked at the beginning of twelve thousand something like that if you add up my uh my steam mp is four hours so yeah i've been playing this game for a very long time guys so hopefully you trust what i what i'm saying in my experience in this game um and yeah i appreciate all you guys for watching showing support as
