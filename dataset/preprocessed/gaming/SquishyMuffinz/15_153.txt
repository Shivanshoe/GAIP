yo what's up guys gonna be playing some previews for today with gimmick and our old friend johnny he was actually the person that we had played in the 1v1 that we did yesterday but i didn't want to expose his uh identity so i didn't see who it was but uh that was the person we had ran into but i wasn't sure if he wanted me to say that it was him or not but uh yeah it's him i'll just say because he's playing with us for today so it doesn't matter if he wins or loses so let's get into the games and hopefully we can get some dub see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves against wilt chamberlain um omar and raji all right there this goes i couldn't really challenge him early so i just can't let him have a dribble but it's okay there's really no shame in that not really much that can go wrong and letting someone have a dribble in your corner like that because if you know someone's not waiting middle then you're you're pretty much chilling it's a good joint to get it out of our half feel the danger temporarily way back here get some boost in a good position good pass push forward here fine couldn't quite beat him but should be okay let's save from gimmick try to follow myself good follow-up save there the gimmick does should have this pass over the gimmick side pass back to me couldn't quite shoot but at least i can keep it in their side didn't mean to pinch it like that but it should be fine to be honest gimmick has control of the next touch play it off the wall here an awkward spot for them just see what they do same idea there out of johnny not a bad idea at all i'm gonna bring this one down field see what they do that's a really good touch for us to be honest the vehicle so that's not a bad thing to do every now and then just take a big hit downfield see what happens right put them in a weird position maybe they'll panic hit it up into their own ceiling hit it off the wall badly and your teammates can capitalize obviously in a game like 1v1 or even some 2v2 games you don't want to do that you want to keep possession as long as possible but in three it's okay to throw a possession if you're putting the opponent in an awkward spot that's the way i see it at least really good save there from johnny interesting stuff so i'll play this off to the right side it's a good idea should have this trying to just joint that past the defender the last man back couldn't quite though play it to gimmick side for the touch nice i'm not gonna go for this one it's a little bit awkward he's gonna be up first so better to just wait get the touch after the fact always better to play in a situation safe than sorry right you don't you don't want to go for something that's gonna leave your team in a bad situation let him go for that's fine still a full boost and i'll be back in a good position after this touch from gimmick a little bit unfortunate good good read from them to be honest also i have this person added so i kind of want to see who this is the wilts person uh let's see view profile oh it's sathya okay so he's an ex-pro player he used to be on space station for a little when bit retired try from gimmick should be okay even if you missed this is fine you make small to clean up gotta get over one here that's enough i'd say not a terrible outcome good save from them just head straight back now get some boosts along the way wait for the shot here pass over to gimmick side good pass back good 50 on two of them proud to be there for the next but good positioning from gimmicks you ready for the 50. all you can ask for there he knows all i can do is fix that or that's on the right side so either way he's going to wait middle right no reason to be anywhere but a little bit across from me there best case scenario that's a good shot from them unfortunate straight in off that let me see that forehead all right first touch here gotta follow that up maybe get one more that's from gimmick i'm gonna take their corner boost here i think give me some try to go for it as well but it should be fine i hit it around two of them couldn't quite i'm sort of gonna be in a pretty good position to be honest i have a full boost midfield wait for this next touch on the ball look that up high see what he does that's gonna be awkward read for him good touch there let's hit it off the ceiling middle should be fine nice good touch to the corner been a pretty sweaty game so far not gonna lie it's been a lot of uh close calls on a lot of things try to put that middle again it wasn't quite enough to my teammates so he wasn't able to get a straight up shot on that but it's fine still kind of work out for us here just hoping maybe i can get a pass going forward there but it's a little awkward so can't blame it for not coming through gotta play at middle for johnny get speed if i play it through the wall there close let's do a play good attempt let me go all the way back let me see in the mid boost i know you can turn for me i can go all the way back here it shouldn't be dangerous situation gotta go back now it's a little bit awkward good save not working with much boosting situation like this but i know there's gonna be somebody there to help me out so it could be fun just to hit it down rather kill that then leave the ball in a risk situation you get scored on can't really beat him here so i'll just let him throw away the ball don't mind the situation either it's fine just letting them throw themselves at the ball gonna give me an advantage in that situation get off the back wall should be finished there we go all he needs to do there in almost every situation is just get a slow shot on target it doesn't even need to be perfect it's a matter of i gotta pass all the major players that can make a difference in that play on their team so all you have to do is focus on getting that ball anywhere on target it doesn't need to be fast it need to be perfect just need to be on target and he did that so well played from gimmick get the next one stephen keep it up get back to back down let's see how it goes all right for last year playing it's moshi race and renzo try to just get in the way of this it's a good 50 over the gimmick to bump the last guy back here i got on the back wall a little bit uh hopeful of me but if if i was able to get it that would have been good for us good block from them all played got a bump one on the way out here i like to always look for one on the way out i think it just helps a lot in general with like keeping pressure and stuff like that i don't know why these guys don't have to be on it it's quite the risky thing to do to just be like chilling on another person's half like that when your team's getting pressured if you're on offense it's okay obviously but in general you don't really want to be just hitting on one half like that way back wall here kind of just camp it you could say from gimmick i can grab this back boost now let's say for gimmick again good dunk for them people are getting really good at reading stuff on the wall like that it doesn't really work as well when you hit it up the wall and try to follow it up yourself you got to kind of do something more unpredictable these days i got low 50 unfortunate there's so many options there and i have to kind of take a weird angle at that because i have one guy going for the bump there right he actually backflipped he messed up so honestly i could have waited an extra second and probably just gotten the goal out of it but okay that would have been two guys committed into my neck one guy backflipping one guy going for the air dribble there so might have actually been counter attackable and even scorable had i played that differently knowing that he missed the bump but the fact that he even went for the bump was enough pressure on me to make me rush my play like my 50 worse than i needed to be so that's why it bumps even if you don't hit him super useful thing to do in threes even if it is annoying pretty jump from gimmick should be johnny's ball to get hit around one it's gonna be there it's fine the little touches i got so quiet so i was just focused on the play the c9 passing plays people they're coming back can i fake this here's somebody up on my team i probably should have went myself there but there is a chance that person that's up that i heard could have had a really good shot so you got to give that an opportunity to happen as well well played here from johnny right behind me worst case scenario i can scoop up the 50. pinch it across by accident it's not really what i wanted but as long as we have production still i kind of do not a bad situation better around two of them kind of they pretty much won that engagement let them touch this i'll just be annoying get in the way hit it off the wall delays a lot of time my team can get boost getting a good position to fall off the next touch all you can really ask for there take his boost go for a bump on the rotating back guy make their life a little bit more difficult bump that guy a little bit it's gonna delay rotation but looking for little things like that it's such an important thing to do in threes it's a good touch try to just launch a shot on goal and have a teammate middle i saw my teammate across so it's not a bad idea to go for what i did there also i'll turn back on my controller overlay i just keep forgetting but i see the comments about it take our time here thought i got a good banger to the wall again everyone's really good at reading that stuff now but still is enough sometimes i played off the wall go for their boost take our time here nice good finish that's a good moment to take your time caught you awkward yeah most people just guess when they have someone with a random name wait all the way back here full boost could be awkward but wait in a position where we can follow it up get a shot on goal as well it's a good 50 for us all right i got keeps back flipping you might have his dodge that's in a little bit too low or something like that so you give me going for the bump there so that was kind of my um green light to go for that ball it's kind of like him telling me to challenge and try to take a shot there when i see him leave the air dribble and head for the bump that's a good passing game a really good play we got in this game to be honest madison beer by the way so now he's trolling wow now he's trolling back and trying to get him to believe that he's aqua aqua's a 13-year-old uh up-and-coming player for any of you that are wondering who it is they're talking about very interesting i can get back for this i believe never mind we'll play i should have pre-jumped at the wall maybe but i just don't think there's any way we could have done that yeah now this this game has just turned very interesting b word surely we don't throw this right there's no way i should be dead all right good games i hope you guys enjoyed that the video for today that's a really good passing play to be honest it's a hard thing to pull off against good players i know how to read the play so well played from us hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is it guys maybe watch this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
