yo what's up guys gonna be solo queueing some twos for today let's get straight into let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game of the video we're playing it's creams and shadows we got ourselves dries on our team all right this is the sweaty first game let's see if we can be done though winnable window but also losable put a row one there we go we play didn't throw away the ball kept our flip wave dash on the floor that's all just staring at the opponent i got to do a eye tracker video huh i've been forgetting you guys see what i'm looking at when i'm playing i got something that used to be a highly requested thing i don't know about now huge 50s could have just shut off a bit but it's okay might still work out another huge 50. all right i'll take it just gotta launch into the ball that's smart again we got our flip we never even used it we just threatened the fact that we had it extremely good 50. taking a drink of water oh it might be a goal all right we got it delayed enough time for me that's a good job for my teammate i'm not gonna go for this all the way could be a goal for them nice keep thinking they're gonna shoot better than they than they do oh my teammate just got the boost i think yeah oh no he didn't that's fine for a second might be a goal still though all right we're chilling i'm just gonna keep saying it might be a goal because they just don't score when i do close all right might be a goal for them he's gonna miss because i said it 200 iq take this to the boost hit up and leave you have to get a bad touch teammate should go hopefully nice baited out a good touch room no boost here it's fine i'm fine with them rushing that sturd last minute i should say not third to use the plain threes all right this is an awkward situation all right i got bumped for some reason their other player was internet when he was dribbling but no bump from him to be fair no idea he was there works very hard situation we got the the 50s teammates in there where i should go it's fine so baited at the touch okay it's not that good but it's also not that bad because i can't shoot off of it i work spun my teammate into it stay behind there's no boost figured that played to the wall they play from us actually really a past teammate couldn't be close though smart play with him not to be close i think don't always have to go for the goal in a situation that's just a smart play to play that passive he's gonna have that patience from him i'll just bump or bait out the ball here play from us 1v1 now close should go again huge 50. got his boost which is good all right he went as well actually might be bad now he like bumped me a bit as i went i should just went back when i saw him turn on the wall might be a boom from him all right hopefully this boost comes back it did alright is a terrible situation he bumped me off the ball yeah because he went on the wall as well i don't think he saw where i was i knew it was gonna be really bad as soon as i saw him driving there he just bumped me off the the chance of saving it you should go nice that's a really tough spot to be in all right he missed i'm just gonna shoot this i think i missed it's going to go up though it's horrible oh it should be a goal that's too much pressure good job sorry if you guys hear me drinking i'm super thirsty right now i'm parched is that the word parched dry mouth sounds right nice i didn't need to flip again there i was just trying to scare him into jumping early and making it easier for my teammate it's a good play i could just fit through this now i don't need to go for the goal it's going to be more dangerous and if i actually went for a flip reset or something my teammate can threaten the next touch hit that around him probably again shouldn't even know for that there's no point really because even if i beat him teammate's so far back like it's not going to be a goal ever but it's our corner teammates should get that i always try to decide your teammates that way you can follow it up it's not just in dead space with nobody around tim it's behind me so i know i'm okay to just put it slow try to speed up the ball not bad at all for us it's fine made him jump again just by driving up good 50s i'll play this back you could take it now hopefully good 50 from us that's huge might be the game winner should be down i can't really do much about this i'll just go for this no flip dude i want a zero second goal so bad i felt it in my bones it was coming it was coming if i got the flip all right good first game though let's get to the next one so you know there's 21 for sure let's get into it almost 2100 mmr i think we got quite a bit of points off that 2075 or like top 30 right now it's not 20 something like that let's get into the next one's even keep it up they go to go all right for the last game of the video we're putting it to roco and floater we have a jungle book on our team all right not sure who jungle book is not gonna lie but maybe he's an absolute legend we'll see we will see full boost back here when you go get speed it's fine it's looking like a legend not gonna lie so far looks confident good play i can't like full commit on that though i gotta be in a spot where i can get back in case did you get the we don't know which they did should i get the bump on him get patience i realize he doesn't jump now so next time i know just to go for wherever he is i don't have to worry about jumping into it or anything so i just learned something off that which is good it's gonna take little things like that like that you can learn throughout the game and just like use them in light game situations it's like a super good skill that i have i feel like it's going to be a goal not much i can't do teemo has gone for a very long time i was trying to kill time for him he was all another half still when i was getting shot on the first time so there's absolutely nothing i could have done there the over state is welcome is the saying right i think it's okay to be aggressive like that in a situation but like realize when it's time to go back and help your team because if i have no booster he doesn't know i have no boost probably but even then i'm not gonna 1v2 the whole time it's gonna be really hard should be scorable honestly i'm not going to go for this hopefully all right he's just taking time for himself smart got it over one but it's difficult situation to do anything try to just shoot here i always saw my boost hoping there was another boost there but i should have looked first okay could have been bad i'm gonna get bumped here it's a good play try to pass the middle i should have swim for the shot myself in hindsight off the wall huge fake you know bump though oh he didn't get bumped actually nice we had ice in the end good play for my teammate actually is a really smart fake it was a good shot as well forced that a tough save from him and i just slot the the angle but we did it try to place to the right side off the kickoff my teammate couldn't quite he did the same kickoff it looked like i could save from him it's over it's fine play this right side might be a goal my perception was off if he was that mid boost that would have been a goal the timing would have been good i was gonna challenge him time did really well close jim's playing well though in terms of like keeping the ball close to himself when he has a chance to it's like a really underrated tough skill to do consistently so good on him let me get some pads here it's fine i can put his back now shouldn't be too risky gotta watch out for the bumps here that's all the only thing that makes that dangerous i went for this shot honestly but super super tough angle to shoot it's gonna be one going for a while chuckle's obviously pretty good at these he missed surprised he missed that honestly got back to it i got fake super hard about the miss that happens to me a lot i always expect everyone to shoot everything perfectly which is kind of a bad trade of mine expect too much of people he eventually jumped again like i said that i learned earlier from him not jumping but just not jumping there seems so weird to me so i always assumed to jump also a bad habit of mine when it comes to trying to bump people teammates shouldn't go for this it's too risky it's smart of him to wait it's fine been out the ball my teammate misses this is gonna be a goal against but i think he did a good job this is a really awkward situation i'm trying my teammate to spawn you can just go for me at this point i might be bad now we're good oh my god i thought he's gonna go for the boost he was leaving it for me but just pre-jumping good read too much is going for everything dude there'll be a little boost here it's actually a really good situation for us it kind of messed up his control actually really good spot for us to be in that they're gonna be praying for overtime here i think yeah they're just struggling really hard to get out of there half for boost over one if we had more time i think we end up scoring here so your second goal is doable oh we got it there we go yeah they're in a really tough spot there like i i had a feeling like i said if we had more time we probably scored but the ball stayed up and we got the goal anyway yeah it's in the opposition guys we finished off at 2084. let's see what that is on a leaderboard probably pretty high up probably pretty high up let's take a look 43 not bad so everyone actually gained a lot more points since last time i checked because last time i checked i was 24th at 20 30 something like that so it's been a while i don't really take leaderboards often uh so that makes sense it does check out actually wait we're over here we're 30 it didn't update yet we're 30 um what is this 37 would be 37 38 would be 38. so yeah not bad at all hope you guys enjoyed like i said see you guys on the next one love y'all
