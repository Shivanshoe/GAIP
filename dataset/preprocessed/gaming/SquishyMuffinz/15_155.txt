yo what's up guys going to be playing some twos today with gimmick we're using the brand new ford f-150 car sounds actually gave me a coach i was able to use this early for the first time ever today we only played a couple games with so far so i have an idea of how it is but i'm not sure if i like it or not yet to be honest the turning feels crazy fast to me that's the only thing that's like really weird considering it's a long car but it feels almost like a dominus and the octane if i had some weird baby uh but it feels really weird and i can't really put a finger on exactly what hitbox is but we're using the the decal that comes with it and the wheels that come with it as well all right we're playing it's austin and hash here i think hash might actually be sip on an alt i'm pretty sure it is i think hash is actually typical on it alt used to have an alt account named hashmay or something like that so i think it's him yeah it definitely is him it's not like the way he's playing right away i get so and they're like pretty close friends these two so i could definitely see that being him a little unfortunate there couldn't close out the the double tap let's play this back here like i stay on it it's fine mess each other up too so it's going to give me a little bit of an advantage here to be able to get back killed one about to kill the other good save from gimmick there good try from sip pop it over one let him go for that that's fine it's gonna fake the first touch here it's fine i forced him to throw away the gimmick i don't really mind that situation at all got this and cleaned it up pretty easily it's safe from him this car feels so weird on some stuff man so hard to get used to me just make sure i appreciate it is him could check really quick yeah yeah it is him unfortunate goal to give up right back get to work so hard for ours and that's what theirs ends up being but that's the the beauty of 2v2 you never know what you're going to get when it comes to that stuff and there's going to be a lot of terrible goals there'll be a lot of empty netters it'd be a lot like 1v1 in that aspect a lot of the time in in twos something that i actually don't like about the game mode is how much of those empty nets happen and stuff like that except like never challenge that's where he never challenges his first man like ever that's something i don't know why i even tried to flick earlier try to pop early or anything like that hoping gimmick would go you can't go light defend i get someone who's very good at flicks like that it's just not gonna work the ball propels way too quick way too close to the net so you're not going to be able to react there's just no way kind of the same with flip resets it's kind of the same concept let's try close to being a goal wasting a lot of his boost even trying to go for this i can block him pretty easily good win from gimmick there not gonna be able to get a touch on this unfortunately i got bumped a little bit it's actually all he needed there the try from gimmick should be a goal for me most likely good conversion on the the slight mistake he didn't have much of an option you have to get a touch there uh and just went off his back wall almost got one of those terrible kickoff goals back they don't feel good scored no more getting scored on by them not gonna lie it goes both ways get saved from i'm gonna dribble him a little bit here delay his rotation back to net make gimmicks life easier making a play forward wow that's just going to be the goal this is going to be it isn't it again we got it okay i tried so hard to just slam that in and i'm missing because of it one of my many curses in this game i try to shoot everything too well it gets me scored on but then i go do that so make up for it somehow that's nice just works just works somehow some way let me get a decent kick off here play to the same side with the boost finance if you get the pinch gonna be free ball for a gimmick good 50s i'm gonna have 70 or so beasts going for this over one not bad let me go back here none of the boost came up for me unfortunately but he knows i have full advantage here i just gotta watch out for sip pumping almost got the bump on him that's fine at least force him to have to go to his wall it's gonna slow down the play going forward at least just a little bit nice i'm gonna make it safe i have to trust him a little bit there even if it is scary even if it does look like i might get over him you have to have trust good trade it's actually really good trade jimmy can win this ball he does forces him to a very awkward spot good play he didn't flip it all in that play won all the 50s him on top of the ball i'm gonna fake jump here make him panic a little bit kind of have to do something weird trying to get out of that situation i think it could go again but it was enough to definitely catch me off guard i couldn't get back because of it a little bit unfortunate a little bit too all in i think in that situation had a little bit more space to deal with the fake jump and make a play off of it and since gimmick one it kind of forced the whole play to break down a little quicker than i would have wanted but we created a 1v1 here might actually be just straight in off of the the pass down but really good finish from gimmick really good job to be there and get that goal off the pass the n2 that's the thing like what gimmick did there is not bad for threes and he is still primarily a threes player and i don't think that's close like his level of which he plays threes is a lot more than two still um something has a bad play at all in threes like there's really not a lot of risk to what he did there in threes but in twos very different story a lot more risk to it uh because obviously if that gets countered then you know we can just get scored on super easy like we did uh but goodwin against typical and obviously uh austin's very good as well very high level players and playing for a lot of a lot of years now uh so yeah let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up get back to bag of wins probably them again see how it goes all right for last game played against ajax and t bait so we got a sweaty game here let's do something crazy let's start it off something nasty something nasty we're going crazy we got my skates oh didn't work out nevermind going back i messed up gimmick a little bit there i didn't realize that i got too crazy sometimes you gotta slow down you gotta you gotta tone down the craziness a little bit save my boost here just toss a high shot on goal it's gonna make him have to waste boost he has to go to the back wall here only really has one option bump would be pretty huge stick him out of the play for a while give me him 1v1 here maybe good touch from us actually a good pass on a bad pass it all day good safe from them give me some have a free ball most likely here so i'll wait left side and get that so i'll leave because you don't notice that i'm leaving and just get that so my car's body language type of thing is gonna tell them everything i need to in that situation without us even being calms me just leaving it the way i did give him the information he needs there hit that weird form wait for his touch i'm trying to get his boost here bruce is pretty vital in this situation that's why he was rushing for that boost like he was it's fine really good block from us has no choice but to get a soft touch there actually really good for us got the boost big boost grab i played off the gimmick shot hold on that's a tough shot to get to be honest like stuff like that it looks so simple but getting that shot is very tough for your underrated ability i'd say give it a nail shots like that that's from gimmick i think he's a little boost the way he's handling the situation he looks very low put it around one here see what he does and just bait out a touch here same situation pretty much block my whole goal angle so you have to kind of hit it around me and that's gonna get gimmick free ball that we're looking for dodge the bump well really good 1v1 play maybe even a goal here oh my god nice shot holy that was a really good play he just won't be two to mine i don't have to do anything maybe it's the power of the the fort here just like emitting hours across the lobby try to control this i'm gonna fake the bounce let the bounce come go for the 50 again if you lose a video like that it's better than honestly winning it winning it if it's going to roll to the opponent that's not really a win is it put over one try to play that back to gimmick i try to land in a way where i can just pass it back to him would have been a good play back wall here i can't really get there might have helped him on the pinch there let me get some pads bit out the touch that's all i needed to do just get him to make that pop i can rotate behind that's so unfortunate that it just bounces like that to be honest wait a minute that was my chance make it a 1v1 and honestly it was unfortunate for me more than it was for him because i would have had that same pretty easily if it wasn't that bounce we'll see how this pans out here i think we're gonna get scored on i feel like gimmicks low boost is a tough spot to get out of oh my god oh no what's happening finish it off let's go the ford power too strong here because 800 points this is the content you guys love to see all right there you go even though that game was shorter than i would like to be all for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed we had a sweaty first game the second game was quite interesting a lot of weird stuff happened some bloody stuff but overall the car is not bad the car is not bad but it's just weird and it's just very awkward feeling and i would definitely choose the octane of this car i'm not going to sugarcoat it um maybe it gives you that luck factor though i don't know i haven't gotten that lucky in uh quite a bit in this game and i'm pretty unlucky so yeah i don't have much more time to play anymore so it's gonna be off to you guys unfortunately but the next video i promise you it'll be two full games and if there's an early forfeit i'll play an extra one but uh i want to get this video for you guys because the car is coming out today when the video comes out so yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it's when you guys are watching this like comment and make sure you subscribe to try to reach 1.3 million subscribers yeah i love
