for a very long time I appreciate your help you guys enjoyed today's video today we're here with a workshop map a lot of you guys haven't requested me to do this one on my stream so I decided why not make a video on it I think it'll be a really fun thing like a video on it looks interesting so we're gonna play it all the way through and see if it can be done the hardest difficulty I'm not sure what to expect out of this but it should be fun and if you guys want to see more workshop videos in the future let me know because the last ones that I've done on my channel did really well you guys really seem to enjoy them so I've no problem doing more in the future they're fun so yeah I'm gonna down below let's get into the workshop is called hornets nest by DMC I play this now so for some of the other maps in previous videos so let's get into it let's see if we can complete this alright so we going this is level one alright so it seemed you just gotta avoid the wall silly all we gotta do so I could say this actually good practice for certain things like recoveries if you have to jump down here really quick I'm pretty sure if you touch the wall you guy right yeah okay I'm just testing just testing all right I'm gonna assume it gets super fast and really hard there's a lot of you guys that have asked me to do this on Twitch when you tell me about it you say it's super hard and the last few levels get really difficult so we'll see we'll see if we can pull it off it's all about patience I feel like honestly just heavy super patient with this but then again we got to not be too overconfident with this because I really know what to expect when it gets faster I think I've seen a little bit of gameplay someone playing this I haven't played it myself jump once should be fine for these I'm just gonna probably chill here my friend to come unless he gets fast and I'm asked to use a back ball just trying to figure out like my plan of attack for this oh my god steady here it's already faster holy can't do this oh my god I was trying to gun the ceiling dude I feel I'm gonna be so silent just focusing this whole video I like that I did this a lot though I actually really want a map that's like Park Corey I get the jump water wall to get through like there's situations different blocks something about doing this it's just like so fun are pretty clean not bad also I will be linking the the map in the description if you guys want to try it yourself so you can see how hard it is this one is fun that for sure I think there is an aspect of this that does help you improve to be honest terms of recovery and just being you know fast with your car control I know it's kind of fun I really like the idea this one I get the ball every time the isolation point comes up sit right here all right well we got four now I don't even know well before all right I went how many levels are I don't even know there's nothing any faster oh that was hard Olli don't almost reach me instead of no from doing this right like if there's like a strat to this I don't really know like the best idea I'm just trying to go through as fast as possible if you guys have any suggested map so you want me to do for a video let me know I have no problem doing these workshop it is actually really fun be honest oh no I messed up and they're a good break from the regular gameplay as well oh my cut alright let me focus on me focus get the ball are we giving it a chill we're back then you get so creative with this probably not best to say that closest to the wall to be honest whoa oh my god wait I'm scared I'm scared IRA did it we did it what are we on level five nine I'm guessing just ten wait [Music] oh my kick dude this is sweaty holy wait I'm trolling no did I got hardwood uh Oh Mike trying go to quick dude okay I got it together hey I'm gonna focus with her focus I supposed to be focusing the last one but I'm distracting myself also guys I might be a fennec me honestly I've been enjoying the car a lot it's not better than octane to me for the last little bit so there's a good chance I might actually end up meeting this car not sure hundred percent but definitely good chance but you know me one way or another octene comes back around I don't know how I always find this way I thought I was gonna be a Dominus made a couple times now I always end up switching its top 20 I'm sure there's almost no way I'm trolling I drove into the wall I drove it to the one that I already passed dude okay okay okay come on I'm sorry I'm sorry I gotta show you guys the whole process man just turtling on the wall oh no epic probably making this harder than needs to be what try to be fancy but it's what I do okay what you doing you're doing here this probably isn't even the hardest level yeah why it's faster I'm a messing around too much messing around too much focus I do like the really challenging maps that honestly there's a lot of fun I'll put this one up there you got to be quick with your decisions and your movement has to be good alright we're looking good looking good alright that's the end right there no all right I'm a skip I'm gonna skip you guys so I begin this one so let's take you to the pond all right we did it we did it all right I'm not gonna mess it up this time I sided as fast forward that part for you guys because you know what I watched you mess up the same map so many times it seemed level whole this game fast okay okay I get it I get where this is hard huh yeah that one I was just on was even that fast because this is a huge Oh God okay I know this strat now I got to play as far back as possible I think that's the play the further back that it's back wall the better they're more options I did this it right here lissa getting spicy now no oh my okay it's fine I gotta make sure I don't hit the other one Oh Mike no dude are you trolling me why is this so hard this one [Music] dude I don't know how I survived that was pretty nuts actually like matrix one of the walls so hard should be able to make it up here nice okay this is where it gets like tricky these next few tricky breakdown let's take ground there's much as possible to get more freedom to move okay I watch out for the wall that's right dad last time we're gonna close to yet I think there can't be that many more levels I don't think this is getting fast to fit any faster might be screwed level seven all right I'm guessing this ten this gets really fast so I'm guessing oh my I have up the camera switches yeah you have to stay grounded for this what what just happened that a glitch or something I was unfortunate we're doing good - oh my god this is hard you got to be so focused - I'm sorry for not talking a crazy amount but this is so hard and I'm trying to focus what's happening obviously not like impossibly hard it's just like oh gosh did waiting for the ball to pop up is honestly the hardest thing because you gotta make sure that wall doesn't hit you gotta get it before the white thing comes so it's pretty hard to time that properly this is hard this one ok go further back I think Gary did it we did it let's read that last time we could do it ball okay oh my gosh talking we gonna make it oh we made it we made it we could do it sure they're gonna mess it up here alright we did we did it level 8 oh my it is intense oh go back oh wait - what does this take off why is it working check out the ball we're looking at we're looking good Oh No holy you gotta be careful don't hit the wall behind you it's so hard this is really good for your recovery though honestly to get speedy recoveries okay we're good we're good playing impatient enough nice sorry we got the next one level 9 you No No oh my god okay this is gonna be sweaty I could talk the problem is is like not much time to get the ball and pops up you gotta watch out for the walls that come however didn't get ready again nice set of Papa how am I supposed to get this how am I supposed to do that one what maybe I gotta be on the front wall here let the play oh no that's not a play dude I don't know man this is hard you're trying to sell and tell me how far you get by the way I'm curious and let me know your rank as well see how far ranks get in this cuz it's not that hard and obviously like if I did it more it wouldn't be extremely challenging it's just like when you first do it I catch you off guard for sure you have to have a pretty good understanding of how to control your car if you like to do these later levels for sure oh my gosh oh you made a we made it we're good all right level 10 this is the last one all right it's gonna be super speedy now [Music] all right not too hard so far this is fine I think it'll get harder on now though as soon as the balls get introduced it gets tough so honestly it makes it so much harder that looks a good idea for them to implement that because it wouldn't be crazy hard if you were just the walls I think it'd be fun mode if you just did the walls going super fast without having to get the balls in between just dodging be really fun I'm good top oh no this is so our dude IRA give her good do we make it did we do in this last one let's go 23 debts wait that's it we did it right it didn't give us a time or anything but not bad not bad at all hope you guys enjoyed let me know down below what time you get in this I'll link a map for you guys to play yourself but there's a lot of fun it was good practice as well in terms of recovery mechanics and that's to give it a try yourself but yeah hope you guys enjoyed
