before we get into video guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers there are pretty consistently gaining about 1k subs every single day so thank you so much for all the brand new people subscribing here and show me love and support and for all you guys that have been selling me for a very long time thank you so much for the Laura - I appreciate you guys more than you know seriously you guys are absolutely incredible so thank you so much for making my dream of being able to reach a million subs more than possible by the end of the year or the beginning of 2021 either way it's still amazing so thank you so much guys and enjoy this video and the rest of the series you guys are back with this series that I can't wait to be over I really hope that we could win two games today this is probably one of the last times I'll try to win the two games because honestly getting this last game is gonna be almost impossible always gonna run it to a player that's like a semi-pro air pro and they're just gonna be able to carry easily because I'm not I'm not gonna be able to for anything that's really dynamite enemies hit their shots and it hasn't been happening I have not been able to have two games consecutively where my team is can hit every single shot that's been presented to them so I hope maybe tell you that'll change I don't think so to be honest we've won three in a row now winning the first game is losing a second nothing is going away let's hope for the best fan but I think he's the last time I'm gonna give this a try I don't want this to go on forever me to what anyone losing what he won't losing one just forever seem to be the most boring thing ever so I'm not enjoying the series anymore and I think the day I want to enjoy the content than putting out for you guys so this is the last try I'm gonna give it this video right here if I can't went two in a row then I'm forever giving up on getting a grand champ without scoring I'm just gonna score for the last two games to get it and then we'll move on alright well we lost dude why why don't we keep dude oh I'm so sad we're playing against in Seoul - who also was a former pro and we're supposed to win this yeah this is this is the last video I'll try it I think if we lose if we lose this one then I'm just gonna score next game like I'll just for the rest I'll just see what the grand champ and then we'll move on to the regular like high level gameplay stuff never used to do but I can write Ellis gonna be a very very tough one to win because you get literally sold you literally won't be to it easily on defense in terms of whatever shots I can throw at him you'll save easily so see me pretty impossible to win this but yeah I have a really common side none of you guys aren't exactly a fan of me not being able to score but you guys do enjoy some parts of the series of course the whole point how do you guys at many tips impossible but man this is something that in a ways it could make me worse I don't want to do this for too long and obviously I know eventually I could I could get the grand champ like this it would just take me who knows 3040 videos of what do you want losing one when we lose there until I can eventually get lucky and went to in a row didn't mean just like not fun there's no there's nothing at that point that you guys are learning from it rather than see me get frustrated at this games that just feel unwinnable she's the most annoying feeling they're never going into these games like I know the players know the team like the good players are playing against I know that they're more than good enough to easily carry out these lobbies yeah I don't know it's only on the big resorts you gonna make me happy finally getting back to the high level gameplay only just playing high level pro games for you guys again you guys many tips as possible haven't done in a while beside that dude missed the shot that could have one is the series last game to on so sad man could have one good have won this three times over ready nice all right we got a goal thank you of quiet yeah me this would be pretty sad of insular yes this is I don't know not a hard game to win affiliate on the other side of this but we'll see you a lot of time left I'm sure you when's this uh I don't have much faith regardless we're getting it over with after this video either way did we get it over with or we lose a nice just scoring get it over with is like I said happiness is number one when it comes to content man if you're not enjoying what you're putting out why are you putting it out in first place yeah I mean it's the most important thing after all [Music] more I trust my team back for a little bit you get some pads two minutes to hold on to this trying to play the backboard defense to keep these balls close to me like to follow them up it's fine gonna have a better shot for sure but don't count out of that now two minutes to zero for the vault nice they both went but at least they actually make contact on it it's the main thing there this is bad now unless it to make me get fifty nice I'll be back I toss that up give me from him gotta be careful very easily they can come back from this no doubt in my mind sure thing caboose there's some more important thing touch the ball softly you just messed them up a little bit don't want to leave insel with a one-two one-three my teammates I just want to be back and help them out probably not that experience is saving these kinds of shots he's going for it all day back here I didn't know if the B should be back in time this is bad trust my team here but still not a spot I want to leave them in I know I can find that guy not that shot here's the last game better to fit it up to the wall I'll try to finish it on that left side this is really bad now it's old left out what very interesting choice to leave that ball I'm not gonna give up this lets my team teammates what dude wait why didn't they go though why they watching this for so long there's really any if I didn't touch it but I own board but story and if I don't go for that ball why are they watching after so long I guess I should just ball chase there I don't know whatever I don't even care I'd rather lose to be honest and just be able to score have fun for one one video this series limit myself to this torture whatever place all standard guy that's the best tip I'll give you dude I'm proud about today for being there maybe they're gonna prove me wrong maybe we're gonna be able to actually win two in a row here in so we'll actually just lost somehow to me not being able to shoot but yeah you know we'll definitely take that 100% take that but no doubt in my mind we play against another pro here for this last game and I doubt we're gonna be able to win it but let's get into it whatever whatever happens happens who cares at this point like I said if we lose we'll finish it off with you know in the next video just scoring goals of just getting a grand champ whatever is what it is I'll have fun with it and yeah let's just see if we can get the wins though oh we got rolled these dude no way no wait alright we could win all hope is not lost we have rolled days on our team yeah we actually had a pro on our team this is the the game that we've been waiting for this whole time we're plating it's actual another grand champ player but it's all good we got rolled is you have a pro player on a team this could be the game that we needed all along here let's go dude I'm height this is this is the one okay everyone I get why you wouldn't trust them they're the sole standard is a shitshow and I'm going to learn this very quickly on our dude we could still lose this game like for sure no doubt in my mind to the guys in another team our grand champs I know both of them like I know about their grand champs for sure fight them in twos so definitely looser well we'll see don't touch the ball there you never lose it for his team when they're rotating toward it it's a bet have it is partial reason why they lost the last game - there's a bump as well gonna be a crazy amount from my enrolled as being back here best-case scenario nice won't be one kinda way to really edgar which I'm kind of scared I don't leave Argyle aspect is that that's do that makes quite a lot of mistakes but I've seen the last two games nice new mature huge what does he do behind you gonna come to me run one off the backward close fish let's see his Redemption right here Redemption let's go roll these okay dude I don't care you can literally carry just full chase dude I'll let you sit back I don't care I'm gonna try to get this tub we won't have to cheat I'll be I'll be good in the world this is like the universe being nice to me after I just completely pounding me into like a Mossad has ever been playing this game nice well it is touch if I keep it in here back to him turn on that nice touch good job we go along to this dude III full faith all I got to just play your defense I real dizzy with me as well so yeah we're chillin you can even score this maybe in the back 20 min nice goes right to him should keep us in here it's fun trick good time for him to get a bang good job I'm penny B so I get some heads real quick this has to be the one dude they're high anymore as well that guy I think you'd reach grand champ he's up the back will dish it out that pretty easy I don't know chumps really bad for it look at that I'll get the back corner nice turn good job may 30 2014 you for my teammate it's fine it's playing past a day well this is nice good control I'm so glad we cut someone on our team that's solid for a one-seed nice shouldn't be any suggested a I'll just okay I'm on Jim it's confusing me a little bit I should just one probably after that I'm going the wall I'm not gonna be here for that there's no point we have to be the DJ that's gonna stay on this floor forty seconds kill a lot of time here what I do stay on this Oh my whole team went oh my god going back wait a little busy we could have actually lost you didn't trust me to paying that is that it's like prime example of Rosalie don't trust anyone and soulless a turd and I understand completely why now look I never play soul sitter but I never see why people do the press anyone it's because no one else I did the ball 90 percent I the sad truth oh no my taste so far back dude oh my god just drop this drop your shop please make me grin champ off of that please dude I beg 1293 please be grand champ please please no way I'm not great shape off of that dude oh my god surely not surely we're not - OH we're kidding one more one more dude if I lose this I don't know I don't know if I could do another one this guy is green shape at 1295 I'm one or two more I'm so sad I'm so sad man I think the same the same situation still stands here we're literally within two or more it's so unlucky man we didn't get enough anymore to get grant ball for that but hopefully we get someone really good on our team again and we can get the dub and not worry about the series ever again regardless if we lose I think I'm still just gonna finish off the rest of the game just to score because I don't think we're learning much at this point rather than you guys finally seen you get up that for the first time or irritated the game which I know I'm sure a lot of you guys like see in a way cuz it's a rarity but you know that's what Seoul standard brings and it just kind of telling you guys you should kind of avoid so soon I'd say play 3v3 but play standard with friends or just play regular tributes where you can queue it solo but you'll rot you'll run into players that are more team oriented and they won't miss as much - I feel like I don't know you just one of the more solid players in regular standard I haven't done this to grant chipping that yet but I probably do the charred one in there I'm gonna take a little bit of a break from these rotar grande chip series you just upload chill videos where I'm just like playing ranking stuff for a little bit nothing I'll enjoy this for a bit but right now this is not looking too appetizing I honestly didn't think we'd get two wins so far today we're get to get the third now if you want to get grand champ and like I said I doubt it's gonna happen in a row here but yeah let's get into the next game hopefully we get the win if not is what it is we'll deal with the next video and just get the grand champ to get it over with it kaput the journey and say that the further if we don't reach it in the first we got was to mmm our own way without scoring a goal that's not better at all you can't be upset about that's pretty much grand champ - it's pretty much grand champ oh no dude are you kidding me alright well I hope cookies a go cuz we're planning it's another like putting us on the - camera more player for the dub here I figure I should just score man I don't think we win this game I don't know but I just get it over with I don't know they have fire Raptor who's like a high grant player and beast the bone IAM who I know is a 2 km and white player so there's gonna be a fun one to try to win and I don't even recognize my teammates besides playing them tonight and they haven't been fantastic so it's gonna be interesting rookies new open ok I thought he missed been four minutes four minutes to hold off this against two players your high rank in there and the same playing dude literally queueing this together try to beat me I yes I I did tweet out that I was looking for people to queue because no one was queueing they couldn't find the game alright snub I trust you don't defense if you let me down then well played really solid defense I guess and hold my tomates he pulled something off but man I don't know how I feel about trying to hold on for this long three minutes on defense and I'm gonna get killed and targeted probably the whole time nice open wall cookie one of you guys let's go snow dude are you finally gonna do it three minutes 24 seconds please please just keep popping off dude come on snow this is the game of your life right here my controllers ball very nice so 50 another one look if their whole team that's fine he messes teammate up there it's good like to see more of that get everyone off the back Center miss Froy open close close kooky off the back you're gonna have the share I'll get it I hit the corner nice fine I don't have any boots for good fall from snubz notice ye actually the best game is is 9 I think 2 minutes yeah I have 2 game left to go lead wait oh wait a minute I'm gonna score back soon that's fun nice cookie please force them alright two goals two minutes left if you lose this is on me because I could play good defense here I put it on me if you throw this the game's in my control here let's find us close I'll get I'll get I can't go for this No - no Oh Oh easy you steal the line bid minute 35 I'm not confident you hold this lead man nice come on I really just need to be behind them at all times here minute 20 come on please no dude any boost please go for the ball team oh my god I was just sitting on the goal line I can't even hit this I hate this I can't I've been pushed to my limit tonight data my Matt my mental limit it's reached I knew really I knew it loses sleep - that's the bestest at the worst part is I knew we'd lose the sleep I literally a hundred percent knew this would happen there's no way to go along for that long nice nice dashboard I don't care whatever it's not really my fault that was more him that was that was him it just landed on me what do you want me to do at that point I wasn't even tried to score that one I'll just run out the back this point gone too far then I think it's squirt then I'll do for them obviously but if not I'm going for it we need this dog dude oh I was it right there no why are you pushing up for me you like really like throwing on beef and some more just like you're just leaving back oh and the defense this game is bad I really got there just leaving like so many gaps tried but a second I leave defense at all there's so many gaps that's so huge be if he beats me there's to go against and I've no boost any of you Bonnie so just go back nice please one more final touch to miss you go fine share for this it downfield I was a face challenge you just force the ball out it should go sitting there no one's challenging on this display only one don't you save it to anything there's so much wrong with with everything that I'm watching there's so many things I could even name one thing it had the name like 300 there's so many things that on defense is so much wrong with this and I often see like no time to be taking at all even lost yet nice Sun all alive stuff all right that's a huge play so yeah straight middle but no one's there and this might even be a go against us my team's not back somehow okay nice so fun it's not gonna be there probably so bad touch you shouldn't be able to surf what is he going come I think Busan sworn he left it come on cookie you may close the shops to be a little bit faster again dude same thing plugging this shot to be just too slow now then this spot for it yep no all right yet we're sharing each you don't get into it do I can't believe this I just can't believe it man I have to cheat guys I have to cheat it's too hard it's on the store I would love to see what do you guys try this without scoring and see how far you get and see how mentally hard it
