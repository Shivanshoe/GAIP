guys yo what's up guys give me planks up threes for today with chicago and gimmick should be some good games before we get into we're using these black infiniium so it's actually a backus mod wheel you can't actually use this wheel in the real game um these wheels are super nice they're so clean the only wheel in the entire game that's full black obviously it's not in the actual game itself you can only use it through a mod uh the wheel itself is called infiniums you guys are probably seeing that wheel around but it comes in every painted color except black and uh well kind of unfortunate because this beauty of a wheel would be in the game if black painted and for a thing this is one of the first times i've actually ever used this wheel but i have liked it in the few times i've tried it so far let's get into it let's see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing against niskoff coquita and tide alright i recognize all these players they're all super solid i'm not sure what to expect i'm feeling a little bit rusty not gonna lie trying to leave the mid booster gimmick i ended up not even needing it so i'm quite dumb forgot that he had grabbed the back boost even though i've been playing this game for 12 000 hours should be fine i can't shoot off that at least i'm trying to play it through the wall good play from gimmick there that's from cargo waiting on the left side behind him he wants to use the middle here better play that center make it awkward for them again shout out pressure here forcement the ball away to kaga wait for the back wall touch it's fine easy to deal with pass over the gimmick post can't actually follow this one up so i'm gonna wait kyle can go for this now nice good shot hey pass up middle that's a good way to play that situation now i knew i couldn't follow it up but i can also see gimmick trying to follow it up himself so i should get the left side of the field that we have the right powered by chicago the left covered by me and anything on the backboard will be cleaned up by gimmick right so we had everything blocked there there's really no way out for them and that's just the best way to approach the offense in that situation okay follow this up i can grab the boost good try from cargo good finish good clean up from gimmick can i always rely on him to be there good speed from us to beat the guy that was trying to get the touch off the wall there let me get the mid boost here nice from cargo wait behind i thought i'd follow this up myself actually actually i could just bait this i don't really need to we'll dive at it you make him for me end up double cleaning with cargo because i don't think he saw me turn they're unfortunate they're all good that i died there to be honest i could spawn get two pads immediately i have 50 boost actually low roll this over to cargo you pass it back to gimmick oh it was a good play good play that was forming there for sure i was about to pass that back to cargo again i have any boosts here i think emic would know that because he'd expect me to pass that back if i had boost obviously finally just got some get a play going forward here get past this left maybe i'm gonna wait just in case i saw both my teammates up i don't really want to commit for that as well one of those spooky situations where if you also commit you're kind of joining in with a mistake and making it even worse it's not something you really want to be doing try to play it as wide to the side for gimmick as i could not a bad idea there he both went for the same ball again all good though obviously we're not calming kind of hard to avoid those double commits when you're both just trying to vibe and play some ranked right swine should be free ball for cargo try to pass the left for a gimmick get attempt getting bumped by one of them should i go back now i don't have any boost but get make sure you go for me just get in the way kind of troll i wasn't sure if he's gonna go for a backboard touch i try to like freestyle with them loki wasn't sure if he was going to go for a backward touch or just a flippery set or something my first follow-up challenge here wait for the next challenge from nescoff they play from us we should have i can go back ball here clear from us and wait for the past two players to decide that's fine i'm not doing anything else it's gonna make the shot bad just my presence presence alone in that situation is enough to definitely throw the opponent off there it's gonna kill on the mid guy makes our life a lot more difficult trying to make a play downfield i just beat one opens up a lot of space for gimmick here you're trying to pinch gonna fake here same kind of situation trying to make them give the ball away and play mid now find that space again for my team to make a play down field good bumps wait for cargo to go again try to just block here if i can any kind of block is good again it's going to create a lot of space for our team mid that's kind of my whole goal a lot of the time when i'm playing 3v3 is to create that space for my team and we've done a good job at that so far this game couldn't quite pass them on the wall i didn't have enough boost for the situation hold on strong though the two goal lead looks like it's gonna be enough for this game we've done well created the opportunities where we needed to been in the right places at the right time also almost had that uh three-man weave type play super close to getting that to work out yeah let's get into the next game let's even keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right the last game we're playing against i'm ready whiz and zapatos my back wall here should be easy fall for gimmick or played wait for the bounce down here that's fine interesting touch should be a goal for us potentially in a second maybe pass the gimmick pass back kinda have a lot of pressure off this situation still regardless good attempts should be giving spot a win still i'll play gonna have full boost back here it's gonna be there for that so it's fine i could just wait i still have a foot boost as well played off the ceiling again probably didn't get contact but it should be fine we're still going to get a good amount of pressure out of this situation still killed one he's going to be up here on the backboard i think yeah i try to just back out of it once i had made that assumption i didn't want to mess him up maybe should have stuck with my gut originally but it's okay gonna have no boost here also means most likely no play the left side for him good shot good attempt one more touch here good try good pass from us this is a good attempts we have a lot of pressure though and again games like this often comes down to just one mistake it's probably what it'll be in this game as well play off the ceiling for cargo yet again or for bumping the rotating guy back gonna be enough to force a play there we go good work so far and also i would recommend not hearing too much about the scoreboard because to be honest a lot of powder scoreboard works now is are you getting a lot of saves are you just air dribbling a lot because that stuff gets you a lot of uh score so a lot of the stuff i'm doing in midfield bidding out the ball or just going for bumps like that you don't get any points for so a lot of the dirty work type stuff you really don't get rewarded for you know the game doesn't really show you to love for like that right there that pass probably should have led to a goal um and if coco had scored that would have got nothing for it right so you can't really care about the scoreboard too much because oftentimes even if you are playing really well the scoreboard might not show it so it doesn't matter too much as long as you're in the right place at the right time and you're setting up your team for situations like the ones i'm trying to set my team up for just try to create opportunities when you can and you're going to be more useful than someone who's caring about points and just trying to farm saves and you know just trying to ball hog because that's not what playing 2v3 is about it's not what a team environment is about right play as a team play together and try to create space for your team and be a smart team player don't be selfish being selfish will never get you anywhere in a team environment you have a hard time finding a team let alone even being successful on one if you're a selfish person selfish player right i played this off the wall one more off the back wall you follow up there we go good play from us there now the situation where i know i could take it myself because i see the situation around me i see there's nobody that can possibly block the back wall touch i play to an exact spot there and i get the exact same double touch that i was going for it and it's always going to be a goal but it's a matter of knowing that situation and picking the right times to go for stuff like that and also knowing when you have a teammate middle and you can use them in a spot like that instead of way back here you have one more touch should be fine cargo wait patiently you may try the cool steel i respect that i respect it he always has a really good reading though though he can read me like a book i mean teaming with someone for four years will definitely do that he'd definitely read me like a book i'd be lying if i said he can't so i'll play this over the gimmick on the wall try to play it back mid again for gimmick good passing not a bad situation either i could just challenge early here get in the way of it wait for cargo such middle i can't really block this or anything but at least me being up will force a touch to the side that it might not i've wanted to get it's not a bad idea even if you get beat to a situation like that it's a good block for us keeps it in play on a fake jump here i just played around one i still have 20 boosts to work with so not a bad idea to stay on this ball it'd be annoying kept a lot of pressure just by myself there because it'll hold on to my boost and not force a shot that's never going to be a goal right just play at the corner if you don't have a shot it's almost always the best bet play it over to the corner nice still got it but i can't type that's a sick play though again give me going for the the gold steel the reed like i said he's going to get him more often than he won't very very skilled at going for those played across the game try to play it to the right side back to me play back to gimmick back to me again back to cargo oh he ended up touching him back he got on the way to play it was looking sick how to read them here uh i was close good attempt all right good games hope you guys enjoyed the games for today these wheels are sick got a lot of nice passing plays a lot of sick plays in general yeah i hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful
