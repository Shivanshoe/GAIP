yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some ones and twos today the q times been really bad for me so far so i'm trying to q more than one game mode so it doesn't take too long to find a match so let's see what we get ones or twos let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we instantly found the two's game here we got karma on the other team and scrabbles i think that's how you say that against me and the cam we'll see see how this goes take my time here i have the advantage in this play they have to wait for my touch so oh teammate came super close good thing we can get sword on though i would try to pass it back to him you should have played that close especially in twos right because if it gets by you then you're pretty much true so that's not something that i would expect from someone but it happens sometime that's a mistake that just happened if i had seen him earlier i wouldn't have passed that same way obviously i should have been more aware as well yeah and twos you generally want to stay like a little bit further back that way you can react to the clears and not get caught out because you don't want to get caught out into a spot where you can't help your team right so one of the biggest things about twos ah that's a good recovery good save i thought i had a bottom corner of the net there that i can actually take advantage of maybe get to go out of i'm really surprised she follows it up that quickly that's a good play to be there that quick but also if i get that ball past it's gonna be a goal for us right made them back off take my time slow down the ball a lot there use my space wisely right slow down to the same speed of the ball that way i have full control and they have to play off of me and when it gets too close to net like that if no one's put a not available touches i'm not gonna do anything too crazy and put his back now it should be safe to do this and all i can do is hit it across that place forward to my teammate should be a shot here try make a panic a little bit i wanted to play a bounce hit there i didn't want to just throw it away like a bad touch but any touch would have been better than missing there obviously he misses i have this i think ah that's a good bounce for them when it goes slightly down like that i thought it would have been one that goes straight out it was just on the point of the curve where it starts to go down though still the boost from him so pretty much makes the other teammate useless really good shot teammate good single jump fifty there i took his boost as well got him out of the plate for a while so that's what worked out well that went for play kickoff here i'll do the mid boost my teammate i was going to take it but you know i saw him i might just head out to get behind now he's going to be there because i left that mid boost i try to keep the ball into a weird spot he has to jump for this i can take his boost bump him as well to make it's a free ball because of it wait for the clear here go for a shot just keeping the same i don't even want to score this necessarily it's more just to put pressure on them and i put a lot of pressure in you can see my teammate still has the ball and they're half in a pretty good way you can go for me here would have been internet but it's a good challenge it could be fine it might be a little bit risky now because i can't help out but hopefully it deals with it he didn't get the best touch on the clear there so he wasn't able to follow it up himself because my foreign got a touch on it is the thing there too because if he wasn't there wouldn't hit off him would have hit it across to the corner two of them would have committed actually been a really good situation for us but there's no danger when someone just rolling the ball like that in your corner that's why if i ever do that i'm going for a low 50 to try to keep it on the wall and not necessarily trying to go for a goal because i don't think that's something worth going for there i should have i made a jump early nice follow it up forward if you just left it after that first cut it could have worked really well in the past i can follow it up any point during that he's turning again so that's fine i'll just leave letting him live his life played as high and see what happens here make it awkward for him good touch actually look like they should missed fine here you mentioned challenge you're fine i couldn't reach the empty net unfortunately my cut was good if the demo didn't come through that would have been past the last defender so the cut was definitely good there it was just a little bit too far for me to actually be able to follow up right i play a high touch to the corner he met's going again he likes to turn a lot so i'm just not ready i miss your dm a lot here fortunate going for the boost so i'll leave nice alright it works kind of letting my teammate ball chase he just he was like turning a lot in spots where i wouldn't expect people to turn so if you have a situation like that that's happening over and over again you have i'll just pick the back foot try to chill a bit let's say all right good first game there let's get into the next one let's even keep it up and get back to back dubs on the day it was kind of a messy game though so hope the next one is cleaner than the next one see how it goes all right for the last game we got ourselves uh zacchaeus i don't even know how to say it to biana i'm assuming that's like it's pronounced like with the z right i don't know how i got a situation to be honest i sit down i was just locked in if i had an eye tracker i would be able to show you guys i was just locked into the last guy back trying to block his path to the ball if he had any way of actually getting there float by this fine force them into a spot where you can't do anything it's good especially in a game mode like twos where it's a lot of just solo plays a lot of like it's like a lack of teamwork i would say is the best way to explain it you want to make sure you're putting the opponent in the top spot to make any kind of solo play so i'm going to challenge early here teammate went as well but i challenged him to a spot where it's not going to be anything dangerous at all if i challenge when i did this cuts out there play early right you want to have someone just cut out their play and not give them too much space early on the ball take my time here it's fine interesting i might end up being a goal for them i'm not sure if you can get back all right i'm trusting him back hold a challenge for me so i can go next i'd be surprised before cometh on this i'll just stay grounded get everything blocked challenge from him it's fine through the ball away you guys should have probably been there but it works out fine still almost bad fine so i'm gonna kill time for my teammate to get back i know i'm last for a little bit he's coming back though invite to myself let him touch that that's fine it's falling up next which is good wrong with that yeah i couldn't really do anything to get out of the next situation it was unfortunate he did a good job to follow up on that the 50 that i had in the midfield that's what's supposed to happen there but his next touch wasn't the greatest so let me know what we do for a while that's what you want to avoid is leaving your teammates in those those spots when you know they're going to be needing some help they both went actually almost worked so that's just rank in a nutshell right there leave that there force them to throw it away and now i can grab the mid-left boost that's one of the reasons why i don't like 2v2 personally all that much because there is no passing it rewards just solo playing everything which you could not do in threes especially at the highest level it's not going to win your games yeah you don't know you don't need to know how to play as like a team player in twos which is something i don't like about it at all because i'm very team oriented so i don't like that aspect of it it's a very solo selfish gameplay it's the best way to explain it really that's why i love threes though this game mode also is very against like passing like if you pass in this game mode most of the time it gets cut out it's obvious and then it's just obviously an empty net because you only have two people on the field and threes you pass and gets cut out you created a lot of pressure sometimes if you make a good pass and follow-up save hopefully he puts to my side he did that's a good touch to make i'll play it over one make him touch that making them jump for a save like that is always good my team is a little bit closer i could put pressure on them earlier but i might have got stuck not being able to get a boost or something i'm not sure fine again just trying to get into the way this play here good play take my time there not just throw it away right then you're waiting on me to just hit that to the corner i'll take a soft touch to myself yeah good two games hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are watching
