and i hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo what's up guys gonna be playing some games today with torment who was obviously my ex-teammate teammates for four years and we have a lot of obviously past chemistry together and we've done a lot of past videos playing together so let's get into it for today should be some good games as it always is let's see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game we're playing against musty and tarantero materials from rogue and musty obviously uh we recently signed musti as a as a content creator me and gary we're trying to get him on the org and um yeah we're happy to have him obviously he's a really nice guy and we recorded some stuff in the past probably record some more in the future yeah it's gonna be uh it'd be an interesting first game he's up grinding really early turn tarot appears to have rage quit what the hell the adventures of late night ranked sorry musty you have to deal with that but yeah that would have been a good match would have been a fun match for you that was interesting let's get into the next one probably be musty again we'll see we'll see who's on all right for the first game playing in chicago and turbo so this is a pretty tough first game to start on obviously two pro players two very solid players at that and we get a nice kick off goal to start it off obviously turbo 24 lcs's very uh accomplished player chicago is just a very good solid veteran now in rlcs been around this couple seasons now so both these players are very very good very capable of popping off at any time always fun games running into him and ranked nicer torment the 1v1 i'm gonna fake this i think that was a better play a good play to make i don't want to go right away here i let [ __ ] just throw it over to my teammate not bad to bait that ball what a bump that was a good bump from torment smart play turbo likes to float for his aerials a lot like that so you kind of leave yourself um vulnerable to this kind of bump place trying to help out tour he knew so he's just waiting on it that's smart taurus still in my opinion very very good defensive player and to this day he's up there with the smartest like defensive minds in the game obviously of all time i think the way he shadows on defense is very good makes it very tough for people to get like dribble plays on him and stuff like that because he shatters very well very smart player in that in that sense let him go for me here i have time on the ball here so my kill time for torment to get back it's a good 50 to take nice good follow-up so you really see tour get beat in a ball like that he's always going to get a touch on that whereas a lot of other players might get beat there and it might actually lead to a goal because of it don't get me wrong every pro player has got to be good at defense these days but definitely some better than others does it get saved from turbo very well done turbo's just leaving now but may boost and leave cargo in a bad spot temporarily i'll just keep applying pressure here i'm not a boost but that'll go straight to torment again that's the whole point of me going there just baiting out that touch i don't need to dive in on it and waste my position and i can get toward free ball instead that's not a bad situation to be in at all hit that around cargo is smart take one touch here which i pass it over to him good high touch i got this up pretty easily over to the corner it's pretty good for us as well hit it high off back killed one that's gonna have a ton of time off that demo see what he does with it good play might even be in that's really good we take those we take those they got two minutes left and like i said two very good players there's no doubt in my mind they can come back and i think regardless we should run into them again for a second game so going one i want to get to a team like this is a pretty good day i'd say for a video so that's the goal at least win this one and we guarantee the the 101 record oh the bump was good there i'm terrible about that upward touch actually almost went straight in the smart idea i think actually no one for this oh it's just in oh okay they forfeited that was kind of a hard show i went for like a cheeky like wave dash shot to finish that off it was a good attempt though it was the right idea for sure but yeah we ran to those guys twice already i already played these guys twice before recording this video and i haven't really been recording tonight just been playing ranked so we beat them the first two times and that was the third game so we're doing pretty good against them but i think if we run into them again they're going to play better in the next one so let's get into the next step and keep it up see if we can get another win and finish out the video with the bang that was a really good bump from torment absolute banger bumpy let's get into the next game stephen keep it up let go to go all right so it's not because you're playing dino and kef now for the last game i'm surprised to stop queueing they're only gone for for a while when they play late night like this good 50 for torment so you'll see a lot of what twos is um especially like the highest level twos these days is just baiting out touches so here i'm just gonna dribble this if he hits this around me that's actually a really good flick probably a goal but oh we're trying the shot killed one there it's good gonna follow that's fine now over the tour but that's what i mean right there that was a bait for torment i don't even need to go for that ball and i'll point it out again when it happens in the future but i'm dribbling that ball back there and if they do hit it it's gonna go back to my teammate regardless that's kind of what i want so i'm gonna wait till the very last moment to make my move because that's when i'm gonna have the best chance of scoring and worst case scenario they get a touch to go straight to my teammate anyway i think i'm losing my voice a little bit because finding it hard to say some words i don't know why like it's not coming out fully it's really weird i think i'm just really tired not gonna lie i'm staying up a little bit later than i should be good job from tor yeah it's got a lot more patience it feels high level rocket league in my opinion patience is everything now that's what it feels like at least that was a good 50 from torment i had a feeling that's what he would try to do just sit there and you don't waste your position you're not flipping or anything and it just goes straight out to your teammate if your teammate's positioning the right spot it's going to be able let me go back to the booster hold on to it i'm alone for bits i'll just go he messed up his touch and i saw that i'll try to just take advantage of that wait for torment he should challenge just bait this out for me now i'm in a weird spot because his flick didn't really go straight to me so i have to play that even more patient that's where i can get back and unfortunately the whole play was just played a little bit too slow and it was hard to read there that was a good 50 i think but the only problem is i can't get a good follow-up touch and torment thought that he would come in and just shoot that straight off the bat so that was a good fake from him to take his time there but again that's just being patient and taking your time and making sure you're getting the most out of your opportunities right every single person in high level twos does this now and it makes it really hard to play against and there's a huge skill difference now i'd say even bigger than before when it comes to high level players that's a good touch to delay some time tour has time on that that's a good hit could have maybe dribbled but that's still fine okay yeah i should have been a little bit closer for the potential demo there i had a feeling that was gonna happen but it's too risky to just straight up assume because if it doesn't come through and then he gets a boom over my head probably in my net it's a good dribble looks like you left after me oh my bad my bed it works okay i thought tory's gonna leave that for me after like i thought he'd realize that it was a tap off the wall for myself i should have left that firm there but it works i just slammed him into the demo i just told him go get the last guy back not put it in and i guess it worked a little bit of a miscommunication there but we're not really talking so it happens obviously it's a good 50 torment might be able to get a slot here might be able to shoot that's a really good 50. i'm not gonna go so here i'm trying to kill time for tortilla back so whatever i can do to delay as much time as possible that's gonna be like the best situation for us i don't wanna force anything dumb here so i'm gonna go for a bump that's where we'll have free possession on the wall and now he's gonna do the same thing for me i'm going back so we're gonna kill as much time as possible i can fake this or i could just go for a demo that's fine as well i'll let for me go i'll be back with some pads here good play also let me know if you guys want a double flip recitatory i was thinking about making one i don't know how many you guys would actually want one because i know these days like a lot of these high level tv tube um they're a lot more slowed down and like it's all thinking now it's a lot more thinking than just straight up pure mechanics people are much better at defending it and they know how to stop every situation from happening pretty much so it's a lot less of just high level mechanics and it's hard for you guys to learn [ __ ] off of watching me because i don't get to do double flippies every single game people are high highest level they're like really smart at stopping it right so i can do a tutorial and tell you guys exactly how to do it if you guys want it's completely up to y'all but you gotta let me know down below and i will be checking the comments and make sure if you do enjoy the video guys do leave a like i never really asked you guys to leave likes or anything but it does let me know how much you enjoy the content so make sure you if you do like the video like if you do thoroughly enjoy watching anything do leave a like on it to let me know make it hard for myself on purpose just to get the extra practice and extra backboard read practice why not if you guys watch my streams i always do that if i have nothing and i'll go for like a double tap for no reason just to get the extra practice in to make sure i'm consistently where i want to be mechanically i can't really hit this yet but i'm just here to bait out the touch past that middle that's fine tour didn't commit so there's really no danger here hit over one try to stay on this no boost here but i might be able to do something get it mid good 50s one more got the block there we go hit play and ended up forfeiting all right guys it's gonna be it for today's video it is super late right now so i don't want to stay up for that much longer and i love you guys thank you so much for all the support on the channel you guys are the absolute best almost up to 860 000 subscribers something crazy like that so thank you so much for making that a possibility and making my dreams come true i love you guys peace you
