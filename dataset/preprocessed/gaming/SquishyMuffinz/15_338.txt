you before we get into the video guys a quick announcement it's been on pretty much every one of my last videos because we got to win this war guys we're on the road to 1 million subs are trying to be the second Rockley youtuber to 1 million subscribers this was a dream of mine since I started YouTube I mean it was something that I thought would never even be reachable but you guys have shown me that it's definitely reachable so thank you for making that even close to a possibility so if you guys aren't subscribed right now and you're watching this video go down beneath the channel press the subscribe button and press the bell so you could turn on notifications as well I love you guys enjoy the video yo wazzup guys I'm excited because we were finally in diamond so we're gonna see what the diamond gameplay looks like we didn't play any diamond players in the last video we played Platts the very last placement game you play plats but we ended up finishing diamond so we're diamond 1 I really really hope these dudes get hit some arrows because I'm trying to at least area like halfway up the map you know I mean not bang every single shot but I'm just trying to at least aerial halfway up the map and mash these dudes so let's say let's have some fun that hopefully will play some some decent diamonds let's get into it we're playing a 1k MMR player playing Neymar Neymar rocio's and we have poor loot on our team he's 99 1 mm or against 1k and 955 decent area already nice touches I'm liking this the speed just got amped up a whole new level dude made them both panic right up a net for my teammate did nicely done well done I didn't do anything crazy whatsoever drove to the ball capped it off the crossbar real quick took their boost as well so they can't get back as quick and my teammate with the nice finish into the bottom corner well done that is what I like to see for kickoff skies a huge part a 2v2 as long as you're not losing it terribly hard you're gonna be in a good position I would say try to hit the ball as centered as possible use a good amount of your boost don't use no boosts a kickoff are you gonna lose it every time but use almost all your boots hats and kick off and then hit the middle of the ball along with using almost all of your boost while you're you're flipping calming your flips properly and you're gonna be good to go you won't mess up your hair up it's pretty easy I mean Kay also a pretty easy thing to learn but they're very hard to master so I would say the the main thing though is just hitting the ball in the center and flipping into it at the exact point of contact that way you get a good 50/50 on it but that was wide empty net the guy missed on the corner I read the Miss pretty easily and then I should have a wider empty net to finish it off I'll take you off I guess you doubt for that pretty easily my go for a weak shot let's see what they do just save from Neymar bang I wonder if like Neymar actually plays Rock Lee I know you play csgo I wonder if he actually plays roughly then or if any like professional like big-name football slash soccer players everyone call it play roughly I'm pretty cool I could see some of them maybe playing it because it's like has the same appeal as soccer or a ball don't don't kill me Europeans Santosh this didn't have us up the wall let's treat him early I wrote wide empty net no she's my wave - against his speed that's something that I taught my brother who's a who's currently champ 1 / champ - I taught him this when he just started playing how to wave - and that's something that helped him a lot it helps you win like those those races back to a ball like we're trying to get back on defense no I gotta wait - like that is HUGE honestly I'd say that's something you should practice early on it's not that hard you just flip as you better touch the ground and get all your momentum from your float and I have a wave - tutorial I'm pretty sure now let's have an advanced one she goes like they left all right dude this is getting out of hand everyone's forfeiting too early I'm not even trying to do that much and therefore things so really I don't know I don't know how to play worse than I'm currently playing so I'm trying my best to make sure they stay in the lobby the whole time but whatever we got 37 points from that we went up the division 3 run 11 game win streak right now so I think with wind shakes and Rock League they do gain way more points and if you lose one it cancels out your win streak and you don't gain as much so yeah we're on a pretty big win streak right now we're at 9 9 8 mm are almost up to one case let's get into the next one seeping keep it up like it'll be good alright so we're playing all over 1k MMR please right now at 10:45 on our team 10:37 and 1004 take a kind of jump for that now go for another shot [Music] I don't know this dude you could have jumped but I think he just was trying to play the shot I was talking about earlier where you just let them hit it to you like he challenged a second one but I was just faster the ball than him he's gonna have this let my teammate go I'm gonna rotate behind him he's already going toward the ball kids he may should have this for more time I'm gonna get behind him cuz oh wait okay whoa okay okay I was my my muscle memory kicked in I was in a shoot day and I was like nope I can't do that Oh Mike stop hitting it so I'm going for the ball dude did you keep sitting is so high I don't know my brain doesn't know how not to you to go for that also how do they not just go in we're good okay dude I gotta stop I gotta stop my thought I saw but I saw all right my teammate is actually insane that's one that's two all righty again take your time when you have it like they just got baited in by me doing pretty much nothing you know at that first guy fake challenge me he didn't waste his position and he gets a free ball out of that but because he just went straight for and the second guy didn't fake challenge neither has lost back just gives me a free goal pretty much you want to at least throw in a fake challenge here there especially when your last back you be throwing one fake challenge there I'm probably gonna flick that early and the last guy back has a pretty easy ball to deal with I'll show you guys an example when they have possession but fake shout is pretty much just a way to get the ball back without having to throw your position so there I probably should've my sugar for the ball to be honest like fake challenging was good but his shot was was better than I expected from him to be honest I was gonna mess it up so I didn't get into position to save it early enough for those who get shot from him was well done that was a good spot the fake challenge and that's what I was talking about earlier hit the ball back to me for free I didn't get baited in for nothing but at the same time like I still did get scored on well what's the fury old for that dude it's crazy yeah I still didn't get scored on for the fake challenge but it was because of my positioning after the big challenge I did get to to get the ball out of his possession now at first city does see this up the back I'm not gonna shoot good a shot but I want to see my tomato so my team make an aerial pretty pretty easily like an aerial as well so we're an aerial territory which is good and there they're getting better at their their challenges in their shooting and stuff I had this off for my teammate yeah my team making aerial pretty woman up I want to take that from him on the wall because it seemed like he had abused by the way like I don't recommend you take the ball from your teammate but if you can kind of read that they're too low but she was low I could tell then obviously take it from if there's nobody around of course and you're not gonna get yourself scored on it's very situational good challenge I'm gonna go back to go here I'm gonna see him he can't get a good shot and I go back to goal is the most likely he's gonna give me a free ball here yeah I just played over one it's just so far back he's never gonna win that challenge I go for a very very slow double touch all right they left again I can't end on that you're just like way too quick of a game so I'll play one more home run game I don't see a double touches over the top I don't know let me know if you guys think that was too much because I have seen diamond players and my brother has hit double touches like that in diamond when I was watching it play as a diamond player so I don't think that's too much to be honest and I am Diamond tuna so on the end that was too much but they did leave I think they're gonna leave regardless were up 5 1 well yeah we're diamond - Dave - we're a 1033 m mr-- let's get into the last game of the video and the see if we can keep up the the win streak let's go alright for the last game we're playing against swap Supra exotic lines they both have over 1 km and more one of them is hiring me more than me actually wait the whole lobbyists hire ever more than me alrighty so we're playing all diamond twos are both getting closer closer to champ already I like you didn't have us on the wall you already tell people anyway better man so what I like to see he's gonna go again you speed from exotic lines we're gonna have us on the wall alright so we're just what I said dude that double tab wasn't too much there's a chance that diamond players can hit that I'm gonna go for something a little crazy just gonna go for some boring old aerial shot there pop it up nothing too crazy but crazy enough to work a diamond it could definitely do that I just have to practice their mechanics a little bit I'm not gonna go for too much of yourself dumb I try to stay grounded I miss that was just me missing to be honest it's that close one meeting right away your speed and Mahon try 30 booster because he might miss you could just take another shot on goal I literally tried to hit that Adam just to see what would happen like if he could save it or not I had a whole Boulder shearing about try to shoot it as if I wasn't dying shoot a bad house hard to think Kevin might be pretty good I'm trying not to be too good trying to be diamond trying to be a pretty good diamond hit Ariel actually not bad should a double jump though the only single jumped it it's wise a little slow I'm gonna go on the ground here I'm not gonna Ariel for something weird here we go take your time when the balls in an awkward spot and you can get the free reward out of it imagine getting scored on you see Kevin's face Kevin Malone legend himself I faked this so I made it away he's on target so I'm not gonna go for the beach it's not worth it I'll just bang this up the wall nothing crazy I just want to see what he does okay you miss do you making have a touch here and I'll follow his touch again I'm gonna wait if he misses good if not I can easily get back nice really challenged that one was talking about our previous video first team a challenge second guys should be a little bit closer and he was in the perfect spot for that all right didn't have us off the wall so I'll wait for his touch let's just shoot that now good turn on this hit it off the wall you can maybe go he's too far I'll kill this guy that'll be my teammate an easy way to rotate in and there we go the whole point of twos two you want to make it as easy as possible for your teammate right so if you can kill somebody on the way out and not mess up where the ball is like not make your teammate have to guess what the ball is going to be leave the ball where it's at kill somebody let him have to just win the challenge you can rotate it back middle get yourself a free goal just like that there you go flash my teammate you got certain here this guy's not bad at all he's very fast again just nice little double jumping I'm just gonna launch this one home sure they do nice to make him go try it's like the boost I didn't do anything crazy here I know that alone oh it's probably very low and boo she's gonna have to throw the ball away in a sec yeah I just got for me to fake this get possession back for free hit off the backboard should be free all for my teammate if he's close enough a little far oh good there I messed up my wave - but I could take the had path back get a kill as well I'm not sure might see me I didn't see him up there good pass maybe he wants to pass to me I'll steal that real quick good job for my teammate though yeah we're still doing anything like two above with a diamond would try to do but we're doing just enough that it's hard for them to deal with it oh yeah like I said the first was a little bit too quick let's play one more and see we can keep it up we're at ten 67mm mara diamond to dip three might even get up to diamond 3 after this next game if we can take the win here so hopefully we can let's get into it he said that's said just lost four in a row I don't know why I'm here said that's rough shame he matched me with cheffy all right into the next got ourselves in 1100 Oman plane 1100 and that one came in white player as well I'm going for the shot alright does I mean a little bit a little bit of bat touch from him I probably shouldn't have went for the aerial seeing his most diamonds probably wouldn't be up for that but it was obviously the right play to make it it's an incident if you can get that I said I'm saying guys if you practice like all the fundamentals like all of the basics just get them down to the 4 where you can do it like easily like you don't have to think about it and you can like instantly jump up for something into shoot well you can practice that you don't even need to pride it anything too crazy just being able to bang the ball fast you could literally get yourself the champ it seems by doing that I'm gonna see ya for how long that works for how long until you have to like pull out some crazy stuff cuz I still haven't done anything crazy I really I feel you can get the grand champ I literally just basics it just bang the shot whenever you have an opportunity to bang the shot if you could just bang it see you at the grand champ simple flick there force the bad touch same thing still applies in this right man throw the ball on that if they panic if they get a bad touch just clean up the the free shot after you nice nice like Ariel off the wall - a little dribble there try confusing me put off the back I mean want to shoot that see my teammate can shoot I go back here I wanna see how they vegetable this yeah I used too much beauty there to DES I'm gonna wait in the same spot can I go on the wall here he looked at a wall like these any boost say let's just see how they react to the the balls being thrown our goal here take this boost cut a shutter beat him to this it's fine I don't want to use too much but you still as well are you trying to go for a double actually I like that idea a lot like I said he's just slightly lacking the consistency and it's aerial control to be able to do that I'm sure you has it double touches but it's not gonna be as consistent as obviously a high ranked player right should be empty net for my teammate nice yeah still just way too many defensive mistakes I'm seeing out of people that appear to be in diamond 3 I think it is I think 1139 is probably a diamond 3 play so way too many defensive mistakes still i guessing 1200 is champ 1 yeah these players just worked on their their defense said it'd be a lot better instantly how's the back you offer I mean he went slow mine was a very fast one trying to beat heard around him anyone slow but it could reach for him good goal should be going for the kickoff for the ever you should just flipped once and flip into the center of the ball like I said in the previous video I think it was a nice challenge dad you're gonna have that I don't get for stealing shots ooh did you go no no no no it was such a weak shot that I was like there's no problem I hit under him and he had no boost he fell on it dude oh no I was gonna say then have to really pay too much taxes like weak I was really literally about to say that and then the main lands on my touch that supposed to be under him I feel embarrassed I feel disgusted I feel all kinds of embarrassment I'm not gonna shoot that just take this back I was gonna shot from jajan over by the way nothing to take away from him it was a good good little ceiling shot can't go back alright I'll train on this one I'm not gonna go off the wall go on the ground because that's all I'm capable of being and I'm it out here it's gonna be hard to pre flip that for me someone who's not sure fully how the mechanics work yet of the game I'm gonna fake this makes me I'm gonna go and then go for the boost it's a guy oh my gosh everfree cool I was gonna play to make there to think that I'm in a panic toward that ball makes one get baited in trying to dunk me and then I can grab the boost secure the boost and bait the last guy and he's gonna think I'm awkward and not expecting him she dropped down I'm still either for my teammate it's me better for him so I'm gonna miss that I actually have touched it off back my team it wasn't close yet heard him really far back still hit it around him I'll take the Boosh fake that trying to get spicy with the fakes I'll fight us up the the right one I look for my teammate I try to pass them let's see where he is can you shoot that you try and go back here let's see if you can have a shot here just play the patient got two touches we're being up the net but still have the beach for it here this once let's see what they do here we go again the simple with his tap middle teammate ready for it the good thing is though in these ranks your team I can actually Arial to those balls hit that there let's see what jazz I should just bang this to me I think actually dribbling his ball is actually good play I like that a lot not a judge but they both went just a nice play that's not on jabs they're like that was a good good play to slow that down I like that but sleep went up for the bump on me I think yeah a good play made bad because his teammate kind of messed him up well it's good to slow down a ball like that instead of just throwing it away only reason why I thought he'd throw other ways because we are playing in diamond right now and I figured people wouldn't really slow the ball down that much but that's something that I was really trying to push my brother to do as well when you have time on the ball slow it down but not always sometimes it's better here someone's waiting for the dribble just bang it over there so it's all a situational in it's really it's really down to just learning the fundamentals of the game and being able to actually put those into your game whenever you see the opportunity to actually applying those fundamentals but yeah we got ourselves 36 MMR to that we're now diamond through division 1 so we're gonna close the chin not too bad at all hope you guys enjoyed this video we are blasting through these ranks
