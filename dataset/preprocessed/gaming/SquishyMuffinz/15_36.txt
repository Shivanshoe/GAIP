yo what's up guys so the competitive season ends in four days and we'll be playing some twos today trying to get into the top like 50-ish range before the end of the season so hopefully we can win some games get some dubs let's see how it goes [Music] all right we got extra against indigo and turd actually we're gonna have everyone in here it's gonna be sweaty a really quick q2 everyone's around the same rank for sure should try to take a quick shot i'm gonna come here for the boost i'm gonna try to make him hit the ball away and get the bump it's pretty big he made some 1v1 threw it away but it's not a bad idea to try to throw a shot like that early on in the game pass the try demo on the other guy would have been massive actually it's still okay though you miss letting me go for him it's fine probably there's a double here so i'm just gonna wait better display patient if he goes again it's actually fine for my teammate good job to be there that's a lot of distressing in too much positioning obviously low ranks you might not have a teammate in that position so you might have to try to make a play on that but at the same time the opponent's not to make as good of a touch and lower rank so you won't have to worry about it kind of goes hand in hand let's take the boost here i don't mind if he's touching this as well it's not going to be anything crazy my team gets a free ball so i would definitely play for the booster 10 or 10 times i think it's more worth it soft touch to myself i don't bait them in and then played over him try close better just play the safe shot instead of going for something perfect and potentially missing and getting a scored on going for a shot that's actually going to be on target it's more important there i think one big hit try to go for another touch my teammate goes he has to get hit here it's good that he backed off one of the situations where if you're going you literally have to play it perfectly or else you need your team scored on so it's good that you decided to take a little bit of a safer approach so i can play this calmly it's a really good 50 it's going to force some pressure on him let's get a control touch here my teammate can probably take a challenge on this that's fine i'll be careful though he's gonna have a big hit thought touch to myself maybe almost a good uh dunk but i think i had the ball locked the whole way there which is good played around both to get play there put over one play middle now my teammate he just boom that away that's fine he doesn't really have a play there he can't really shoot off of that teammate should go for me here his goal is to force his high good job did his job well so all he needs to do there i go for a bump here nice perfect play the second guy essentially becomes useless at that point because i push this guy all the way back to his neck i push him to a spot where his challenge is gonna be so close to the goal line that his teammate literally cannot follow it up so as long as my bumper does come through it's going to be a go every single time it's really well played perfect time to use neutral but we actually have two goals out of that as well well i played the first uh half of this game pretty perfectly i'd say with our teammate in terms of what we're challenging very smart in general so you have to do at the high level you have to make sure you're challenging things the right way and you got to make sure that you're taking your chances when it's worth to take those chances and not over extend for stuff that's not worth it i'm not going to go for this yet wait for the bounce put it forward should i take the bishop of me if not i can at least bump him and like be a little bit annoying i might have helped him a bit there actually teammates should go yeah unfortunate thing is i try to like bump him to get in the way to be somebody useful i actually bumped him closer to his head his head was actually not great for him but because i bumped him like that i bumped him more toward it gave him the opportunity to actually follow it up i think they should instago here i'll be behind him in time it's fine it's a very aggressive challenge for him but if he waits a second an extra second there it probably gets scored on to or played for him to recognize that i'm not going to go for this quick rather let him panic throw it away i could turn on this throw into a weird spot yes i get a big hit here or no hit at all so it's going to be good for me to wait for the miss and either way big it's not going to be anything dangerous hit over one it's fine free hit for my teammate so many other situations i'm giving my teammate where it's like literally just a free ball nothing to worry about that's how you know you're doing a good job at like baiting the ball so right here same situation teammate as a free ball again because i just kind of drove up enforcement to a weird spot it's a good play to make it's kind of just hitting it away a little bit too much though when he does like those hits right there aren't great if you can get more of a controlled first touch would have been perfect but it's also much easier said than done in those situations but as i say that his first touch here is really good more controlled hits around one and he gets an extra second touch which is really good and then good positioning from us to get around the ball and get 50. that's a perfect example what i was talking about if when i do give him those three balls it takes an extra second to actually control it and get a good touch on it it's gonna be better off for him i have to turn on that quick i don't have time to get boost same situation here it's gonna go quick be the first man in that play play my challenge properly it'd be much better for my teammate he should go for me here just four some high doesn't matter if he gets past him force touch here i'll take one shot and see if he goes in why not get him up on the mid guy be pretty big i can't actually reach him tommy should have take the boost fake here it's fine that's why i love faking that because i still have my position i can literally still get around to the ball i keep all my boosts they panic they throw it away to my teammate most of the time it's always a better situation to fake and like instead of just panic and throw it away to them it's always better that's actually a really good touch for me probably gonna be a goal i couldn't reach it a little bit too far so at least my challenge is enough to force them wide just good nice worked again perfect time to use that game though really solid stuff i think we played that very very well in general we didn't really make any big mistakes inside of that one challenge at the end there could have probably gotten a scored on but still a good game regardless let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs see how it goes all right we got propser and aegis here after a very long queue and we reveal in our squadron unfortunately his teammate is afk i feel like we should give them a goal i don't know if my teammate will want to let's see is he back hold on i want your dad bod esport sure man all right we're giving the goal back only right thing to do for your touch i would want them to do that for for me that's why i think it's only fair go back i'd have faith in the community to do stuff like that so i think it's should be expected of people i'm like afk all tabbed queuing for a game and the notification that i found the game doesn't even pop up so i think it's better to do that because that can happen to anybody it's a little bit unfortunate when it does put over one there's actually on the wall here we have a free air drill which i put around one more close gotta bump them actually really good bump should be a goal i sit down playing really well today it's a really good dunk and i could bump on the fall up there a little squishy save bump i haven't done that in a long time i bumped like that that was a really good first touch it was actually crazy something i used to practice like way back like 2015 2016. whenever like we've actually became it was like early 2016 where dash became a thing i used to practice that little reverse wave dash the first touch i've actually used it ever really in pro games but i think it's very useful i've never seen anyone try to do it to be useful it's a good bump to go for only thing is i went a little bit too far forward but it's still good so force this play out actually very awkward then i could play the low shot here it's gonna be very hard he has to block one straight line very quickly like that oh it's gonna be difficult really to touch my teammate made it super awkward even on a good player like these guys so good job from them i play this to myself hit around one i think actually really good read i thought he missed but more red from him drop my teammate good leave as well actually like that a lot presence of mine to realize that i'd be there playing around one i can go again here if i double to myself off the wall should be a goal i'll sit down one of the hardest things in the game to stop when you're just flat-footed on the ground like that and you think a shot's coming in but it goes off the wall very very difficult it's always gonna be better for the guy coming in because the ball is coming toward them rather than the guys in that having to go to a ball that's going away from them drop my team in my bed on the bump there hopefully you can bait this out for me just make them flick or anything it doesn't really matter make him that's good actually he kind of made him jump now he's going to have to use the slip as soon as the flip's used here he has no play it's okay he said sorry because he cut me off a bit there but it's not a big deal at all either you gotta go out of it no big deal essentially when someone's in the air the way you think about it as soon as they've used their flip their threat is like down by a lot like as soon as their flip is gone like their threat in the air is pretty much gone most of the time at a high level that's unfortunate but my team had the 50 so i tried to move to the right to read where to go but i shouldn't have done that what happened here oh he tried to wave that she jumped and brought him to the right so he would have actually had the block on it would have been fine but slight air we have someone's in the air and someone looks scary just try to look at do they have their flip if not all they can really do is play it very linear or like wait for you to come and try to tap it over you with one extra bit of boost and you can normally notice it so here he has a flip now he used it he has no more threats pretty much the way i'm thinking about it in those situations so it doesn't really matter who you're playing again doesn't matter how good they are if you pay attention to when they've used their flip or if they have a flip or if they're going for flip reset just the way their car looks in general going toward the wall pay attention to all those things you can actually decipher what they're going to do and how threatening the rest of the play will be and if it's even something scary that you have to panic and have to go for most of the time it's not most time you can play really patient but anyway hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe but i see that's all in the next one logo peace [Music] you
