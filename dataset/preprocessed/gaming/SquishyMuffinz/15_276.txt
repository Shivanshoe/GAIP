menteur gonna fake them see that's the most like like slick way I've ever killed the ball zero seconds I saw the double fake just to let it like plop off your car oh my god all right play one more game torches you can't have games and started to bot I've been playing the tour for a little bit recorded stuff set play one more game at or not to be it for today yeah let's get the next one see you I guess all right philosophy we got a tough opinions Adam and Angel socio that's good finish off the video can we end on a dub is it doable shall I control this well something I could bump up imperfect but at this point I just gotta kill time for so to get back my or quick how it works I guess maybe he'll do it'll do a little risky I should have waited probably but I don't want to wait there in that a double on me it's probably gonna score that high wait I think I don't know couldn't do a lot of different things there I think I did the wrong thing though I'm fully honest myself could've got us scored on gonna wait for Torian no wait might miss a still a my shot and there we go I've all the advantage there so I can take my time on my flip that's probably gonna be a girl most at a time as long as I make sure the first game I miss is I put in an awkward spot for that reason exactly gonna give to them but it's fine you just clear back that's where I've maybe you can fall get buff him over one I'm gonna fake this for the bump patience for him I'm gonna let him in again maybe I'll even see the guy on the ground it's fine want to give it the tour yes go for this pic not gonna be him but I can try to get there boost just trying to get a good shot for Tori let's try they're both awkward and low B so I could just share again three ball for Tori again it's kind of like my role and I play my team as well and threes I try to give as many free balls as possible to my team create as much pressure as possible and make the balls as weird as possible to hit for my opponent that's what I always do threes as well kind of try to have that same consistent place fell in twos it's pretty useful for getting goals sometimes I do leave my team too long like last back and twos I feel like my teammate that's only downside to it but I trust them to make the right play I give them a lot of space with the ball but I might not be back for like an extra two seconds because of it - vitória should await gonna be really tough for me to get shot of this so no reason to panic really very few players can get that shot consistently so don't expect the worst you know realize that not everyone's gonna be perfect and hit every single shot it's a good good thing to try to remember you know don't don't like stress yourself out thinking Emma's gonna hit every single shot every shot top corner every shot perfectly every double every read you know remember that everyone misses everyone's human and you'll be more ready for the times where you need to be ready for the misses stay right separate order who wants to use me I like the play there I got time for him it's fun trying to hit it away from that guy should be a gift or to me I wish I jumped a second earlier I could have been a go just a bad pre jump for me so so much pressure though even though they have four shots I feel like I've really had a lot of pressure a lot of opportunities gonna fake them it's gonna be really tough to say if he has all all the advantage up top there yeah I ain't just misses but it's honestly better than hitting the ball there they probably save it if he hits it the classic just how rockabilly works sometimes the misses are better than actually getting the ball trying to fake them almost work to be fine they can't reach I get the boost and go up as well so should be alright see I can do this the double reset I'm still going the pass oh my god that was a weirdest-looking pass ever how do you know that I was doing for the double I should have just tried to shoot but he probably saves that it's gonna be too slow just shot I think then we have much time if they have to kind of force a play here which we could use to our advantage as well just take an extra slow because of that like you trying to bump me just to create something under boosts we're good the fake ye-qing absolutely nothing I swear that's the plain Rockley dude do you absolutely nothing everyone's just gonna overthink everything all right Gigi's all around a lot of fun games with tor hope you guys enjoyed today's video have yourself wonderful day or night but if it's habit is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and I'll see you guys all in the next one I love y'all peace
