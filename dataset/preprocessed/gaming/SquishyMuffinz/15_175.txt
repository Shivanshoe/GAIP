yo what's up guys for today going to be solo queueing some 2v2 games but we're going to be using the brand new car from the rocket pass it's called remix i believe and it actually looks pretty clean not gonna lie it's up there this is the remix you can see this the one you get from the last tier of the rocket pass so i'm gonna give it a try for today apparently it's a hybrid hitbox it's not the dominance hitbox i thought it would be the dominant box but it's hybrid so we'll see how i like it i normally don't like hybrid hitbox cars as much but i've used a little bit in free play it's actually my first ever game with this car i can show you guys real quick again just to show you that i haven't played any games of this car at all so this is my first ever game with this car so we'll see how i feel on it all legitimate reactions everything that you'll see in this video is all obviously first time using it so i'm not making anything up i'm not trying to just say it for the video i'll generally tell you how to feel about the car and honestly out of just like free play alone it feels pretty nice but i would i would say that this feels more like a dominus than does a hybrid hitbox but then again breakout and dominance don't feel all that different to me anyway so let's get into the game for today hopefully we can get some dubs and uh hopefully we're gonna get a good idea of how this car feels to use all right for the first game we got ourselves too fast against hockey and astra this is a sweaty game pretty like regular late night q to get i'd say a lot of the same players you always run into late night queuing at 5 00 a.m right now so actually 6 a.m never mind so this is a super late night q right now it's gonna be sweaty these are the the true gamers that are up this time yeah i recognize everybody in this lobby they're all very high rank we're trying to get up the top 50 in 2v2 as well we're top 50 in uh ones and in threes and threes are actually second right now actually second place in threes and i think we're like 50th or something like that or 40th and ones i've really been playing ones a whole lot that would play more threes lately but this car feels nice in terms of the shooting the one thing i noticed even in free play i'll hit this off the wall for my teammate you follow it up don't need to go for anything myself there it's better to play that for a teammate i'd say i know he's a cross i'll just play it across that fitted and tornado should be fine he's gonna be there for it unless he misses unless that exact situation happened i played the ball across so i'm hoping that he'd you know be able to receive a pass i got blocked but worst case scenario he gets back dribbles to the corner right but there's a worse worst case scenario where even for a higher level player you know they can miss they can miss the ball and things can go extremely wrong so it happens can't be upset about it it's whatever move on i did not think there was any way that could happen obviously that's why i sounded a little bit surprised that i'm trying to fake the touch to the corner and go for a play going forward here really good bumps creates a lot of opportunity for the shot and there we go i faked the corner touch then i got a good hit forward and was able to bump both set my teammate up for a free goal we got it back just like that i'm going to fake the big touch again let him hit that it's fine i'll rotate back post now into a good position that i can react to it's fun i'm gonna fake this don't want to commit with my teammate there ah as he bumps me a little bit unfortunate funny timing though don't wanna come with my teammate and then i think he's going back and he ends up bumping me a little bit unlucky good challenge from us good patience my time a challenge well as well go for the mid boost here car actually feels really nice in terms of turning it's a good shot yeah the shooting on it and the turning on the car feels super nice to me my opinion i think both of those things feel really good i don't exactly love the shape of it but i think the way the car feels from reading it should not feel i think it's really nice but looking at it from behind like what you see when you're on ball cam and car cam etc not the greatest looking car i'd say dominance definitely better looking well it's my boost here or for the roll up here and i can just react whatever happens you shouldn't have too much on this the only downside there is that he was trying to bump me that was the only thing that made that really awkward my teammate's not not wrong to be in that corner and expect me to get that across because i should be getting it across but i also have to worry about that guy above me on the wall and i kind of expected too much of them so yeah two little bit unfortunate goals to give up this game but it's okay it happens i should have played that better regardless of there being a player that could have bumped me i should have realized that i had him beat regardless in that situation decent touch my teammate might actually pay off to be a goal potentially all right this is not the best game to judge my car off of to judge this car off of because what is happening what is happening right now there's just so much weird stuff happening one goal just rolled in he just made up on gold that one another one the guy just missed the bump i i panicked and passed him the ball tried to play it rather than a 50 not a bad idea i played this back down on my teammate here position you can fall pretty easily should beat that guy every single time not to lead him into a 1v1 just gotta watch the next touch here it's the dangerous one as long as it's put a corner i don't mind it can't really make too much out of it so it's got to be a perfect place for them to get anything out of that situation so to control myself threw them wet that's huge my teammates in a far back position there he gets a free clear and it's probably a goal for us but because he wasn't he ended up getting beat by i still trusted him to get the win that's why i went to that corner because if i if i'm in the corner and he gets the win there it's 199 a free goal but he wasn't in a very passive position he wasn't positioned for that situation whereas i still kind of again trusted my teammate to do the absolute best case scenario thing and uh it didn't pan out that way that's on me as well there she didn't fall so pretty easily good 50. that's the advantage of staying a little bit further back in that situation i can actually get it touching that 15 it's not going to be over my head so it's a good pick to make that i just did right there teammate should be back for that nice take his time here hopefully i'll say full boost middle he wants to use me play it around him i don't need to go for a shot there's no point now i can go for a shot kind of opened up an opportunity even if he saves it it's fine teammates should go for me this should be a challenge that at least creates pressure on them doesn't need to do anything too crazy but definitely a really good challenge i don't want to go for a direct shot off that again because in that situation if i do go for a direct shot normally they get full control of the ball and it's extra dangerous because my teammate might be super pushed up for it right better to hit into a quarter i think sometimes where a teammate can follow it up a little bit awkward but i go for the 50. my teammate go next nice wait for him to go again here stay middle for the free shot good try you should have that pretty easily i'll go off the ceiling for the freestyle surely i wanted the freestyle play close though again the next one's even keep it up get the back to back and win hopefully and let's see if we can learn a little bit more about the car and how it feels all right for the last game better we got ourselves candy against bml and savvy all right we'll see how this goes extra extra late night q here took a while to find this one so don't know what to expect but we're hoping for the best hopefully my teammate doesn't get beat super hard on that we're good we're chilling we got beat hard on that ball would have been obviously pretty bad for us him being lost back there oh i got stuck on the goal post it's fine though let's see behind our teammate in a good spot we need to go for the back boost it's more about just being in a good position i think i'll put an x ball which we were didn't need to bang that away but it's fine there's a little bit of danger put some pressure on them here by me just sitting here i sit in front of him again force the ball out now it's my time to go back let's get my ball to go for i could just try that's fine as soon as i saw that you have to read i just didn't want to waste any more boost once again that ball from him is not willing to go anywhere too dangerous have to be up for the block in case but played around them should be a goal i bumped the other guy really far out there we go a little bit messy a little bit sloppy but can't be perfect especially not at 6am but it was a really good dribble actually created a lot of pressure all my team had to do was just slaughter empty net obviously but easier said than done sometimes empty nets can be some of the deadliest of uh things to score for some reason in this game stay back while here in a good position to save pretty much anything not to worry about too much here chances are that going perfectly are so low not something that you should really even try to cover to be honest i think it's more important to cover the close the near post shot from that far post very low percentage shot that's not really going to go in most of the time there we go good back post rotation puts in a good position to actually get ourselves a shot of that instead of being just directly in goal if we rotate it badly there we're not going to have obviously a free goal like that so it all comes with where you rotate around the field when you're off the ball it's a very important thing to learn early on he has no boost to do anything with this teammate should just play patient should be fun nice now i'm gonna stay right here he's gonna have very limited options of what he can do all i can do is pass middle teammates got that covered so plays dead good positioning on our part take advantage of his miss touch she's able to read it you could tell pretty quickly when a situation like that's going badly for somebody if they have to stretch forward if they have to pre-flip to get there you know that touch is not going to be that good the shot of position in a spot where you can react to whatever may come your way right let's go for the goal rather than the boost there we go good conversion on that i'm happy they're not forfeiting though they have a lot of time there's a lot of chance to come back here it's far from over this car is feeling nicer nicer as i play more and more with it to be honest has the kind of vibe to it that i feel like you could just get used to i don't know the way it moves around the way you turn with it it feels so fast so smooth i'm actually very happy these guys aren't forfeiting because i do want to test this car for as long as i can i want them to be at least at least somewhat full games decent touch back but i can't be hard committed to that obviously because my teammate is pre-jumping that for a while wait back post here in a pretty good position to deal with this again like he has to shoot this perfectly for it to really lead to anything i can just control it out of the defense say middle here if he wants to use me probably won't end up passing this which is fine i'll just back off as soon as i notice that he's not really looking to pass this this might be a pass though so i should wait take the corner boost from him because he's gonna want that take the mid boost as well teammate got that so he has no way forward here put a challenge just gotta make him do something make him jump early should have somewhat of an easier ball to go for as long as he does challenge probably gonna try to cut this off he didn't okay i'll just pass this downfield a teammate if he wants to try to shoot it i'm not gonna go for this one easy either because it's there i find it fake them i have time to shoot place the low shot see if they forfeited they did okay so in a situation i can obviously go quick to that but i might as well wait if he misses that it's an empty net for me to ease your goal the other one is scoreable but i have to jump immediately and beat him to it which in most situations if he's right next to the ball you're probably still beaming to it even if you're a very fast player and you're very good at eating the ball yeah when someone's close to the ball like that then you are just give them a chance to go for the ball if they miss the free goal if they hit it then just wait for the touch play off of it it's not that hard you still have full possession of the ball you still have full pressure there's nothing wrong with doing that especially if you're not 100 sure you can get to go out of it but yeah the car my thoughts overall feels pretty nice not gonna lie it does feel good uh i do like the vibes in terms of it being a longer car rather than just the same old octane hitbox obviously i normally don't like longer cars as much but this is one of the few hybrid slash long car hitboxes that i actually really do like not gonna lie the way it turns the turning radius was a lot tighter than most of the other cars it was really quick feels snappy i like that about this car a lot i guarantee you if you look at the statistics this car has to have one of the best turning radiuses it just feels that way to me maybe it's a full-on placebo but it just feels like it turns really fast um but outside of that i really like how it feels um like in the air as well like air rolling and stuff like that feels really nice the look of it i'm not like 10 out of 10 on it i'd say it's like 8 out of 10. uh but you know give it a try if you guys do have the rocket pass it's one of the first things in the rocket fast i believe this is obviously the last one that i'm using the very final tier but let me just look at where it is tier one is the very first one so it actually looks pretty clean in tier one as well so give it a try if you guys have the rocket pass i'm sure a lot of you guys probably do have tier one already so yeah give it a try yourself appreciate y'all thank you guys for watching as always make sure to like the video if you enjoyed it comment down below your thoughts on the video and subscribe if you haven't already i love you guys morning you know see you guys on the next one peace
