I want to say desperate with this players right now he's going for stuff that's pretty low percentage it's not gonna work very often and there's a big risk to it just fake hopefully messes it up and I could just hit this it aside hit the Boosh let him hit it it's fine hit the this was gonna be a low put the dunk try turning middle just down this with no boost he wants me to back off I'm not going to I'm just gonna cut it be aggro here I do have the lead so I have a goal that I can give up I don't want to give up much else beyond that but it's okay to give up a goal be a little risk you may be getting a goal just to give up one I'm gonna take the corner might leave the ball nice to just go for the mid you that contain should be low and I should have a free goal if I don't mess this up let's say he's gonna be low boost so so let's get the perfect catch and he can't I'm gonna just fake this go down good save so he was gonna defense though he's playing patient enough to get back any situations where I am boo starving him I'm shy the latest fight if I can get some boost got a good challenge on him I pick off the wall so doesn't kill me I'm gonna wait this is really awkward knock I should wait earlier for sure there that's okay God then we gotta get kill I have time to go for mid boost fighting you go for this quick yeah try and shut as hard again getting his booster just makes him back off it's not gonna stay on this with load boosts you can't do much with it and if he does gets killed cuz I coulda Sketch up to 38 seconds left I'll let him come to me here I know he has to be a girl so I win the game it around them it's fun so I just hit aside gotta kill him double maybe there we go good play you can't really do anything this game played it out very smart in the times where you did decide the challenges and yeah I'll play it all around GG Nate let's get the next one and hopefully it's a quick Q like that one was it's a really really solid matchup we played it out super well and that was a really fun one game so let's get to her next even keep it up let it gonna go alright for last game running into I feel clutch I left T I think I played this got a long time ago and when we want so he's gotta be solid B still playing is it season 3 grand champ tag from way back it was gonna be good I think at least I'm gonna fake this gotta play that smart the last game patient on defense challenger we need to it was a good bump get us out of danger there I'm gonna fake challenge make him panic a little bit - 2d does but that's super passive actually on the wall nice fake challenging that yeah I should this challenge I should be more aggressive in a spot like that especially cuz I don't know he plays yet seem to try to be super passive with the ball so I'm gonna be super aggro try to counter that I don't want to out pass him that's what he wants me to do he wants me to play passive like like he's doing but that's the worst way to play against passive players just let them take time on the ball you gotta you gotta make them feel uncomfortable didn't make it awkward for him it's fine see look look how much time he like stick with the ball here I gotta be in his face so I'll try to Terran instantly try to be annoying going for my boo she's gonna full take his back here again just in such allenge so now he's going to think I'm gonna challenge every time - it's like it's like a big mind game in ones I feel like when you're challenging super I go and then you just stop challenging super agro everyone just like gets really confused try to play it awkward for him but you still got to it put it out well it's fine you could tell you pose a lot of one that's just from the way you place I guess playstyle is very very won't be one based it's very slow try to does it get goes off mistakes type play stuff might miss this I could read off of it my pop is up hi hopefully I know I can beat them in there I spot like that that's something that playing a lot of threes does help you with just speed in the air and knowing when you can be your opponent too and once it's not something you want to do a lot unless you're super confident you're building the air so I don't really see him doing that much you'll see him just dribble alot try to keep it as grounded as possible just have ones players play in general I tend to go from where your base stuff because I know I can I know that's something that I kind of have an advantage on over most well-known players so I like to do that I've always played that placed on ones surprising place that's so passive there you could just shoot quick not the best shot but it's fun can't really get back happens could've scored that but then again you just played well played a slow on defense got a good counter out of it that's this place that like I said he's gonna play as passive as possible to try to play off counter it's actually he's not gonna try to force an issue for some mistake I'm gonna try to do it the how my shot I make him uncomfortable go for demos like that get free goals our own way I forced it to happen so you have to play against players that have playing passive got to make your opportunities happen then you go from the abuse I got corn here take the first touch go for shot quick there you go I've always done those little gerbils as little tiny bounce Tribble touches super-effective still are super effective onca should have held on to my boots there I think living the better play now I'm in an awkward spot I'm gonna use no boost that way I still have a little bit left in the tank try to deal with this for to see me just super awkward cuz I got bumped to Mars unfortunate getting bumped that far when he was just driving in the world that's good I'd jump to that exact moment see it does try let's go quick it's probably pretty noted on playing but I have to like this cuz it's just that should have counter - what are you doing I feel like it's the most boring well view one game when two people are just waiting for the other person to make a mistake so yeah you could tell that's what my playstyle is that I'm kind of just trying to bait him in make things super awkward for him at all times throughout this game I don't want to take the dribbles too slow because if they are taken - so we're just gonna wait to tell you all the ways his goal then he's gonna challenge that he didn't have a counter at sex so I'm trying to just make it as awkward as possible for him that's having a bump um it's fine it's kind of a waste cuz I couldn't get the bump but if I could play this high it's good get free go again just playing it around him also thank you guys for all the support on the the 6 mins videos you guys have really been loving them seem so thank you guys for that I'm glad you have been liking it's been fun recording there we go what kind of motor number at this game 53 seconds we can get one or two more probably end up forfeit in still come back up oh for sure on his end he has to play it out really smart good work though he adapted really well to how he is playing you run it to these kind of players a lot and once with this passive playstyle it's really smart it's a really good place thought to have one thing is it is very easily countered I feel by anyone who's playing just super aggro like me that's how I like to play ones just super aggressive try to make things really awkward almost got the bump can I save this there's so much net to shoot on you yeah take it as slow as possible soon you go every time I was in a really awkward spot but you get a shot that right away I had to be weary that's the right word weary weary you know she does save can we get the tent I believe no I miss I only bump mitad wouldn't even imagine all right GG's for today I hope you guys enjoyed the 1v1 games you guys want to see more 1v1 games or more 6 minutes whatever it may be the middle down below I always check the comments even though I might not respond to all of them I always do check the comments after every single videos uploaded so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video have yourself a wonderful day or night better 10 minutes when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and I'll see you guys all in the next one finished off at 14 10mm are so that's well into top 40 I think weird like 39 or something right now I want a shake but we're around there for sure but yeah hope you guys enjoyed have a good night love y'all see you the next you
