yo what's up guys going to be running some mobile games for today let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first time we got ourselves against vola this was an instant queue so he's really high rate as well not sure who this is if someone their name changed they're doing the the wave dashing off though so definitely good at once it's one like really quick telltale sign i know someone's going to be uh solid at once when they have some uh solid kickoff like that i always expect them to be good said hi i'll say hi there after this i'm gonna double jump here try to take one touch over them head to the side try to control this fake first touch just in case he committed there i wanted to go for that this is a bad thing to challenge though as soon as i jumped on that i knew it was bad the challenge that was well played from him though that's really well played from him the low 50 there is very smart because worst case scenario you see how his car larry just stuck to the ball right and launched my car up it's actually a good challenge for me in terms of like how i went at the ball but he played it so well to the point where it didn't matter and he was safe no matter how that situation ended up for him yeah that was a good play i don't think he expected me to go for a shot there good pop from him i try to defend for a second here i'm in a fake challenge if i make him pop i was really well played honestly okay so that's the thing that's where once becomes kind of a mind game type thing right because right here i could have definitely won this challenge had it right away if i didn't fake challenge 100 i win the challenge but he read my fake challenge and he called my bluff ended up not flicking it and he got the goal because of it but had i went right away there 100 it's gonna be a goal for me so it could definitely hold his nerve in that situation well played from him though back there sure don't miss another empty net oh my god it's my my kryptonite you guys know this these empty nets man something about them i swear they shrink the posts man like the distance between the posts they shrink it right as i shoot if i kill him here take our time try to swing on this get it off back wall play under him now as well played so we have a lot of options there by swinging out wide it gives us a ton of options we can fake that a bunch of times we can start dribbling it we can go for a shot we can have the back wall so many options you have to try to cover all of them right very tough situation for him to be in see a block same situation here so i'm going to touch forward swing to the side look at all these options i have now hit off the water myself played around them looks so simple but it's something that's so effective and very tough for him to stop or read there's no idea where that ball is going i have full control the whole time very tough thing to get out of for sure he played it well his timing on the challenge was good just a very very hard situation to get out of should i take my time here should be able to beat him to this off my back wall get the boost as well try to get all the boost if i can down the field gonna have zero here play to his corner boost again try to go to the ceiling it's a good challenge from him if i win this boost though or should be good he's gonna go for my corner i think we go good turn capitalize on that but it was well played before that because he forced me to really bad situations because we took all of his boosts he had nothing no way to get out he had to force panic to clear it's all played i'll push this early let's try something weird here instead of giving him space see what happens if we just suffocate him a little bit take his boost now i'm gonna fake challenge a bunch of times here hopefully he just shows it away we go i noticed after my first fake challenge he's been pretty consistently getting the goal by flicking me so i didn't want to give him one like that again i'm gonna fake here take my touch to the side again try to create some space for myself fake challenge fake again here fake one more time didn't panic which is smart but there's no way out i kind of wanted to see him just fly across my screen a little bit disrespectful i did have the empty net there but definitely if this is like a super important match like a tournament match up or something i definitely just slammed that in but for the content you know you gotta go for the content play to the side thought i have vision of him the whole time here and go for the shot as soon as i see him turn that's why it's so powerful because you have full view of when they're gonna go for the ball try to go for a shot here maybe a little bit awkward kind of rushed my take off a bit i didn't need to he was further than i thought it's gonna be very hard for him to score this so i just wait let him fall into my net i'm gonna be in a situation where i have the advantage again play to the corner here the ceiling to his boost again there's boost again there we go that was about as well played as i could have uh done there i just played it across over and over again this corner boost like three times you have to go over and over again try to challenge me this guy seems really nice though it was a fun game he didn't play bad by any means we're playing it out pretty smart and even though we put him in very awkward situations he was honestly doing the best thing he could have done in any situation so well played from him not bad at all can't be disappointed at that performance again the next one though all right last thing i'm playing against brisky when it was a one's me there's a lot of one so gonna be a sweaty one for sure see if we can do that he likes the insta challenge i think every single ball can i remember i think i played him not too long ago and he kind of just goes he doesn't like respect you like most players do kind of just goes for every single ball so we can use that to our advantage live unfortunate start there unlucky when those like fifty fifties or like those challenges go straight into your net you gotta just chalk it up to happens and move on you get a bump though best way to take advantage of someone being passive in a situation just trying to play the counter attack and their dribble bump there there's obviously just trying to play the the 50 50 on the goal line that goes to the corner i landed in his net he's obviously just trying to play for that so far he's at a 50 50 training tomorrow night at a capital so even though we're down right now it doesn't feel like we're losing so we should be fine situation we want to try to take advantage of the potential counter there we go i know he had no shot on goal so i just went back well patiently it's a good position to get a counter on potentially get a goal i might read my fake here all right he's going to read my next one there so i got to be careful on the next let this bounce once fine with me save my boost here he's going to play it back and get some pads i think it's wide should be fun but again and very interesting very like dangerous plays dangerous aggression but it works it works right i don't think he's complaining it's very different it's a very different way to play once playing this way though you're kind of hoping that everything every 50 50 every challenge is gonna work out perfectly for you which isn't always a consistent thing to rely on there's definitely some games where everything might go your way but in terms of like having to win a series against somebody uh this might be an inconsistent play style to hope to do that with but that's what it seems like in my opinion because there's like some 3v3 playstyles that are like that as well that some teams have kind of reminds me of that a little bit where things have to go your way perfectly for you to be able to win consistently right you don't really want to rely on that it's a very fast very very fast pinch you want to try to play in a way that it's consistent and you can replicate it all the time and you don't have to rely on things to go your way but out of your control right you want to have control of the outcome of the games i don't know if i'd feel in control of the outcomes playing the way he's playing right now he's inflict i have to get his boost now big challenge here yeah make him back off smart one touch to myself take a shot see if he does save take another one click jump here make a panic i couldn't get the angle it was the right idea though actually really good play up to that point gonna go back down to the ground it's a good challenge i didn't have to flip into it or anything it's a lot of pressure on him now again a lot of pressures being put on him here i don't have to do much really take a turn on this one touch take a shot put him in as many awkward situations as possible it's gonna have very little boosts here so it'll be fine he has to hit that ball away there i know that it's a good save there we go come on on top there i got him to overcome for one ball again he's hoping that every single 50 is going to turn on his way it's a very very good and and bad way to play this i think yeah look at the goals that have been scored against me so far this game right two of them picking off goals one of them has been a 50 straight to my net so it doesn't really feel like we're getting outplayed or like we're out of control of the game at all again that's not really a challenge most people go for most of the time you lose it might not work out for him though i end up messing up i missed the boost yeah i should have put that to the boost instead i'm for the shot i played that ball to the booster much better take a touch here he's got control a little bit awkward spots here he doesn't look comfortable when he's on defense and any situation i'm putting him in it's a really good recovery there we go good goal it's a very weird situation to get out of to be honest but we covered well got up the wall beat him to it as well try to save some boost on this kick off 100 boosts here just wait for the ball to come down fine as long as it doesn't go straight internet like the first goal we're chilling see he does he has to jump for this he's on target there we go a little bit of pressure put on him ends up panicking a little bit it was the goal we needed the big goal to go two goes up have to be careful that one kickoff i think we're good now play it to the right i don't have to go for a shot there we go well played you knew you couldn't win anymore i was gonna play for the boost play for the ball play for the time there's not really anything you can do but just try to be aggressive there but yeah good game we adapted well three is playing it's a very weird place though to play against he's very high ranked right now i think so it's a good win a lot of points hope you guys enjoyed having us have a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are watching this like comment subscribe let us know on the next one i love you peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
