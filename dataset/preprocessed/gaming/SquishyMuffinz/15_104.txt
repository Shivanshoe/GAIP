yo what's up guys gonna be playing three for today with torment and one of my should be some good games let's get into it let's try to get top ten in three with you we're going for top thirty and unbelievable right now we're 50 third and ones for 33 in twos and we're 28 in three so let's try to get top 10 in every leaderboard that's the goal right now so let's see if we can do that we're pretty close i just recently started grinding we were able to get this high up on every leaderboard so i think if we can stay winning stay on the grind we can get up to top 10 top five and everything can be sick so yeah let's get into it all right we got a sweaty game here we got dude meccos and sicky not gonna be easy one by any means see what we can do put some pros in here good stuff from him i'm behind but i get some pads probably bang this should be a good situation for us he's awkward last back for a while uh i tried to get like the perfect pop corner shot but it was so hard to get an angle on where it was there better just bump him off that anything to get in the way he's fine really if i play corners if he does he misses perfect then go for a bump there we go just being a menace as soon as we get that that high touch there it's gonna create a lot of space for tour he actually missed the boost it was in a really bad spot but he had that much time to um you know recover from that situation and actually get to go out of it it's how important those bumps are in those spots all right first touch here it's fine and just wait for his hits it's gotta like kind of gauge how much danger is involved and all those touches and if any of them are actually worth challenging early then do it if not then just wait because there's no danger there's no point of throwing away your position take both their boosts here should be fine and you'll always see me play patient no situation just because i don't want to give up a goal challenging something bad that i don't need to so i always i always just kind of judge the situation based off how much threat there is right one of the chances that a good shot can actually come of the next touch they're gonna get and if it's low i'm not gonna go really good pass from wanda well done i like those pop passes because look how much space how much time it gives me i can lock my eyes on the last defender back as soon as he jumps take my time get a good touch around him very good pass utilize that space fake this here now backflip good timing on that challenge play off the back wall i want to actually follow this would be crazy if you got it behind you the challenge right back wall very good demo every touch instantly shoot one almost got a crazy dunk on that trying to shoot low i couldn't get a great shot on that with where i was coming from and how high the ball was so i just decided to save my boost play for the next couple of touches instead and it's gonna actually get us a goal i think yes it will was able to keep full boost off of that play instead of just you know going all in on that shot it's a lot better of an idea if just say on this didn't land the greatest but should be fine shadow with dash back maybe get this full boost that was a good block and we got a really good clearance of it as well so again look there's one opportunity one flippy setting here and i have a teammate going backwards i don't need to jump just trying to understand what the threat is there and as soon as i realized there really is it none i don't have to do much finally going to beat me to that but i'll keep my boost stay back watch the bumps i saw someone around there should have one more touch it looks like can't really shoot off that's a little bit too far so i decided to jump anyway in case maybe they go and like hit it into me or something i get lucky the chance that could happen top corner maybe sir got it we still got it all right that's enough game one let's get into the last game of the video so you can keep it up get back to back dubs what am i asked to go in eight minutes so hopefully we can find the game and play it before eight minutes are up so i can't play more than one more game let's see how it goes all right for the last thing we got patty keep and dude nice shoot from tor i like the patience on that cheek it's actually very important there because if he over if he over cheats so kickoff wasn't the greatest and it would have been probably pretty bad for us to be honest try this 50 me keeps it in the corner for my team if someone's a little bit closer you're actually really good but i don't think they expected it to go there i played back to wanda that's good too we fit today back to the one side for us the first touch let him touch this around me that's okay to be honest don't mind that the next guy's gonna have to force that touch regardless it's gonna be a goal probably which is why i don't mind that okay so i'm first man challenging that i know someone's behind me worst case scenario the next guy that gets the balls probably going to sort of wait for the guy behind me and also there's also that off chance that the guy beating me just hits the ball straight to my team and he gets a three ball as well so that's why it's important to challenge when it's your turn to challenge because you're gonna get a lot of good opportunities up just challenging them the right times one that just made a little bit of a mistake back there but it doesn't happen very often one of those things that's uh a rarity and then you know if you see that happen in your wonder mic there you just gotta recognize them simple mistake i know what to do next time it's fine that's why i like making another mistake that's the best mistake to make because you know it's as simple as just you know one little mechanical area that's it gonna beat me to this next touch so i'm just gonna wait a sec i wasn't expecting the demo so i was like i hate those situations because i'm i'm all in on the 50 there and then as soon as the demo comes through i'm actually not ready and i get a much worse touch because of the demo is really good but that's the thing about not being in and calms there in that situation is i don't know what's coming through harder though better bump him he's up for tour now one more touchdown probably i can't really follow that didn't leave me like on enough wasn't forward enough it was kind of just directly ahead of me stay from london oh yeah bones unfortunately i should have went solo to be honest the pass is never going to be great there should put this touch all the way back trying to follow this again it's a really good opportunity because i got lost back for a while should be able to keep this in nice it touches played around one just fake this good to keep it in i can go again if he misses here too can be wide by a bit unfortunate bounce maybe we could score though because that was a good read though on that guy's miss for sure pass off to wanda we have a good amount of pressure here though i can see it's getting angled soon there we go there we have a lot of pressure they're a little boost the positions we're putting the ball into are very dangerous they're on the the back foot every single time in a very like panicky situation every single time to get out of those touches that was well done from us leave them in those spots i passed the wonder to go back now i don't want to over aggress here challenge early i don't have any boosts i can try to pass this instead of shoot if i would expect it store should have i got to be careful here now i'm last back for a little uh that was really really awkward situation to get out of to be honest last back for a while there and if i had went right away i think i would have hit it into wonder mike for the way he was in front of the ball there i was kind of hoping one of them would be able to get away for me because i think we're kind of gonna get scored no matter what they're if they couldn't put them up for that just good bit of any boost here i have no way to pass that really but i still tried for it let's save it'll be fine we got a minute left here we can create some chances for sure we have a lot of time minutes in eternity still in this game i need to get myself some boost though so one thing you definitely need to create some opportunities that boost i haven't had much it touched me but might still be good for us can't really follow that hopefully it plays this over to a team and they can pass to me maybe nice to play that was a good uh set up for a counter attack there we had someone backfall and if that guy plays it backward we're just gonna get the ball for free so that's a big mistake from them that pretty much every everyone still makes they have the time on the ball there instead of slowing it down they just instantly throw away the ball and that gives us the ball back and allows us to actually make a play out of it so that guy pretty much set us up for for that play without knowing of course doesn't look like a bad touch in the moment but no reason why we can get a goal there the patience close maybe that was horrible actually now cut off the wall should be a goal ah i thought it was gonna be close to be honest i wasn't trying to shoot straight up there was one backfill but i played off back wall it's gonna be a little every single time if he's close enough but i don't think he could have been you must have missed a boost or something this could be really bad actually all right we're good i popped out one time should pass this shot now nicely done well done well done we clutched up because of it so the game though for sure very very sweaty game all right hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever happens when you guys
