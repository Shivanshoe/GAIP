yo what's up guys going to be playing some 1v1 games for today gonna be trying to get back up into the top hundred i've only been playing ones a whole lot so i decided why not it's gonna be fun it's gonna be some chill games let's get into it so you can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right after the first game we got ourselves against al-mudaka i think it's how you say that we found this game instantly so this guy has to be really close to my mmr it's gonna be a sweaty game i think should i make him do something here let's say from us we gotta wait a little bit play a little patient here we have full control of the ball though pretty much we know he has to come to us to get a shot from us there we go kind of baited him in a little bit i like to pull the ball away from their net it kind of creates some space between you their net and the ball and it's just gonna be overall really tough thing for them to stop because they have to come challenge the ball quickly and you have full vision of what they ought to do right so the same situation here i pull it to the side away from the net and it gives me a view of everything is the view of where he is what i can do with the ball and what the best play to make on the ball will be so that's why i like to do that i like to just pull it to the side like that either way it doesn't matter just a cut in field gives you a lot of space to work with um simplified wave is something like this where i can still see the player the whole time and as soon as he comes i can just make a cut toward the left then it's going to be a free goal ended up leaving really early but that's just a pretty simple way to get free goals and one big one um and there's a lot of like more advanced versions of doing that at quicker paces um and even three or three environments but that's a good example of something that i like to do that works really well in 1v1 as you can see you left really early it's a really quick forfeit so let's get into the next game let's even keep it up probably play two more games because that one was super quick see this next one goes all right for the first actual game we got ourselves don't know how to aerial again instaq so probably around my mmr i don't have backus mode on i should be using backus mod because then at least you'd be able to see what mmrs are any better viewing experience probably for you guys but it's okay i'm gonna get the boost here good touch from him it's a good block should be straight in to be honest take that honestly a weird situation there i had to rush that early because i don't want to give him time on the ball right you don't want to give anyone too much time on the ball in one so if you can cut off a plate at the source it's best to do that it's a really good block from him i'm gonna put it high into the corner i had to lay some time play off the back wall try to convert potentially good bump i find that being a goal for him i don't know if i can get back yeah that bump was just enough launched me all the way on to his side as well played i shouldn't have committed to the the shock anyway i didn't need to obviously i have a goal lead right so you don't need to convert to something like that it blocked from us play off the wall here not gonna be in but that's actually good enough to kill a lot of time for me but i don't mind that situation at all gonna grab the mid boost here let him have control i give him control over the mid boost i think it's worth it in that situation who should come back in a second he's gonna get it i think that's fine he has to go back to the boost most likely i'm gonna get the free possession here there it is he's going back for the boost finally and i'm gonna do a thing i was talking about separate myself from the ball create an awkward scenario for him to deal with good 50's he's gonna grab that mid boost for me but i can have possession of the ball here anyway it's not a bad situation for me not yet at least there we go we set a lot of boost after the 50 so that was pretty well played to be honest but good job from him to stay on the ball there really made the situation difficult he's staying on a pretty low boost which is actually really smart thing to do i'm not a very good afflict from me i can play it to the corner get the boost here gonna give me opportunity to create a play out of this big jump gotta make a panic a little bit really good save good recovery try to take the mid boost from him take a second and go for a shot here so he does make the situation as weird as possible for him try to stay on it even with not a lot of boost and be able to convert a shot out of it as well so taking high shots like that it's not a bad thing even if you're not going for the direct goal off the shot itself it's more about creating that pressure making them waste their boost and if you can take a shot try to show you guys an example you pretty much want to play the ball in positions where they have to go back and they have to gather boosts right so right there i forced him to either have to come toward me bait himself in or go all the way back and get boots which is going to give me a free possession and a free 1v1 play on the ball right so you don't want to really do that and i know that so i'm going to try to i'll play him early which is what i did there but what i was gonna say is if you can take an early shot that forces out boost that's the absolute best way to play a situation like that because if you could just take a shot that force them to jump they land in their net you can grab their corner boost force them in a position where they're stuck in goal you could just take shot after shot after shot and their life in general on defense will not be fun it will not be a very fun one to deal with stuff you're gonna be throwing their way i'll try to show you guys an example of that right now unless it challenges me early so right here i don't mind just taking a shot even if it's not great making his life awkward so this ball is still going to be mine the next little bit and if i bump him there that's fine too that's not even a bad outcome to be honest he played on the situation well but in general that's like the whole idea what i'm going for in those spots is trying to play it in a way that's wasting his boost but leaving the ball in a spot where i can fall up the next touch and be in an advantageous position this is a bad shot to go for because look where it lands me and his net right i'm gonna go back and let him have it when we went here might be a miss play because he's a good shot probably it's a good fake so that's a really tough situation to deal with on my end to be honest in hindsight i should probably say that to the wall or to the corner even though i could have got downward potentially i didn't know what he was going to do which made it difficult um but he has a lot to shoot on and i have to just try to play it as smart and as slowly as possible i put the bounty it's a good 50 not to go for the shut up shot so i played through the wall to myself and here's the situation just take a shot see what he does try to play off of it get a beat on him that's gonna be enough pressure to wear them down and get a go out of it it's a good example of it it doesn't have to be a shot that's going to go straight in like i said shot that just creates pressure and you're going to have an enough boost after effect to follow it up that's all you can really ask for in a situation like that yeah good game so far 52 seconds left you could definitely come back we got to watch out on our kickoffs the biggest danger point i'd say in a game like this let's get the reset i'm gonna go from us 44 seconds and we're widening the the margins here for the bounce let's take a shot from midfield even from midfield is fine to be honest again look at the situation horsemen to a weird spot get a demo and i have full possession of the ball again i'm gonna take one more touch here and again just blast a shot on goal make him have to make a save if he doesn't make the save then i have control of the next play the next situation i don't have any boost anymore but it was a good idea i popped it up higher once fake jump here fake jump one more time oh my god a weird dunk autumn a weird 50. let's give the goal there all right eight seconds left no coming back from this one but it's a good game he actually played really well to be honest put up a good fight and the situation that he needed to challenge me at the right times made difficult there we go double flipping said zero second goal solid way to finish off the the first real game since the other game was a quick forfeit let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get back to back to back dubs and we'll get well into the 1400 range i think so let's get into the next one see we can do all right for the last thing we got to rematch i can see him coming out the gates a little bit harder here a little bit faster you know what to expect we're gonna go for a double reset off the bat here give you a musty all right good start i don't know why we're peeking start off with the double santa musty all right all right all right i could just tell all the incoming comments i'm gonna make the title insane double reset must be play question mark and then someone's about to comment he titles it like that but in the game he's like all right every single time you guys always make those comments it's true though i'm not someone to get like overly excited about stuff i mean i'm here to win at the end of the day i'm trying to win and i've seen pretty much everything there is to see in the game in terms of scoring goals so i'm not gonna react extremely excited but i do know when something is a good goal obviously i'm not gonna pretend like i don't know what a good goal is you know what a fake challenge here really good 50 for me honestly well played gotta play this to the other wall get this back boost gonna pop up let me go for a quick shot here i don't think you would expect it there we go most people on ones tend to control a ball like that it's just slightly hovering off the wall so it's a really good thing to just boom sometimes if you know you can catch your opponent off guard in a situation like that i'll play a bad get possession here not full boost try to save all my boosts in a situation actually really good challenge i'll play so i tried really hard to save all my boosted situation kind of ended up biting me in the butt a little bit he single jump toward the ball i think and i pinched it off the wall just a little bit around me gave him the opportunity to get a goal there as well played you don't see a lot of touches like that that often go for a flick here really good flick we're just hitting all of our shots for some reason tough one to stop for sure even if you're positioned well it's a really tough one to stop got bumped back into our corner boost which is really fortunate for us not the best touch but i have 80 boost here after this pad so i'm pretty good position i'll just front flip flick see what he does force out an awkward situation for him again played out the wall in a weird way let's go quick maybe you won't expect it play a little bit weird sometimes a little unpredictable it's fine i can get the back boost here might end up getting scored on still we got away with it get our other corner boost make him have to back off a little bit play it to the wall get the other mid boost here it's playing the spots where we know we have the advantage in the next follow-up that's what we're trying to go for at all times it's a good bump we might be able to turn it in here another good demo i wasn't trying to but i'm gonna get the mid boost here ski respawn spawn the other side we have a lot more time than we think we do play it over him that one second of extra information there i checking behind me kind of gave me the idea of when he would be able to challenge the ball if he went at absolute max speed so we knew he'd be ready for him and he was able to get the flick over him because of it so that's well played we go for a quick single jump shot on goal so he does same situation his last one you make him have to kind of make an awkward play here go for a bump on him make his life awkward don't give him free time on the ball i know if he flicks that i can still get back like this situation right here so keep yourself in a spot where you can react to both the good and the pad and not with easy stuff like i just did right there kind of rushed it didn't need to rush it he was playing patient on it if i took my time as well it would have been fine yeah try to react to the good and bad in the situation there that one exception i didn't react to the good and bad i only positioned for the absolute best case scenario and that was me being able to read him and i misread him try to get this to the right side hopefully follow it up again not a very good kickoff but she better get back should be able to score this potentially it went down oh i didn't hit the post all right beautiful oh i'm getting bumped no well that was actually a good fake i got destroyed i could save i went for the bottom there a little bit sweaty a little bit sweaty but it works you block the path of what's in front of you and there's almost no way it can go wrong in that situation and affect this one make a panic not gonna flip toward this but i want to think that i might actually pressure that ball the challenge again i'm not going to have any threats here really but you play round one how to freestyle this i mean bump all right let's see if we can do here we have time on the ball good challenge gotta be very early it's not really giving any time for anything to form which is a really smart way to play one like i said that's a very like purifier way to not allow anything like crazy bad to happen if you just challenge at the source you don't give it time to perform right there are some shots that once you give it too much time it's a goal every time i think flip resets are one of those things that if you give it too much time at a certain point it's going to be a goal i think air dribble bumps in the same way so challenging at the source if he knows what i'm i'm going to be going for is a very smart way to deal with that and stop those things from potentially happening but those demos when you have someone chasing the ball back into their own corner going for a demo is super powerful in once you have three seconds to convert after that and that's more than enough to get the ball in especially if you're comfortable in many different situations good block his defense is super solid though tell you one more here there's a weird touch to throw them off all that's towards the wall the ball keep it up together no all right ggs was fun i hope you guys enjoyed the video for today a lot of fun playing once again we got over 1400 mmr i think off of that we can take a look real quick see what we end up on got a lot of good goals that flip reset uh musty flick that's a really good goal let's take a look at where mmr is after all is said and done we finish off at 1408 solid games all right i hope you guys enjoyed having such a wonderful day or night whatever time is
