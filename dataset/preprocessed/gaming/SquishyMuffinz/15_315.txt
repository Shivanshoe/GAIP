outscoring video we're currently at diamond one Division four at 885 MMR so pretty solid if we do get our wins today we might breaking it down into also guys I know there's a bit of white noise every now and then in the background on my videos that's because my furnace is on and every time it kicks on I can't really do much about it but it will be getting better throughout the year because I think we're gonna get a new one and it shouldn't be as loud so should be able to work that all out before the year is over anyone could deal with it as much anymore but it's always been a thing if you guys been watching my videos for a long time you would have heard that like slight white noise in the background that I can't quite get rid of in somebody's there somebody is it's not that's what it is so if you do hear it just bear with me appreciate you guys into the games are for today and hopefully we can get ourselves some let's go alright also switch our picture to a picture of Stanley from the office and our name is now Stanley as well so make sure we change that from the last video so no one could recognize this yeah I'm gonna chill back here interested to see how the rotations and stuff progressed as we go on here I'm gonna try to put a little more passive in the previous videos I did say a law in the comments I'm I'm playing really aggressive which might be why my teammates are playing full-time defense cuz I'm not sure how it works oh yeah yeah there we go got ourselves a ghost [ __ ] off the bat I'm just letting my teammates do the dirty work also guys I see all your comments like I read all of them trust me it's time for me to reply to every single one I reply to some of them but I do read every comment and I see a lot of you guys want to see me do is strictly trihard a road your grand champ like just straight-up trying as hard as I can to win isn't any games as possible without losing obviously and you know get as many cool goals as possible stuff like that we have one more play that's left and is a standard playlist so I could do the trihard ready grand champ it literally be called Shou hard road to grand champ if you guys want and I'll just literally sweat every game I shall to give you as many times as possible but I'll try to score every possible shot that I'll be giving every shot that I set myself up for I'll just score and that would be the whole point of the great inorder grand champ to see how many cool goals we can get just trying to win by as much as possible every single game because I know you guys like the reactions in chat when people get you know a little bit upset sometimes for some reason you guys do it you're watching that yeah I can definitely do that if you guys want and I know I see a lot of comments asking me to so let me know down below that something you guys want to see no problem at all doing that never got a one-goal lead still here almost got a second one my team is aren't bad at all you know just got played good defense oh no please no I don't save it nice oh no you question watch me oh no this is what you guys are saying in the comments as well and dude this guy's like passionate why you save your own goal I mean it could have been a mistake you know I mean obviously it wasn't but could have been it's around two and you guys also said that if it does happen to be a known goal like I hit it off the corner and day on goal then it's fun I don't have to do anything because I didn't actually make the whole goal it's not like I did it on purpose nice try I'll clean up the wall you I'm Lilly just have it plopped down middle for my teammate so getting a problem at all Jenkins sorry about that well my teammates feeling it I'm gonna wait here stay patient put off the wall right see me I sue they do Jenkins nice good patience to get it around that guy gonna go for a demo here keep it in the corner I want to put that middle because he's watching the mid pass and it's super obvious that even if this Frank very obvious it's gonna happen let my team a go first yeah I think I strictly like try harder to grand shape would be a lot of fun and wouldn't let me mean anyway which is nice but I don't know those too often just because it's obviously very unfair for the people I'm playing against almost around see you're at the mid beach I kill this guy maybe you're gonna open up some space not a terrible idea still have that Goldie let my to me go first he's in front of me I don't want to cut them off and go for some risky double commit it's fine might not be fine now carry yet I'm gonna stay with this my teammates are both behind me there so I don't have anyone the past middle to you I messed up my tush I was trying to control but I got a pinch instead sometimes if you just slightly off on the the first touch she'll just pinch it like that try I'll just keep this in here put forward to it's really far back to give me a free clear for you for them they waited and they bumped each other oh my teammate missed all right he should have this but I'm not gonna trust something to go back in case you never want to fully fully trust as a solo said it even though like you should if you're in a lower rank you should probably go for the safer option and go back cover for the miss especially if you have a lead like you don't need a force a goal in a situation like this oh no dude I slice up so hard I thought it's gonna be way close to it it wasn't gets over to third guy can't shoot teammates up for mid boost and I look to me got corner so much lwe even though I know I can't score there just to keep the ball and keep the ball in a spot where it's not dangerous for us I'm across there my teammates that over pretty easy for me to just keep it in here me baby so he got pretty heated there and I had the same phone shot I don't blame him though wouldn't be the two too early but rules are rules he says he all right though let's go we have to diamond to Division two already he said I know that to you let's get into the next one and hopefully get in the dough let's go all right let's give me all pretty much 800mm our players like only one view is not an addendum our is our team I said defending so it has to go to me should be the cheated I went for the left boost not to my bouche it's all good follow this up beat to to the ball two of them should never really beat Committee on that I like TV a boy I didn't realize she's gonna go for that I thought I was gonna be able to like get one middle quick but I should've known he wanted to go he was one to go play it down the corner off the wall termites are definitely any more solid and they're getting smarter with other position you could tell this time goes on nice past middle Chile right they're gonna kids scored so it's a good spot to leave it for an opportunity Passover was a quite ready for the double pop out there fighting let's see that a whole lot this rink we got there go for a bump bumped one job is still a [ __ ] for him I could grab some pads now all the potatoes it miss he did miss unfortunately but not much we could do about that I have to trust him in that position you should ever really be missing that why he wasn't even close target down again this whole challenge lost my teammates to being able to hit this shot but actually play more passive on defense into the day not allowed to like that to happen let your back yeah it's pretty obviously at all mr. just because their positioning was really bad there weren't a good spot to follow up any of that wasn't a tough ball at all but they just made it more difficult is it in pre position for where the ball is going to be that's fine tomato you touch this super confusing game so far I would say how's the back my teammate set another goal argued for a bit he's up for this pass to my teammate wide open net you missed all good though happens happens nice block I'm playing around this dude middle you jump to be there at least obviously got that boosts I'm here for the corner a good challenge I can grab is Boost it's good I had a bump as well just last for a little bit here there's nothing so some good spots to follow up a lot of this stuff try to help each other you always want a position kind of in twos like so you can help each other out and buy into that mean like every team is pushing up try to be with him to reacts whatever is gonna happen next shouldn't be one guy lone wolfing all offense that makes sense kind of hard to explain what I mean but should always always have someone in support great that has good that he was behind are you ready for that miss just keep it in got a bum taking all the boost nice challenge to fold it up keeping that in its over to but I died that one missed the beginning might actually be the only goal that goes in this game it's looking like at least one guy back team it's too slow I might have just scored I can argue very good do you minute hey it's all good a lot of whiffs cover do but and you can't expect everyone to be super consistent yeah my team at home shut the back right place up the corner all the both wet one of them touch it there that's all I needed this has much more solid than both my teammates feels like on the backboard of these dad played middle bumped one I believe you have a lot of pressure here teammate only problem is I can't store has to be one of them I'm back it's all I can do you mate turn on that yeah it was a tough one to win the team was just better yeah like my teammates they're in spots to shoot but they missed the chance they did have and that one goal they're just like a huge huge defensive mistake so we're pretty much in the same spot as when we started this video but when edit they're gonna keep it at 2 games of video to keep it at the same pace but yeah can't be too upset about that one you know some stuff didn't go our way is what it is good good spot to end off the video there we're still at Diamond too though we just division down to Division one so we're pretty but you're out diving one still but hopefully next video we get two wins and we get up to like diamond to division like for something like that that we were much closer to diamond 3 we'll see we're climbing though we're climbing though losing the game here there's not too bad cuz sitting out sup this challenge can be especially when we run a win streak that were on like our everywhere I get super high and then we get the lower room our players and their players much more so but you can tell a pleasure much more solid so it's definitely tough in that sense you just don't know what matchmake he's gonna throw your way but yeah anyway guys that's gonna be off this and I'll be guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is right now when you're watching this like comment subscribe and so you guys all in the next one love y'all peace you
