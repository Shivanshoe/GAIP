yo what's up guys so today's video gonna be trying out the brand new mclaren so we got ourselves the mclaren 765 lt and right now we're using this decal on it which is the one that comes with it the miami grand prix one and uh you can't change much about the colors off like the default decal so i decided to use this instead it looks more colorful more pretty um you can change these colors a bit actually you can't never mind i thought you could but i guess not but all good it's still pretty decal i think it actually looks a lot nicer than like the this paint finish with whatever whatever color you want i think this looks better but uh for the wheels i actually love these wheels i think they look sick i wish you could use them on oxtain but you can't you can't use them on anything but the mclaren which kind of sucks but the car looks sick i'm not gonna lie like this is one of my favorite looking cars in the world um and having a game is a pretty insane thing to see so hopefully it feels nice let's get into some games play twos and threes whatever we get we'll end up playing let's get into the games though should be some fun see how it goes all right we got a threes game off the bat got realized and vince against dimitri fizzy and lagley realizes afk hopefully he comes back i think he's here trying slightly different settings by the way guys the camera looks different because i am on different settings on slightly higher stiffness and some other settings are slightly different as well but it feels nice try running it trying to change things up a little bit which one around him i'm gonna make a weird for him take them into this here i gotta turn me boost fake this probably gonna think i'm gonna hit it so such will be worse because of it should be easy for us to clean this up now on the wall fake go onto the ground look at 50. grab the corner boost here i think it's the right play just stay across as an option nice it's actually really good to be there kind of like pounce on that opportunity really well past from realize all the pings are glitched but this might be the realize from the apac region which he's absolutely insane like by far the best player from that region so it's a pleasure to get him on our team here i think it is him i'm not sure because easiest way to tell is the ping thing and how to tell right now try to bump him should make easy for him to come in free follow best play to make there my opinion is going for that bump because i got over the first car really well it's one one for a long time if i go for the bump it forces stuff to be really bad and if i like can't get the bump it's a goal anyway and if i can't reach it like i did it still forces him super far into a bad touch which is good every outcome is better by going for the bump there it's basically what i'm trying to say contract for me i think it is realized because it looks very mechanical making a lot of really good touches take the corner boost tournament boost here should be able to have this if not i have the beat play to the wall for myself the patient should be fine i'll wait a cross if he wants to use me he's gonna wait i hear one jump right middle now may pass has been crazy but again in solo q3s like obviously you're not gonna trust your team every single time so i don't blame them and pop it up once should be able to follow it up here's a flip now nice take advantage of all the space i have today i love that situation is perfect really good you should that pop my teammate as well gives them a lot of options and obviously when you have someone like realizing your team is extremely mechanical i should have turned away so early that was a big mistake there that's kind of just autopiloting talking i'm saying when you have someone like realize though take advantage of that pop it up to them give them as much opportunity on the ball as possible i'm gonna wait middle here oh my gosh that's actually almost insane i trusted his uh his double and it came through almost got to go out of it really good teamwork mainly the big thing there is the trust that's the big thing that made that possible i'm trying to bump him off of there messed up my wall dash i want the chain dash a little risky to go for that but higher payoff if you get it with no boost gonna let him hit it to the wall go for some bumps here be annoying challenge good follow-up challenge one hit four would be huge actually can't but i'll still wait in an aggressive position either way there's a chance he gets this forward here get off the wall for my teammate i'll probably follow it up it's fine it's a little bit awkward i'm not gonna do anything with that and i got a demo which is good so i can do here solo try to bump them nice yeah i really think that's the best thing to do there just so much pressure gets created out of that you can get one more across it's going to be a goal really good save we got a little bit faster it's definitely going to be opportunity either way we still have a good pressure here i think i should have this is it done better for some wide it's fine it's not a big deal my role is definitely the challenge there it's the biggest thing to do in a situation played the miss actually really good job to go off top of the net smartest thing you could have done i think good cut i'm gonna fake this one there's sure presence and at least makes them throw it away which i think is always going to be uh what's best in my position there how about unfortunate no one's close use my right stick see that single jump i don't need to panic at all there that's how the rest is like super valuable just reaching like that if i like panic and get like a bad like throwaway touch always gonna result in the goal in the next like 15 seconds probably just because a little bit of extra panic so one second of using your stick like that helps you so much i think so yeah for a bump on the last guy car feels good by the way i can't tell if the car is really good or the settings i'm using feel good but very um in control this whole game of everything i want to do which is how you want to feel obviously in this game really good reach from him good double i was just going for the goal why not already have three goalies but yeah good first game super solid this car feels really good so far like i said hopefully it's not just a little like mini placebo i love it so far and i love these settings so i'm going to probably stick on these let's get into the next one so you can keep it up let go all right got a very very sweaty game here the last one we got shebex i'm not sure who he is but i've been um and a lot of really sweaty lobbies lately but everyone's really solid so we'll see good first challenge take the back boost here i recognize nitros is very solid it's a good challenge yeah all the way back they must have spawned there because i was covering up that's how i feel that's why i don't notice about the spawn it's not like fully random i know it's like majority of the time like most of the time not always there are some occasions where like it'll spawn you in the same spot as your teammate but it'll try to like separate you if you're if you're in the same spot as the spawn that's going to try to spawn you their teammate the other side so i noticed you can kind of like guess the spawn off of that sometimes turn again for a challenge actually really good try on the shot could have been a goal still could be a goal nicely done very good shot there the turn quick creates a lot of pressure another chance i could have been a goal and good turn in general stay on that and be aggressive i'm behind my teammate here he should go first just bait any kind of touch if he gets over him it's fine as long as he dispossesses him in some way and he did that nicely done he kind of made a mistake in my opinion because like he went again like he baited it well but he went again and this touch would have been bad it would have been to the corner you can see it's actually been to the corner but the confusion probably helped us out in the end and i got a stick also ended up working out this car feels really nice though i actually really like it a lot i love these settings things are insane it off the wall to myself well these things are crazy actually i feel like so crazy it's actually crazy this car feels good too this is a hard game to win this is a really hard game to win we're doing a good job save really challenge gotta go for the bump after let me get a bad follow-up touch didn't plays like a second patient for me be perfect he's actually just leaving it for me straight up she's really smart i have a good 1v1 here nice can drink maybe good follow-up from uh from nitrous going back there that's smart wait for the shot it's fun get patience there again the turning like i'm doing over and over again it'd feel like that is so p and twos i think because you're just covering so much space i turn you repeatedly like that i'm gonna take them mid boost gonna stop there push down field if he gets here if not it's fine i can just easily control this out actually done wait for this that shoot i could just play patient there's no threat here unless i make there like be a threat by challenging badly so if i just play it patiently nothing that he can do there again from here he's not going to score this air dribble it's going to be a pass he'll be trying to get it over him so i know that and i can put the position to my advantage almost insane play i don't know why i'm i feel crazy now i really do think it's the settings i think it's a car as well like a mixture of both like two new things i really think these settings are really good though it's a good demo chase from him i think they're kind of out of options it feels like like they don't know what else to do it's fine take advantage of that really good challenge teammate just plays like a second page for me again and we're good he's no play on this it might be bad now because he's got the back boost he's not not going but it should be okay so good flick let's follow up play right one time maybe i've been crazy also i heard voice chat's coming to rl again like actual proper voice chat should be really good content i think i think it'd be funny i'm excited for that see how it ends up being for the wall bands good challenge well done i kept it in this spot where he's not gonna get a gold shot off the challenge though which is smart as well really good beats gonna block him he make him better maybe good challenge actually really good flip we're all laying back here what a flick actually really good hold on good shot much i could do there honestly like i gotta play what i think is best in situation and i thought he had no more flip so likely had the flip kind of throws off my whole attempt at defense there i could have been gonna fake yeah he was up like really quick for that there's no point in me going fast as well if i play back to my teammate to a safe space i have five seconds to kill and we catch the dove ski middle maybe good cut from him past mid can i have a flip maybe okay good games though i actually had a lot of fun this video felt really good but like i actually gained a lot so that's really good really uh nice to see that for once i actually feel like i gained quite a bit from uh those games and these new settings that i'm trying so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the chat this car if you enjoy it make sure you use code switching weapons at checkout if you do want to buy it would be much appreciate i love you guys so much thank you for all the support appreciate y'all i'll see on the next one peace you
