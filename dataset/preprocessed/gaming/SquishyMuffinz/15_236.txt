yo what's up guys going to be playing some twos for today by myself not playing with anybody but the solo queue grind is in full effect so let's get straight into it hopefully we can get some wins let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing is josh and titanium and we have karma on our team so solid teammate against two solid players so we'll see how it goes definitely winnable but definitely loseable rank these days the highest level is uh very like coin tossy type of way i feel like everyone's so good nowadays you don't ever really have a easier lobby or never feels that way at least like it used to i feel like rewind back two years there's so many lobbies that feel like it's very one-sided but now you never really feel that way there's definitely better players still players that are better than others for sure but the gap is nowhere near as big as it was nice good job that was good from karma to slow down there my challenge is a little bit bad because i ended up in their goal but it was good in a way that i went to my teammates i was trying to get that over to their side but i wasn't sure if she'd be ready for it should i get behind here very quick not bad if i can get a demo here would be huge but i can't because he jumped early i'll try to get back here get the boost with the ball let's go for something alone here see what went up so i tried to dunk them only way i can help out here is by trying to bump so i'm gonna do that but it's still not enough unfortunately because karma still got beat by that that touch over here here i'm gonna call it nice let me go for a backboard hit it's actually really good for us might even be a goal close i'll let him go it's fine got him off guard with that there we go those are actually really good touches those little taps off the wall to yourself they're huge as long as you don't get demo there like that guy is right on me there you just gotta make sure you don't get demoed and you're good i think his teammate might have expected me to die which is why that works so well let's try and the speed there it's gonna wait then i'm panic i shouldn't actually have jumped for that ball at the end there on honestly only helped him didn't make any better for me i should have bumped this guy now too out of the play because of one bump it's pretty big nice cut around one oh my gosh that's almost insane i almost got a flip set off of that nice it's a good shot good placement to find that day not the best touch from him though he had a lot of space those are the situations you have to take advantage of when you have that space like that ah see that should have been a goal that's what i mean by taking advantage of your space instead of just throwing that ball away and shooting it when he's gonna save it every single time because he's good enough to use that space more wisely and try to try to control the ball like what he's doing right now is really good because creator to play out of it instead of just wasting it early that's fine still on the ball here it's really not that bad of a situation to get beat there i could leave now should be okay for karma as long as i get a really good shot here should be fine i'm gonna wait here nice if she follows this huge one more that's fine i kind of have to challenge quick there that guy beats me i'm already committed on the wall so it's a risky situation for sure nice just gonna wait here to karma got the boost which is huge i just make him think i'm gonna go pass back to her close almost and that he play way across here everyone's so good in n a now reading those cutting those off those infield passes plus i'm just gonna go for a mid boost there is none so just go back that's fine the other beast will probably be up by then there we go a little awkward but we got a it almost got a goal of it too he's going to have that most likely really good control it's really smart but he has no boost so this play is going to die in a second the karma you gotta be careful the flick here nice i just let her have it's fine it wasn't too dangerous i knew the ball was gonna bounce before the goal line those air dribble bumps are only super dangerous if if you have to jump for the ball and i didn't there but it's still probably going to be scary situation for a bit decent 50 car master plate is really smart though nice huge play there really good touch to yourself i'll just try if i kill them that's really good should be fine that should be the game no one's going to be able to follow it up and i can kill a lot of timing i full boost i held on to it that should be dead now unless karma wants to keep it up which i'm fully down for i'm down for another goal oh couldn't quite but good first game for sure you played super solid could have played better in some aspects of the game for sure but there's not a game where you can never play perfect and rocket league there's no way it's impossible to have a perfect game but let's get into the next game see if we can keep it up let go let go all right so we got cynical against forkey and wonder mic this is a sweaty game for sure here we'll see what can be done though two very um high rated grand champs i'm not actually sure who my teammate is but i don't know why he wasn't able to save that i'm not gonna lie d i want to see the situation i just don't know why he didn't jump or try to save it oh he had so much time it's okay though it's a simple mistake obviously one that he probably doesn't make so if you're him you just gotta ignore that and move on he's gonna hit that around i'm just gonna wait it's fine it should be really good for my teammate i don't want to rush that let's get a bad hit all right interesting uh gameplay so far to say the least i got to fix this real quick i think i accidentally put this on the wrong thing there we go it's better okay all right they're missing the kickoffs i don't know what's happening this game let's ignore the first 30 seconds yeah it's been uh been rough to say all these put it around one do that for my teammate okay he wasn't quite ready for the pass i don't like the way this game feels so far it's very scary it's like a lot of really bad goals are gonna go in my goals that just shouldn't go in nice over one he's not quite ready for it but you can get the boost at least just leaves me in a weird spot now yeah i bumped him though which is good as long as he doesn't die i'm chilling should be fun okay i bumped them didn't really do much for some reason try to get this to the right here that's fine might get the boost pretty good for us me my teammate are not on the same page whatsoever but i'm just gonna keep going keep on trucking my bms you're good you're good you're good we're just not playing well together synergy's not there right now good read let's go or not ah he kind of just i think he's overthinking situations when he should just do what his instincts telling him like there he probably could have just banged it and i feel like you over thought it and thought that just waiting is the better player there but almost never is that was really good though i don't know what he just did but it was good should i just play more patient around my teammate so i don't leave him in these situations where he has to be awkward he's gonna be behind me should be a ghost though he's a little further back than i thought ah this is actually really bad now he doesn't go yeah that's gonna try to help nice i'm gonna fake this it's good for us ah close i didn't have enough boost at the end there for what i wanted nice headed to open space was really good for us now they're gonna be in an awkward spot they have to kind of hit this to me fight a little bit more boost again it could have probably got the 50. it's close should i be into this boost it's a big demo for them good hit should be able to beat him in a 1v1 here which is big it's fine i don't have to jump there that's not a spot where you need to jump because i'm going to be stuck in their half even longer this could be really good for us nice yeah and it's not like that i'm not going to dive in in front of their goal when they're blocking the shot obviously i want to just make them get a hit that's going to go to the left wall or right wall and that could just go back quickly so that's why i just driving into the ball there's better but in that situation that my teammate was in before if you can clean beat him to the ball just cling beat him around and it'll kill time for me instead of i wasn't able to rotate back yet and then he was trying to do what i just did but he got dunked and i can actually help him out there there we go playing solid though this is a really good uh set of players mechanically for sure it's always tough to play against mechanical players and twos you gotta stop a lot of different you know possibilities it's the hard part by a little bit more boost man just running out in the worst spots but that means i'm not positioning myself properly if i'm running out there i'm not positioning properly beforehand that's where the issue is i can't just blame that i'm running out of boost right you gotta look at the deeper issue what's actually causing that try to go back here get some pads teammate's going to be going up for a while because he's just aerial super high i don't watch out for a bump yeah it's almost impossible to get out of that situation because the first guy's bumping me i have to jump over him he just went for the bump [ __ ] away so i jumped over the first this guy's gonna put me on the wall as well so i have to jump early almost nothing i can do there that situation is really tough want me to deal with because of the bumps that's over two i got a bump though unlucky but i'll take it i'll definitely take it big beat there i was really big to get her both of them but yeah good set of games guys i hope you enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day
