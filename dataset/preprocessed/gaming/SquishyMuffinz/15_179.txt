yo what's up guys gonna be running some twos with garrett for today i'm pretty sure he's pretty high rank right now so we're getting back up to supersonic legend we're getting closer and closer at 1740 mmr right now pretty sure we're on a pretty good win streak right now so let's get into it see we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a 20 first game shout out to that plenty of corrupted g and sea bass i'm gonna call it probably just gonna do left to go as i'm guessing on our team normally garrett has priority over me but it's just ranked so doesn't need to be that serious there's a good air dribble bump i went super quiet there just focusing on trying to hit it the shop and gary could attempt both of these players like to just keep the ball extremely close so becomes sort of a mini chess match in a way who's going to make the first mistake who's going to give away possession first it does become a little bit uh difficult for sure the way they play it out but if you play patient back normally the opportunity will eventually present itself you just have to hit the shot as you see right there pretty much the situation i'm talking about 20 in 40 seconds but a mistake will come sooner or later sometimes it's very later but not a bad start at all it's gonna have a double here so i just gotta wait good challenge from us i swear playing ones a lot recently has helped me a lot with challenges something that i will say ones definitely helps you with is making sure you take your challenges better like that situation i don't even need to flip into that it's not really going to be that bad gary can just clean this up pretty easily most time most of the time he'll clean that up pretty easily and it'll be easy for us to get the countertop going forward that's why it's not bad to lose a 50 in that situation this is a bad situation to be in though so many options you got to get above the ball as much as possible avoid getting bumped because you always got to be cautious of that potential air dribble bump as well right but you see how slow every single touch they take is they try to just keep everything to themselves everything controlled that's what makes these twos games very difficult i played off the wall for garrett playing those laterally like off the wall like that's always good because it comes back to your teammate i'll miss every single time i'm gonna just kill time for gear to get behind me here a lot of space might as well use it you touch from garrett played high off back wall it's to make both of them jump which is good it's never a bad thing unless gear loses that 50 hard which he didn't he knows he doesn't need to try to win that let's play it awkward for him yesterday gets bothered just back up take all the time he needs good kill from us let's see best panic stay right side if he wants to use me he's gonna fake jump i don't actually want to commit to this fully because even best case scenario all he's going to do here is to just await us most likely he's gonna have to flick here i put that pretty well pop it again if gary gear was followed you can it's good to play those soft touches into the air as well for your teammates because they can almost always get to touch on that obviously what you want out of that situation really good save i try to play it as low as possible i saw him going off the top so i figured the higher i can get above this ball the better it'll be he actually did a really good job to save that i shouldn't have jumped two but i was thinking maybe we can get some cool play i was thinking content shouldn't have been but i was thinking content tried to go for the bump yeah this playstyle can definitely be annoying to play but that's definitely how most people play now the higher level players at least they tend to favor this controlled play style way more than just banging it away very few players very few teams just bang the ball away every time though everything's an air dribble everything's a slow dribble to themselves actually messed up almost worked though he didn't get a flip out of that that's what kind of threw me off pretty hard there challenging forget i feel like a lot of like lower ranks won't really understand this playstyle it looks like a lot more like dumbed down there's not a lot of high flying aerials it's very riskless right but it's very like high pressure on your brain you have to think so much more than before that's the thing that makes it difficult because one little mistake could get you scored on right so it makes it hard get the challenge everything perfectly force every angle force everyone to just miss their touches can play it around them i don't need to go for a shot here playing the boost instead here it's a mid option just play it across though if he wants stay on that i honestly thought gabe messed up there but this is going to be bad enough let's find gears got balls of steel it's going to be the last folding game and there we go it's kind of what i was talking about the exact same thing happened for about three or four minutes straight controlling the ball over and over again blocking every angle there will be some barely missed shots because you're forcing the angle right every single time that you challenge air dribble or something like that you're forcing them to go behind you for your teammate or you're forcing it to go over for your teammate to fall off the next touch it's almost the only way to deal with some of these shots these days because they're very very mechanical they're very tough to deal with right so that's the hard part about this play style is you have to play everything to perfection or else you're gonna lose the game and uh we did a pretty good job of that but the goals are very tough to come by and it comes down to hitting your shots when you have those very few opportunities that one shot where i try to place lower than him when he was going off the top of the goal that's an example of a shot that i needed to hit in a different way and a better way to get a goal out of that because that's one of the few opportunities you need to score but yeah get into the next game get another dub and uh hopefully we can end on a good note that's a very sweaty game though all right we're surely gonna have another sweater game here roll this place identical to what i was talking about in the entire last game so we'll see see what'll come of this okay i should have this touch right here i'll wait back wall all you can really do here is play this back wall touch it again just flick on goal see what it does i'll just be annoying here good bumps from us try to turn this again to keep it in actually really good play from gabe put that super well no boost here just got to play it to the corner makes the situation kind of awkward but it's fine covered most of the angles i'm just getting destroyed in goal here well gabe's just bumping me he's getting one way through the other side of the field his teammate i'm not gonna go for this i kind of want him to just throw it away i made it for my team instead he ended up backflipping which gives us that one opening unlucky i think garrett might have got just bumped barely good 50 let's go across here i was just baiting that ball out again the 50 from us you actually get the next ball he's a minute 1v1 here i sit down good shot well done all done so in that situation again i'm just trying to force out a play that gives garrett a better ball right i'm the first man in that play i gotta do something creative something that makes it difficult for their defense to deal with right it's gonna be tough for garrett but i believe in him i'll say for me good job cover the past there's a very awkward situation i'm gonna go with the wall here kill time forget to get back as well i never wouldn't win this situation like that coming time for your teammates to go back a boost and you're also able to get a potential solo play and a potential goal out of it right definitely a win-win there like gary get this boost potentially actually i stole it back soon it's fine better than them getting i think they would have won that boost battle that'll just be annoying go again here save from gate try to take the boost i had to go for the 50 there i was maybe gonna pass the garrett if david waited an extra second actually good of him not to pass over to him now nice shot good job well done from garrett playing very solid i'm just trying to look for him when i can and again just find those few situations where you can actually convert it into a goal and try to make the most of it i'm trying to go for a goal here it's more just to kill time for garrett again let him get into a prime position where he has boost and rotate around here with low gear should go for me again though baited out the flick so i can actually challenge try to go for a bump here anything's fine i can just go back now let him shoot this ah not bad honestly a mistake for me that was just bad positioning if anything i would say if i'm a back wall it's easy to deal with if i wait where i was just makes it awkward i can't tell if it's a shot if he has it again you never want to have your back facing up play like that that's kind of where i went wrong i'd say all good the stuff happens should i beat him to the ceiling makes gabe force a touch out should be okay to deal with this for the demo instead of the shot should give garrett a free goal as well i figured i couldn't do anything with the ball i might as well go for the demo instead that was definitely the better play to make demos don't give you any points in that situation but that pretty much guarantee that's the goal demo should definitely give you points i should be like an assistant for sure there's so many things that go unnoticed statistically you know what i mean i was a better save so that was like good correction from the previous mistake we made we went back all day and it makes that much much easier to deal with i'd say didn't want to go for the straight up shot because garrett's in their net at that situation so trying to put that in a way that's much safer if things go wrong right i'm trying to go over some cheeky if i had time to get a double tap there but i was realistically never gonna happen it's a good demo from us or a good like attempt at a demo killed both got the boost as well it's gonna gear into 1v1 there we go another two demos that gave garrett a ton of space ton of time well played from us all right good two games for today i did not mean to put no problem but uh we probably divisioned up into grand champ three we did for grand champ three now so that's pretty good we're one step closer to supersonic legend we'll probably reach in a couple videos uh but yeah we already got we're already top ten in uh in 1v1 right now which is sick we're gonna keep grinding that gonna try to get maybe number one but yeah if you guys aren't subscribed to the channel and you do enjoy the content that you see over here make sure you do hit that big red button and make sure you also leave a like in the
