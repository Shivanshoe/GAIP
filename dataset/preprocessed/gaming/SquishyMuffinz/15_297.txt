brand new video thank you so much for all support guys and I hope you enjoy today's video which will be the final video over the road to grand champ but I can't score series and like I said in the video after this we'll get back into a regular high level gameplay videos enjoy yourself guys in the last video we finished off at 1280 MMR at champion three division four and for today we're not gonna be doing the but I can't score part of this challenge anymore we're literally just gonna try to get the green chamber they're just gonna try to score whatever opportunity to give it to us how do you guys made tips along the way in these two games hopefully when both we should win both the British trying to score you I think but yeah I don't know it's been the most frustrating five videos in a row I swear where every single of those videos is very winnable everything once the game is so winnable if my teammates is shot like a little bit harder or just hit the ball made any cons I got so many shots okay so many opportunities it's just not there and then a defense is just lacking it's just like I expect them to go I'm so used to like high level gameplay people just going going going and it's just or nothing so it's it's really hard the situation that I'm in right now and I think the best way out of it is literally just get this series done with because it's not good for me at all it's just bad mentally I'm gonna enjoy myself I'm not enjoying the content that this is producing because I'm not like I don't know I'm not having fun I want you guys to watch me have any fun not watch me be frustrated at not knowing what the hell my humor screaming to do and then just being like confused and then they're not there for shots and then we lose to some stupid stuff and then I just get annoyed and then repeat so it's gonna go on later relief forever literally forever until eventually I get lucky like a hundred episodes from now when it's already the year 2021 hey guys that's pretty much it let's get to the games let's see how it guys we're getting this over with guys we're just gonna play it as if we're we're trying to win I'll give you guys many tips as possible let's get these two wins dude I never want to touch so low standard again never ever gonna touch this put this ever again I promise you guys that never making another us it a bit like like the rubber grants for threes very much to be honest I think you guys prefer to Xion ones I think it's just cuz those are the most like popular game modes it's probably what it is but yeah let's just get this done I like to play this to the side here five of space to play it see my teammate so try to pass I've sold the passive on tip I shouldn't be in solo seder Italy I mean affiliates solo standard the palm of the series is so centered isn't a passing oriented like game mode it's it's very carry based it really is like once you get into the higher ranks like Ram right now every single lobby you guys have seen me lose it's been one person carrying and the other two guys not being able to the bolt absolutely how it is once you're trying to get to a grand champ that's why this whole challenge is literally impossible once you get to this point it's literally like you get hard stuck and yes eventually like I said you can get out of this situation but it's a matter of luck hopefully I don't score it all in these two games and me just playing how I'm playing like just trying to get hard well like somehow be enough to mess them up my teams can get the goals that be the best bet but if I score I really care at this point I've been through enough torture I haven't been able to give you guys proper tips I'd rather like do like pro games and give you guys proper tips and play this and just not want to ever play this game again because of how annoying the seems to be yeah I'm gonna get my team in here I hope at least from the series that you guys got enough like useful tips out of it yes similar enough out of it I can't get back to the might seem it's not back I'm furbished bad situation I can't get back regardless I have to try to go to force to touch my teammate she just went straight back to goal and I go for [ __ ] here when the ball is in midfield it's probably best about there the position I'm in I can't really help out at all [Music] dude I'm so annoyed I don't even want to play this game anymore I literally want to retire I'm retiring for this game it's supposed it's just bad this scheme what's bad why does this meet at the game anymore every word is like uncoordinated no one knows anyone's doing just hit the ball just hit the ball so you gonna do what's a teammate what like why and then they have a ball for free round one I'm just a gofer goals you go for a bunch of the solar stuff probably it's my best bet honestly it's your free much stuff to go around this yes maybe set up emptiness for them oh you candy but this is it's like it feels like every lobby we've played in the other team is just better the other team is just better played [Music] [Music] nice it's possible possible to win this I guess but I don't know dude I've lost all all hope in all my team every single every single time I I get a lead early in these games it just goes downhill way too quick Shane off the back I'm still like kind of pass I don't know I'm sound like a passing made should we go for more shoulder [ __ ] but I want to win legitly with the serious why didn't I keep cutting off everything every single time I was face close obviously I can't go for shots that like normally force out chances like that obviously to keep on outscore now at this point though but normally it throughout the series if I have a chance to shoot on goal I literally can't go for it because of the chance I could score back soon that's not something I would do in a normal game Jenny I mean I would normally go for a shot this ball I bet these guys passed the ball time I wouldn't even be able to like shoot off that ball I'm lands well why wait why is this guy touch the ball so much like for no reason where you get scored on I can't I can't believe some of the stuff I'm seeing I really can't John this guy I've known with the lack of trust I think it's like a trust there's no one trusted earlier in this road the biggest issue and he's not a why do I not to shoot keep forgetting I could score now I've been putting this like hours tonight just trying to get great shape and I swear my brain is now forgotten that I can shoot the ball oh yeah feels nice pill to hit the ball again on goal I just gotta get myself to remember that I can shoot now that's the hard part the series is so bad for me though I do I do gotta stop it I like the challenge of it but this point the challenge of is just more frustrating than anything so I'm gonna get it over with we got within one point we got legitimately within one point of a grand champ but that's how much this game hates me tonight we got literally this close without scoring 1293 but the game didn't want to give us to us to like one more can we do and then how many games did we lose it over time that could have went the other way it's so sad man so exciting to the last game though hopefully we can get the win and just be over and done with soul standard for every I'm telling you right now after the series I am not touching so Lysander ever no matter what you guys asked me to do I don't want to see this game-mode again I'm so sick of it you you have no idea I'm going to be playing skiing for four hours tonight just sold standard try not to score it's it's so hard it's just so hard alright we would be against roll this for the GC game hopefully my teammates or the goats I'm not saying this guy and of course you know it she's classy that's just how my how my day's been going it really it really has been you know what's new what's new I really just haven't been out my days being literally literally the worst possible day broccoli I could have had today oh man I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I hate everything I just I really do hate everything at this point not another fan every single thing we get sort of I pinch instantly and they medially get that it's nice we're dad - OH immediately it's cool it's gonna start hopefully it could be turned around don't have much face but yes to them go and we'll be good to go to teammates course this guy's given up already surely not surely not why is my teammate giving up dude if this guy could just hit the ball that'd be fantastic if you actually like played the game I think we wouldn't see him but you actually come back just like instantly - oh yeah what but why and he's free jumping I know through the walk I can't do any of this lady's gonna have to just be like solo plays to win this scene again what feels like teammate please to be in yeah guys I'm so annoyed by this scheme tonight I'm sorry these videos lots of you tears have been terrible I won't lie to you I apologize for being irritated but if you were me trust me any sane person would be also irritated with what I've gone through I played four straight hours of just the most frustrated rocketing so you can't blame me for being human I'm not really really good with that stuff like I never really get upset but this stuff has a special power so Lysander does a very very special power and why does this guy seem like he's not going for the boss so we control this see the blocks huge nice nju shot let's get if you hit that you need a lead you just to random for my liking right please close no one ever passes that I feel like outside of well me when I was in deceitfully you only see passes watching this there's reason why it's really bad is no one trust each other don't pass this to each other you gotta have to do it in a way because no one knows headed the ball see you higher and higher in ranks weird higher the rank the less of a chance people will hit the ball makes no sense cuz they have a Mars blitz or bad I think I couldn't shoot but just kept it in you need hard to save to miss not back yet let's just side follow nice nice okay yo please let's just win human I'm so done I'm so done I can't I'm gonna be the happiest man alive when I can just say goodbye to the series forever I hope you guys still learned a decent amount of stuff from it though ragazza bout knowing it got at the end I shoulda done this way really it's got dragged down way too huh I didn't want it to be there I wanted to be quick see no it's not as fun for you guys if I just try to eat everyone that I'm playing in so obviously but really be fully fair to the lower ranked players of course nice I don't have any [ __ ] sauce you gotta control it's returning here that we had to beat approach we wouldn't have done we're gonna burn up the oneness without scoring it would have just continue the streak so I'm glad we chose to do we did go for it again back I already do is not good counter Tecton you a little time the video of lifts are the double flip reset actually don't get the second flip should be game though I'm gonna say although you pack you well there's definitely someone capable of keeping that ball up I'm gonna keep it up for one more goal okay we're done I think we're done forever with solo standard we can finally get happily happily back to the beautiful beautiful pro gameplay with proper tips against other pro players see me as many tips as possible there we go what we've been waiting for this whole time we finally got it done that we did cheat for two games two games out of the whole series be heated for and honestly I can't be upset about that were literally 1 MMR away from grant shame literally won and the game didn't give it to us like I'm so sad why could me it was gonna be a hard game to win to the one that we were one MMR away from so is what it is we're so close friend as close as we we got was one hmmm our off can't complain too much about that but hope you guys enjoyed this series which I started to eventually hate and I can't be happy that it's done but yeah we got some nice girls at least in the last video I promise you though my mood will be so much better in the next video guys I recorded the last five or six videos in a row so if I'm irritated in like the second one I'm probably irritated in videos 3 through 6 as well up to this one so that's why I probably sound the same way throughout all of these just because there's so many times we could've literally finished this and I don't enjoy not being able to score so many chances I hate just like seeing me miss or hate not being able to score myself so I didn't like the idea of the series that much in that sense I like that I could give you guys tips anyway we got ourselves two grand champ and all three of these players before the season ended I'm gonna leave the next row two grand champ that tryhard road of grand champ series I'm gonna leave a little bit of a break for like a month break before the next row two grand champ and whenever you guys want to see that like I really see a lot of love for it and then I'll start it up but we'll get back into our regular just pro gameplay chillin maybe some soloqueue grand champ to like high grand champs you guys can learn his block you guys all got a lot for my grand champs little cuties seriously and I'll give you guys my old tips that I used to give ya anyway hope you guys enjoy the series like I said I apologize for being a little bit of a party pooper the last few years been it's been tough to keep a good mental attitude these games can't lie to you chum absolute best of I promise I'll be I'll be back to normal and the next ones but this is what we ended off on we're at eighty eight point eight one percent which is not bad at all considering couldn't score for all those games except two but yeah hey I hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or never time is when
