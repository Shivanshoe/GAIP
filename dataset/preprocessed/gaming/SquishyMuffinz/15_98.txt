yo what's up guys as you guys know i'm going for top five in all three leaderboards at least i'm in for top five we can get top one obviously that's just icing on the cake but uh right now we're 80th and ones we're currently 80th in twos but we're just under the threshold of top 100 and 3v3 so i'm trying to raise all them at the exact same time um like trying to push them all up at the same time together it's going to take a while obviously like this but it's pretty much the same thing it's just going to be you know less variety if i do like one mode at a time so i'm trying to like kind of just cue whatever and whatever we get we'll play um so i'm gonna cue all three modes doesn't really matter too much and we'll see what we get and the main goal is just try to win obviously and see if we can raise our ranks up like i said we're 83rd in twos right now we're 71st and ones we're not even ranked in ones we're already sso um that's just how it worked this didn't reset the the points uh that much i'm pretty sure from last season it's like a software you said you lose like 80 mmr like 30 mmr off of top 100 in this and like 30 mmr and this are already top 30 um so we're not far off of a lot of stuff to be honest and even in 1v1 if i win like 311 games i'm ready top 30 in that as well so uh yeah whatever we get hopefully we can win let's get into us even get some dubs let's see how it goes [Music] i'm surprised after a pretty long queue we actually got a 3-3 game to start off this video for the first game so that's good that's the only mode that we're not in top 100 right now so winning this would be massive that's going to be a sweaty game for sure as 3v3 almost always is when you're solo queuing i kind of missed a little standard i don't know how you guys feel about this but i feel like ever since they removed it i've actually wanted to play it a lot which is weird it's a weird thing because when it was around i actually never wanted to play it but ever since i removed it i missed the fact that you could play a mode where everything's 100 solo because i think um the solo game that i had this season in 3v3 i noticed that a lot of people are queued up and i'm solo queueing into a full like pro team of 3q right which is really hard to win when you're solo queue you might not even have a pro in your team so i think that's like a a good thing about that also standard mode is that you're guaranteed to have a pretty fair lobby for the most part it's not going to be like extremely difficult to win if you're solo i know a lot of people had complaints about it back then here you see what you guys think though about that if not that it's gone if you guys missed having that around play my boost here sorry on the walk please gonna go up the wall so i get this challenge after his first touch should be a good shooting opportunity good save i try to wait for the very last moment to take the shot there it's the right play good pass for my teammate as well did you have not to rush the shot though like not to double jump too quick to it took my time placed it really well very hard for them to get a save on something like that you go quick to this i honestly didn't even see him i'm not gonna lie i was actually really tunnel vision on the ball and i had no idea someone was up for that he was like kind of like blending in with the the background like the scenery of the map i wonder if that'll show up on video how i saw it if i watched that back after see it save i'm gonna beat me to that but it's fine trying to just bait the touch but driving up it's forced him to get a bad hit something that he wouldn't be too happy with try to delay the shot again it's a good idea should i maybe try to play a little bit softer i went too fast on that i'll touch there it's a good hit though take the boost from his teammate who's going to be young for that one my teammates should challenge this if not it might be tough played to open space on the left click the boost take his back boost as well let me get a lot of pressure on this guy gotta get some boost should i get on a good spot in defense if i could get the demo right there have been huge there's trying to be like a nuisance off the ball is really important in spots like that i think [Music] there we go that's a little soft shot on net enough to secure the goal yeah all he could do because on the left side of the ball there obviously has hit it across so i'm going to pre position on the right like a simple simple detail that helps a lot noticing like where people can hit the ball this guy's coming from the left he's obviously gonna have to hit it to the right so it's a very small thing but if you're pre-positioning on the right spot it's gonna help you a lot on itself gotta wait right here i'm lucky if if my teammate was able to to spot the the attacker was there like that close he could have maybe passed it to me would have been a goal potentially but obviously a lot harder to do than what it seems gets to spot the guy and get the perfect touch to me for it to be a goal right not easy by any means good booster trying to get on my teammates way now he's a past middle i like that he fake sex it was kind of obvious [Music] to touch here the demo trying to get a software such second kind of like get multiple hits on chop to the corner good job one more touch leave my teammate now say my boost as well which is really good about that nice good play good play click our time again create a lot of space in that corner just by taking a really soft first touch to myself that i can again get a lot of touches on so that's really good way to utilize the space that they're kind of giving me in that situation but yeah we played really well good first game for sure um got a lot of goals in that game actually four goals i didn't even realize i got them in the polls but against the next game to even keep it up we gotta get out of portion now we got like 10 points so we're actually two wins of 10 points away from top 103 so we top 100 in all three game ones already this early in the season that's pretty good so yeah against the next game so you can keep it up get another win let's see how it goes all right for last game we got ourselves a 2b2 we got sauce against block and almighty stew i actually don't recognize anyone in this lobby i'm not gonna lie so i'm not sure what to expect we'll see you there i got my team left that boost that's the right play there you just want to kick off so better for him to go back it's gonna be in a much better position like he is right now because he just went back off that diving about leaving that solo play for me necessarily just more about the position it'll leave him in after the fact if he leaves that boost right actually i like that bump attempts from the opponent smart there one of the few ways you can actually create pressure that situation wait for him to jump here try to hit it over him this should be good now it's a lot of pressure created just by that one touch right so i get it over the first guy i know that the first guy is just challenging for his teammate right so getting it over him is still the goal there because i don't want to just have that be a 50 and the first guy's challenged be useful so if i can get it over him there that's i would say that's a victory i'm going to bump this guy i'd just be annoying force his path to be bad back to net but not always any of my resources as well should have one more touch here place my corner now there's no more option forward there so as soon as he is out of boost i just take advantage of that on two of them when i try to block the first guy but second guy was the one that actually made contact it seems like a kind of tough spot he shot a ball to be honest the opponent shot it well like he didn't give him an easy save there [Music] i'm thinking what he could have done different but i made a mistake back there too i shouldn't i tried like past that i was going for like a soul play out better solo it out [Music] almost a really good play from them for the block should be 1v1 now good for my teammate to take time here very smart close let's say from there i'll go quick for this one now so i control it though it's a 50 should be okay he makes up early so i gotta be careful here if he gets beat i don't know how he got such a good touch on that just bump them keep the ball in their corner got to be careful here i don't know if i can get back i might have forced them wide enough i think i did you got this mid boost too which is good take a shot of course i hit it back to my teammate he's also gonna have no choice but to hit it back which is really good i don't really want to fall this one i think i'm gonna fake this he's gonna be close yet ended up working just take a shot see what happens i don't mind throwing shots like that on net i feel like as long as you make them jump as long as you waste the resources like slowly it's gonna be good most of the time it's been in some awkward spots we're doing well to get out of it playing patiently he may should take his time here a lot of space but he didn't get a bad touch too bad hopefully he helps you out again here if not if he's going back then i'll just challenge get around this guy i'm gonna get a shut up shot of that but i'm just trying to beat him they play from him just hit it around my teammates smart can't really challenge me it's back hold up should be okay take my time you're trying to play right wall here you won't expect that i'm going to bump this guy all right timo's a little bit close i don't like in twos to keep up that close i know you're trying to be like in support for me but that's the problem that comes with that right we ended up getting scored on because we have to rush back put this in a very like dangerous situation after the fact so if you're positioning that's like a very hard thing to to get good at i think is positioning in a spot where you're covering like the potential good option and the bad option i think that's something that a lot of people are good at so kind of where i was just sitting was like the best spot to be in i think in the situations where you can follow up on absolutely everything so he got the solo play that ended up where it did right but if i was too close i wouldn't be able to follow that up at all if i was even further back i wouldn't be able to follow it up at all so it's a very hard thing to find a middle ground on and no one's perfect with that at all um it's one of like easiest mistakes to make i think like things that happen the most let's try to fit through this again go back now i'll have full boost that's something you you got to just watch your replays back most likely and that's the best way to work on that i think try to work on your your positioning like how spread out you are like look at him again he's a little bit too pushed up and now you see how much harder the next situation is for him to deal with that's something that you gotta place yourself in a really good spot to do with every option at all times which is hard very hard thing we have demos i'm trying to play this a little bit quicker there's one right behind me had i known that i had more space probably a goal straight up because i have a lot of time i don't go in there not a very hard situation to score good job my team see that's a really good position to be in where he was right there you see he gets pre-possession now he has this opportunity that's created off of that try to block his touch he didn't actually make contact i'll pop this my teammate decent opportunity got this mid boost you may should go for me nice awkward situation because he was still fully in possession of the ball there and i have a lot of time so i try to place the right wall i think it's really a play to make most of the time people are challenging like this because i still have keep control no matter what look how much pressure it puts on them right i didn't have to do anything really but the thing is if i push it to the right wall i can just go for these two bumps like i did right i go for both those bumps they both are in the spot where if they say where the balls paddling is they get bumped if not like they just did like they try to dodge me they're going to be in a very bad spot they can't even stay with the ball so i thought it's kind of a p to be honest i'm gonna wait patiently here again i don't want to throw this game we have one go lead it's not back yet it's i'm gonna fix it on early gotta make him throw this way early it should be fine now he's missed behind me that's the best way to play that again i know i have my teammate there i'm not going to rush too early or my teammate can't help me out i'm paying attention to when he's behind me as soon as he's behind me the early challenge comes in makes him hit it over me it doesn't matter if it gets over me it's not 1v1 if it's 1v1 i'm not playing that situation like that of course you can't uh but yeah good games for today guys i hope you enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever
