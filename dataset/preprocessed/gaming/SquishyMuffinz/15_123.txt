yo what's up guys good to play except 2b2 games for today with garrett should be seeing the games let's get it to let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves against brendan and kwop we're also almost top 10 i believe right now or 25th something like that so if we get some dubs here we'll be in prime position to get uh pretty high top ten which is always good it's always good oh one for the top bennies on the shot actually really close attempt there took my time see where it bounced because i didn't want to go a little bit too quick to that ball and miss right i know i had time he beat the last guy for a while there of course the crossbar might hit his head left right here see if he's ready for it he is took my time while there gary's probably a little bit confused to be honest i made it look weird but if it confuses garrett it probably confuses them too which is a good thing right through the wall here let him panic a bit he's gonna have to hit this away it's fine should we gear its ball now i say done can get this mid boost put his back to me play number one go back down to the ground try to play it over the second guy he didn't end up jumping but it still might work crossbar crossbar from gear got it still wait for the touch off the wall fine it should be garrett's ball here to begin i stay done played dude slamming the slam in the crossbar this game but didn't start sliding for sure only a matter of time right the good thing is we're getting the chances it's a good thing it's a bad kick off for me leaves him in a bad situation could have done it better should i put it to the corner take the boost see what gear does he has a challenge that's fine kind of messed up my area a little bit there but it's okay should still work out fine i'm not going to go for this ball he's going to be up for it already get safe from us should be fine once be gonna go so i kind of went early there i didn't need to oh my he almost doubled that could have been really bad let him panic touch that oh sorry garrett all right we're fine i played off the gear side i couldn't really shoot hoping i could pass through him there game's a little bit messy so far but it's fine i'm gonna bait this out forget it hopefully try to bump him now nice gets the ball cleanly to garrett now he's a 1v1 should be fine he's gonna block to the side i don't really have a shot on that and i can jump at him just to bait it out a bit it's gonna be too hard to figure out to deal with play down to him for a shot actually smart play just hit it around might be in yeah let me shout out well that's my bad i didn't have faith in him to get the second touch i'm not gonna lie should be fine played off to the side here gonna drive into that at least getting to know everyone now should be a really good position for him to do something off this let him turn on this it's fine he's got our weight on this touch here when his flip i actually really get control from him that's a good job there gotta wait for his touch don't know if i was able to score it or not not sure no i missed my bet i misread it went so much higher than i thought first game of the day first game of the day gotta give me a little bit of slack here call me some slack oops wanna get right there should be fine actually it might work out nice good job from here it's all about adapting right it might not be the cleanest stuff at first it's all about how you adapt and improvise it's a game of improvisation it really is it comes down to how you play every little situation how you react to the things that happen really is very reactionary these days more than ever the ability to react to what's happening on the field is so important pass to the right here he's got a loan that's fine oh i didn't think it was a pass at the end let me go for a shot see if i can slot it it's a good block should be your goal here good save from there well done all right first touch away there for the bounce now a really good bang now i can bait this out i'm just going to pressure it make him hit good enough for me should be good for garrett to win maybe hit across here oh no not like this not like this i slam the crossbar i send the crossbar two seconds you can do it i've seen us do this before all right i'm trolling this game a little bit well not awfully but he wants the fake okay oh he wanted the spanish sorry i forgot about the spanish strat i cannot reach the ball holy crap and i'm just going i'm just going for every ball but i can't even reach him i'm definitely trolling this one no i messed up i got the boost remember that's big big boost steel bumped them off as well all right we're gonna win this though i could see it i could see it making this one making a panic see what he does leaving to forget which is good all right i can't really go all in on this guy should go for me 1v1 now this is the garrett's prime situation he goes off when it matters here yes sir i'm back i was i was throwing that game i was throwing that game on it's a high five that was throwing that game i could have done a lot better but it's okay we got the dub that's what matters at the end of the day we got the dub and that's all that matters against the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs here yeah guys all right for last game we got ourselves against fifi and ridoko we got sweaty one here to finish it off can we do it should i put this off to the left i don't think you expected it eventually you did expect it this guy's crazy going for these pre-flips and stuff these pre-jumps man these guys are crazy ahead of the head of the meta wow you almost missed how does he almost missed i was rolling in front of that i'm bad at empty nets but that was i was scary that was i don't know if i would have done that all right let's wait for the ball here get my time for one he's gonna go right away that's fine we end up winning this yo gets a good touch here this uh sequence still in our favor i'd say can't really do much here you're going to play it to the wall and to me my garrett take it away close there we go i didn't expect the power on the shot there there's gonna be so strong this is messy he's actually in the post so many times right we gotta deal with this 1v1 for a moment different flip oh i'm sad he just turns i could have beat him there for sure i thought i was surprised he turned that's that's stuff that always gets me when i can for sure beat the person that ends up going and we're going for the ball like that's what makes it work right this element of surprise it's like not smart but at the same time it's smart because it shouldn't work you know we shouldn't expect it i should have shot on the empty that i don't know why i passed i stuck your head boost i wanted i wanted the banger for the status satisfaction wow wow wow wow wow nothing is working nothing is working our way in the 50s fun we have three minutes wow there's just nothing nothing's going away it's fine though it's fine though insane level of confidence from the other team here i'm lost wow i didn't know i didn't know what that meant not gonna lie there was so many quick chats at once was not ready all right we can come back though two minutes left a lot of time then eternity in this game mode you guys do want it badly though you could tell so we're gonna need to go off here i hit it so hard should have tapped it over him would have worked set a pre-jump here nice i should slot this potentially two of them went which is good for us can't really beat them to this i kind of can about sit there huge come back hundred percent yes sir dirty boost double tap they come back here i'm just trying to bump him i should have this nice plank out of his way and i say that's big big one all right he's gonna have a bang here that's fine there just hit away the ball nice he should be there but it's okay see he does a little bit of panic there didn't have to jump so early it's gonna be good for us now for a little bit i better get something out of this sorry about the background noise by the way guys i don't know what's going on upstairs very loud even for me get off the water myself there we go here we go we got it 40 seconds we're back back in yes sir we're crazy we're crazy so laggy i was like 50 50 wise like almost nothing was going our way the beginning of the game that's why i felt like we're always in it right i didn't feel like we're getting like crazy out played or anything those are the games you can't come back from the games where like things just don't feel like they're going going your way or definitely ones you can come back from so never felt like we're out of this one he wins this ball this big here we go oh i thought it was in not gonna lie i tried to steal it fine 18 seconds just gotta kill time now i'll take a low shot see what he does he has to save it high big challenge here make him hit it away big challenge again make a panic yes sir all you gotta do is all you gotta do little little baits get them to hit the ball away it works like a charm looks like a tram all
