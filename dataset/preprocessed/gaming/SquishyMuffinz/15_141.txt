[Music] yo what's up guys gonna be solo queueing some twos for today it should be some good games gonna be really sweaty because i'm super high on mar get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a sweaty game started off we got brandon and omar here we have dapper on our team say this goes i put a mid boost i got it bumped off the ball as well which is big wind there as well i'm gonna rotate behind dapper and twos a lot of time yeah i think of it like you would threes in a way like but the situation is always that if you're first man you're really second man and if you're third man it's also third man but in this second man um the way i think about it is like try to play as safe as you possibly can if your last back wait for your teammate to get behind you if you're first men also the same situation in a way try to play the ball in a spot where your team is going to have an easy hit on it and not going to be in a situation it's like a challenge good follow job from dapper but yeah think of it in that way like same way you'd play second man in 3v3 to be safe it's the same way you want to play 2v2 but all the time it's the best way to think about it unlucky on the bump there good speed from dapper hold on i hope that makes sense though that's like kind of the key to high level 2v2 is playing smart when you're in that position same thing the high level throughput to be honest when you're not second man roll you don't want to over aggress and leave your third man in a really bad situation you make one mistake as first man in 2v2 which again is really second man in 3v3 um they need to leave your last man back in a 1-2 situation with a lot to work with so don't overstay like i just did right there that's a little bit of overstaying but i know i can still get back that's why i did it i'm gonna get bumped it up i should have placed up to the wall play back by myself now all you could do is play that ball into me put it over i'm just going to lay there play a lot and now i can oversee a little bit get their boost because he has no way out for a second tough spot to be in here most of that cover didn't have much of an option played it pretty well i'm going to get bumped here most likely all right very good i think i had most of that covered again still a really awkward situation to be in that press another 1v1 here nice well done from that there were they well played all i have to do there is wait patiently because again if that ball gets slammed off that preset i don't want to be in a bad position i want to be in a spot where i can help him get back i can kill time for him to get back the patience from us on that good try from that bear i was good patience on the back wall originally to not get you know a little bit too antsy and free jump good shot from them dapper probably could have had it if you waited an extra second before jumping i think he was just in a weird situation maybe didn't think he could reach it maybe double here i shouldn't have went again there that was the risky challenge i should have went for dapper should go for me that's fun and grab his boost not gonna be in either no big deal flake jump here should be easy for that bump the last man pass back to dapper play it off back oh dapper shouldn't go yeah smart martha back off he has to play this this ball ball though he does touch from us back there gotta block him there we go they play from us good sequence can we back right boost here let me know guys if you want to see me do a road to super super super super super super super super super sunny legend by the way i haven't actually done one yet but i'm totally down to do one it's been a while since i did uh i rode the grand champ series at all so 100 down to doing but it's up to you guys and you have to let me know what game mode you guys want to see it in i don't mind doing whatever any of the game modes are fine with me i know a lot of you guys like ones and i haven't really played a lot of ones on a channel so maybe you'd want a one of you on one imagine i got the perfect flick out of that go for a bump here they're kind of on each other's butt gonna force a touch from dapper he might not have wanted though as well played from them and a good spot to follow this up hit it around them open space the name of the game again open space gonna be hard for him to get a really good hit on that he has to go himself rotate behind dapper here worst case scenario gets over it might have it tell the rotation should always be nice and clean you have everything covered no big gaps in it so right here again i'm waiting for dapper to get back i'm going to fake dapper's behind me now and now's my chance to try the challenge for him and they have no attack on that there's no approach that they can have that'll be dangerous there because we waited that's what i was trying to say earlier i'm waiting to get behind me again before i rush the display and now no matter what i do it doesn't really matter because we're in a good position and he's gonna be behind me so i don't need to force to go out of that a little bit awkward here because i thought the apple would turn but that was still good because he waited for me unlucky unlucky unlucky 19 seconds one goal lead he's got to play smart in our hands here we make the mistake they deserve it good win that's a huge one because they probably turned middle hoping for the best on that and i'm gonna play this back this is the smartest thing to do in a situation that they should leave for me there we go they have no option i can fake the big hit person that hit it across there we go that's well played smartly played at the end there good first game for sure like i said let me know down below if you want to see me do a road to super sonic legend and ones twos threes doesn't matter i'm totally down to do one it's fun for me to do it's very educational as well for you guys especially if i do it the right way so let me know down below you guys want to see totally down and do whatever even other video ideas you guys have for me let me know i'm totally down to do whatever guys get the next one stephen keep it up get back-to-back dubs for today that's a uh good window we got 10 points out of that i'm pretty sure so here we are on the leaderboard after that one 24th at 22 54. i haven't really been playing a crazy amount too i'm playing more threes than twos we're at 2209 top 10 and threes i haven't played like any ones there at all so i should probably be playing more once but yeah let's get into the next game stephen keep it up get back to big dubs see you guys all right we got a good game to end off on here we got lion blades against coquita and duck is going to be sweaty as well there's one of those instantly found lobbies i should know when as well might be tough for the lion blaze all right gonna play it forward even if he's not close it's fine i wasn't sure of it so better safe than sorry constitution finale i'm just gonna pee there i was kind of just trolling going up for the hope that maybe i can get something out of it you shot him well played i've had to do much so far just clear the danger those are the best kind of games better flip i think it would fake him maybe i would have been able to score that if it got under him it's a good attempt seems like he's going so i let him have is a once player so i'm going to let him have as many opportunities as possible i don't mind leaving the ball i'm not selfish i'm not someone who's gonna try to cut you off for free points i don't care for that stuff i'm here for the win all right three goals one minute i really hope they don't forfeit i think they can come back here we just had some really good kickoff to start pick ups are a huge part of twos as well on top of everything i mentioned in the last game kickoffs are massive as well you can master getting possession on kickoff and twos is just as good as mastering in ones threes as well it's underrated to have a good kick off super underrated good beat from us going to give lion blaze a lot of space for it now got a fake challenge something i mentioned last game trying to get the ball out of his possession without actually throwing up my position that there really well can't shoot perfectly but it's gonna be enough to force a bad touch so we still technically have pressure here even though they have the ball blind baby's gonna win this next touch ever almost every time kind of get bumped played around them very good play there there we go good shot from us thank you i was gonna play originally before the flip reset i just think getting around it there is a lot better than trying to go for an early shot panicking a little bit saving boost and getting into a good position to pull off something like that is much better play it to the corner he's in nice and soft playing it back to me well played can't get a perfect shot but it's going to be awkward for him i could play this left for limeblaze because he'll probably be there sorry a little bit behind him i didn't lead him on should be back in time i'll play so for those passages you always try to lead on where your your teammate is so they're a little bit behind the ball always try to aim in front of them that's going to be the best way to convert those and actually get goals out of them if you have a background in soccer or football you'll know what i mean by that perfect pass is always one that's ahead of the player you want to get it to almost always the through balls are the ones that make the big difference obviously direct passes are okay sometimes but we're trying to get a shot of it leading someone on for a more powerful shot is always the best way to do it i respect these guys for sticking out the game so far try pass it off to the left trying to lead them on like i was talking about a little bit ahead of him you can actually get a lot of power on the shot and has a lot more options so always try to aim ahead of the player you want to get it to straight to the person is almost never better for them trying to shoot i think it's never better for them trying to shoot unless you're rolling it directly at them then they can get more powered a bit but high and straight at somebody is very hard to get good power on i always try to lead them on but yeah very good two games today guys i can't play another one i actually got to get off it's really late right now it's already 3 am i'm very tired but i hope you guys enjoyed and like i
