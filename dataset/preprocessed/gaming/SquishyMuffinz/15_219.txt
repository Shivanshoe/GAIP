getting closer and closer every day and it's thanks to you guys so thank you so much enjoy today's video love you yo what's up guys gonna be playing some more twos today with gimmick we played the last two videos with them i think we've been showing trying to record videos for the weeks i am going to be a little bit busy this week with rlcs stuff and practicing and stuff like that so i'm trying to get as many videos out to you guys as possible for the week and maintain my upload schedule so let's get into the games for today should be some bangers there's a lot of good players on right now so see how it goes all right playing all right the first game we're playing the same guys that we played in the last video which is expected i'm queuing around the same time seeing the last one so it's about like 5-10 minutes later surprised they're still queuing though because they've been on for a while these guys they're grinding trying to fake this there we go that's a good play there i could have used gimmick and the fact that he was middle is actually good in a way because you know they have to kind of worry about that pass option right they have to cover so many more things good spot from gimmick you spotted up the the mistake on the kickoff there i mean it's a free goal right but if you're not paying attention you catch yourself you know sleeping a little bit on kickoff you're not going to catch the empty net there you're just going to hit it normally so that's good from gimmick to be ready be aware looks easier than it is to spot out when someone's a little late to kick off like that wait for him to go here i'm gonna bait it i told him to give me the ball for free i'll see a demo good demo back from gimmick the instant trade nice 50. i defend the booster come back already i was hoping he would jump and it would go a little bit more to gimmick but actually works he's going to play the patient it's fine it's a pinch from us i'm gonna bait this i want him to go quick okay now it's a little risky because i went that's fine it worked out they they ended up both killing each other which kind of made it scary at the end there but it's okay i know he's behind me there i don't need to panic too much let him hit it off the wall let him take it i should have left that honestly as a pass it was it was good from gimme to go for that i should have been in a better position though should just pre-position right away it's fine if he hits it no big deal i'm not even bothering jumping for a lot of these so i know there's not a lot of danger that's fine should be okay if can we get the next touch ah still okay i was gonna be from the now to be there nice gotta wait for his boom back here pass up the gimmick he has time now in the air you want to give all the players these days time with the ball in there that's like best case scenario all the mechanical players i actually got back there i don't know how but i did wasn't expecting to reach it but that's the only way i could have and it worked so we'll take it and we gotta go out of it wow the classic c9 bro should we got scored on instead we get to go out of it and they just forfeited i would four for two after that to be honest i would so i don't blame them but good first game might have to play two more for this video because that was a little bit quicker than i wanted to be but let's get into the next one see if we can get another win let's see how it goes all right playing is the same guys i'm surprised you're still cueing these guys are grinders man got mid right try to hit around him should have been a goal almost almost faked him it's going for the boost off i beat him to that would have been huge i'm gonna leave this i'm gonna do this hopefully gimmick knows you didn't know you read me like a book ah slightly messing up my control on those for some reason not exactly what i want every time that's fine there's no danger in me just sitting there like that because if i kill this guy mid they don't have an option anymore either way i get back to that ball if i didn't jump that's that's unlucky though because i was in a bad spot for that that's something that you can't get back to if that challenge is one that hard so i have to be in a better position to be there for worst-case scenario there we go what i do for those sheets i just hold on to all my boost i try to position a little bit slower behind the ball i don't i don't try to cheat up as quick as possible because you have more momentum more speed coming into the ball you can get a better um a better shot off of it if you save your boost at the end there instead of just wasting all your boost and not having enough at the end that's two of them fifteen good pre-flip from him you make stole the boost wall i can't go for this quite yet he's closer on the back wall already i'm gonna have one more oops on me pass back oh my god perfect i should've went for the demo probably in hindsight having a pass option there isn't that useful it's a good fake for him but at the same time it gives my teammate the ball so i don't really mind that i don't mind getting faked in a spot like that if it does end up resulting in a positive thing nice from kim nice job you know i wasn't going to try to shoot i was just trying to fake that for him make him think i was going to go for the shot and just drop it down i know intent of actually using my flip reset there we just try to hit the ball down the bottom of my car good job from him to go back recognize the situation i have time here i know i have time so i'm just gonna use it nice just one guy back now there we go the play to break out there all came from just slowing down the play that was a really good job from both of us take the pads here try to cheat that's fine i can go back now ah shouldn't have got beat there at least shouldn't have lost the 50. good patience from kim nice pass from gimmick good good troll from us though he did it we did a really good job there to get it over him another early forfeit from them good game all around we played that really well i think for the most part the only goal was that one challenge they had off gimmicks for preset but outside of that we had pressure the entire time played really well so let's get into the third game of today's video that'll be the last one hopefully we can get the back to back to back wins we've not lost yet i mean you're making this to sesh the universe open champions are still on top seems good seems good all right let's get into the next one get some more dopes all right now we got the super super super super sweaty lobby arsenal and aj arsenal's the first person to reach 2500 mmr and twos this season so this guy plays a lot of twos he loves his 2v2 so not gonna be easy whatsoever aj plays a lot of twos as well he's got good mechanics which is all you need for tues these days honestly bump them there good patience from gimmick let's be a good one to end off the video though if we do get the win if we lose two doesn't matter i mean they're both very good players i just flipped away on me it's a goal accidentally flipped onto their side so i can't recover and get back for that man they play like pretty much exactly everything i've been saying lately when i play twos for youtube they just try to control every single ball same thing every pro player is the same in twos these days can't pass as much as you used to be able to it's the one thing i definitely don't like as much really smart fake from gimmick the classic good on him to trust me to win that challenge too he was really close there wait for aj bumps from him that's fine spitting out the ball get back right boost nice from kim he's gonna be there first it's fine i'm trying to bail out the ball situation's not bad for us good touch for gimmick good job from him to follow that up right away too like take the initiative to actually do that a lot of players would just wait there in that spot that's the spot to be in he gets back to be huge nice try to just launch one not a bad clear gimmick's gonna have that got some pads here moving forward they're trying to shot i don't want to go quite yet for this game it's not back yet i don't really have help so i got to just go aj was going for the bump that's what made that situation really hard to deal with nice faking it's fine arsenal always goes for for ball control first which is smart that's always this play though he'll almost never throw it away especially in twos and threes he does sometimes because you kind of have two in threes but he'll almost never throw it away he doesn't have to all right we take this honestly a little bit lucky won't lie to you had a bit lucky but good patch can give me hopefully arsenal's just partied with someone i wonder if it's aj good save i'm gonna take the boost try to leave here not bad if i can hit off the back wall again i'm gonna clear some danger for a bit good challenge from gim no fear i kind of threw okay you missed we're good one for the past one for the pax for the boys classic c9 play pass over shoot even if it's empty he's gonna be there challenge dribble right away there we go that's the confidence so we like to see no fear all right good games hope you guys enjoyed that was a good dub at the end there like i said arsenal's the first player to reach 2500 mm right now he is top five on the leaderboard i'm pretty sure that's theory is actually see where we were playing against here mmr wise i know he was 2500 mmr for a while i don't think he is anymore arsenal personnel 2351 so he was up there for a while he actually got a smurf to 2400 mmr as well so he had two accounts up to 2400 and 2500 um so yeah he's a grinder when it comes to two he's a very good two's player so that's a good win for sure um but yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
