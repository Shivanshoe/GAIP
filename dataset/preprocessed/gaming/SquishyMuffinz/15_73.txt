yo what's up guys we're playing some threes today with gimmick and mile told you guys in the last video we'll find the third we ended up playing against mile and uh in a game and we had musty on our team we're trying to record some games with musty but we only got one game in and then he ended up leaving so we couldn't actually do we ended up losing as well um muscle wasn't having a good time we got dunked straight into our net twice or three times in the same game so i think he just got off took a break for the day but uh yeah we got mile from the game that we had with musty so he ended up joining us um yeah let's get into it if you can get some dubs see how it goes all right so we got a very very sweaty uh game here make this toasty one to my very interesting i'll take my time here on the solo good dunk i should have that pretty easily to the side gonna be a fun game though it's pretty much a full it is a full pro team auction plays pretty well in rlcs last season wonder mike i think he's like teammates with kernoby now like this and for novi yeah pretty solid roster might take an extra second there maybe it's horrible but it's tough i couldn't quite get a shot of it because it ended up bouncing a little bit behind me but it's so hard to like perfectly place that in a situation not a bad touch for a mile there just gonna wait for his control here in one day fine it's a good challenge good job to take our time there because you don't want to insta-rush that and give them a free if we hit away right it's fine oh the skin would have been crazy there's a touch you can get with just like the tip of your your car like underneath your car where the wheels are at that just skims the ball that's what i was going for there really close our mouths have jumped quick i was probably going to be in a bad spot i'll go no one was able to get a touch on there because again if model doesn't go right here or at least try to force him it becomes really awkward right and then now gimmick you gotta think of it from gimme's perspective the ball is above his head right you can't see anything that's coming toward you so you don't know if someone's up for it or not so it becomes really hard that situation all right we're going for a bunch of demos all good very interesting can actually touch on that i could turn here and it was just a little bit too awkward yeah i'm going to thank you for a bunch of demos like this honestly like it's not that threatening you just got to find a way to like connect passes often because if they're going for demos like that they're gonna be like disjointed for sure there's gonna be like a gap between them so you gotta find that gap to try to play around it gotta bump on them nice job yeah the goals are always going to be messy in a game like this when all three players are going for like aggressive demos and stuff on their team it's not a pretty way to play the game i don't enjoy it but tomosu will play it in in rank for some reason they love that demo heavy strategy nice should have got the bump into my thing yeah i was definitely on lucky mouth missed empty net all good it's definitely worth going for the bump there like i did that was the best best player i could have made for sure it's actually got us a goal but it's a little bit off on the shot one more touch here which way nice block that covering all the options right if i just sit on the wall there i covered so much and then the the flip there to get the extra touch is really good [Music] ended up bringing it back she got to watch out for the demos again one of the mic aggressively off the kickoff demo in there it's fine [Music] should be okay here if i just get to touch it's fine for some white at least burst them into a spot where they're not gonna have a shot directly off the path which is always a good situation i'd say ah wow you just missed okay this is like a super bump heavy game he had a free shot he goes for double misses it gets the bump on me when i would have the read and then my team's just not ready that's like very ugly uh looking goals because of all the bumps and like physical play involved i'm quite used to this though because again even in like pro play like teams like ssg all they do is like super aggressive bumps like this so if you learn how to play against it against one team you're gonna be pretty fine almost got the double there it's almost perfect there's one guy back left to beat the touch off the back wall was enough to beat him there we go gotta go there but yeah we're very used to playing teams that like are super aggressive and bumping a lot so it's not super out of the ordinary it's just a little bit annoying when it's ranked because like obviously in tournaments you're doing anything you can for the win and ranked i don't know it should be more for practice in my opinion so i just don't like my teams either that much but sorry we're getting to practice whatever way they want to off the wall should be open nicely done you make trusted me to get it around them good job to be there you touch off the wall there around one and then another good touch off the wall i'm the last guy that could possibly get in the way of that play put some pads here had one take the boost though you touch my mouth should get the touch ah i'm lucky i mean it's hard because from mile's perspective he probably thinks he can beat him no you should he probably should have been able to see that he couldn't but it's tough still either way it's one of those situations where like you have to make the call like last second right am i gonna be able to beat him here or not and then you already start going and it's too late like your decision's already made at that point should be dead here anyway we're gonna have a hard time keeping this up for a shot nicely done all right get into the next game so you can keep it up get back that would probably be the same guys honestly it's the highest rank guys on pretty much it is a full pro team it's almost the entire kcp roster let's see if we can do it again yep same team know what to expect gonna be a lot of bumps stuff like that if you go either way control from gimmick good challenges first here just baiting it or something when i say baiting it in my eyes i'm trying to make him either flick it high or i watch the low touch if he brings it low that's my my duty to watch that touch at that point the big whiff there from macnos i think it was like definitely to a goal but i think gimmick requested that he wouldn't miss it because it's pretty it's pretty unlikely a pretty good player misses that so it's hard for gimmick to just be ready for it right so i i think that a lot of like high level teams do is one player just plays the miss regardless so if it doesn't come through then it's whatever but if it if the miss does come through you get a free go out of it so it's worth just playing the mistake find another aggressive bump attempt some paths here look how like pushed up all their players are there just for a couple bumps it doesn't really do all that much it's not really worth it i'm not going to stay calm on the back wall here kind of get by all of them without really doing much they're done i'm going to bait this get a bump on them bump the other one as well be empty [Music] i think picking the times for your bumps rather than just always playing like full speed aggressive on the bumps is much better it's much better to actually have like a reason for every bumper you're going for instead of just always just zooming around the map for him it's a really hard thing to like get good at though and like always do at the right time i don't have my flip anymore i find my flip would have been fast enough for him to score for sure uh a little bit a little bit wide there i had to be the guy that was underneath me that's why that was difficult there's one guy underneath me trying to go for the guy that was back it's a good beat there jimmy can beat him be huge i should be back anyway [Music] sort of any boost you're just going to grab back boost and just chill i don't know if you should go for me first back wall posts let me get mid right boost here you may beat them it's huge try it's fine honestly it forces two here mal didn't commit actually smart of a mile not to commit there played off the back wall i can't actually get shot so i try to pass it back to mile did good to wait there play back corner doesn't allow the shot from wonder it's gonna be really awkward for both guys back then am i panicking with this not the best touch right off the wall that's fine i can actually get a shot out of that there's gonna be two guys back there really close to being a goal if i just get under one that's a goal [Music] nice it's any bump though are we good really good turn for a mile good job the patch from gimmick that's what really got us that goal there i think the passer in those situations really does not get the credit they deserve i feel like that's like what makes that play possible someone having the the presence of mine to actually look for the pass there is extremely valuable i think [Music] put off the wall again should be fine miles already up should be blocked i'm gonna fake the big hit here [Music] about both of those guys nice all right they only have 30 seconds left at this point we have to make like a pretty pretty big set of mistakes here for this to even be dangerous i think it's a good read on the back wall you just hold down defense we should be okay it's fun it's a little bit too fast for like even me to react to on the goal line there so yeah i had the whole net blocked all you could do is force it wide actually pretty good pass down but again we have everything blocked it's not a big deal that's from gimmick the double here good job a good set of games you played uh full pro team both games and pretty handily beat him i'd say pretty solid stuff cannot complain i didn't mean to queue again all right hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment and
