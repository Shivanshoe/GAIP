series I already know it's gonna be a good series all the way through so yeah let's get into the games for today we're currently had to a template who played to in the last week One Bowl and got a lot of cool goals like I said so hopefully we'll win the next two again and get a lot more cool goals for today I won't be doing coms with Justin for this one or the next two probably but after that we'll do a bunch of comms ones in a row so look forward to that and also like I said the last video all of these will be uploaded on justice channel from his POV as well so if you want to watch that over there definitely go give it a look and make sure you drop them a subscription while you're there as well oh yeah Sansa d games for today should be some good ones like I said let's get straight into it so I guess I have the first game fine against JD and Ruach I think is how you say it I feel like everyone at this rank when we're like unranked like this is low-key like nuts I don't know why I always get that feeling I don't even know how to past I was trying to get like a really good touch to Justin but it's fine I just hit it back try to pass over to him I passed them again nice it's Vegas some nutty passing place he just looked oh no straight up left the match shaky-shaky all right ladies all alone can he do it can he do the one be to you how I said won't be one all right Jessa can take it it's only fair it's only fair just gotta hit some nutters there gotta go for a double reset Oh we'll take turns and Justin scores I'll I try to do the 1v1 I'm gonna go for a double flip reset one Justin scores double O key fob coop all right well that's game one out the way we'll probably play two more games because that one was like super super quick but let's get to the next hopefully it'll be longer than that let's see her I guess hi hopefully this game last long we got John Wick's pencil and Shaq attack I should have that corner Bruce and I could just go off the ceiling oh my god I missed by a mile wait I'll try absolutely banging that how did I steal this wait my my wheels soul that oh my god I was like the best cool cylinder I had no idea I was getting at all I thought Justin did all the work day oh my my oh but this is the flip this flip got actually kind of cool though if you hit that on his foot I'm not gonna say what he said to check cuz that's gonna get this video then monetize and that's not fun for anyone but yeah he's not very happy that'll happen let's see oh I don't know why I tried the teeth that I was gonna try to land on the ceiling dude got that as a freestyle as a freestyle goal surely look at this view there's no idea I'm coming yeah that's awesome mind game you just said mind the body teammate comes in slams you a knit top corner we're gonna get a good one press it back that's the end again oh you cut it out too fast all right it's fun let's get a passing play going let's reset you let me say this the ball quick these guys are way too good they're all over it double-o don't feel flip flip reset double off the back I know what you guys want to call the other way but we're just gonna chill for the placements and then we'll we're go for the combs after most likely after the placement games are done these games are just chilling you [Music] oh I can't double oh my god you got that angle oh I'll try to read him off the backward pop it up for him [Music] double we gotta get something cool something really cool is him I have a feeling it's coming there it is a little back and forth that's not like some funny from their view I've no idea how do you even stop that like even if you're good how do you stop that it's hard hard to read what's happening is this you're never really gonna go for that against good players cuz you know they're gonna be a better position for it probably and cut it out before it happens we have a pretty good second game even though it was cut short but getting to the third and most likely last game of today's video and hopefully it's long the entire duration if we can get some really good goals let's get into all right putting against Kawasaki and split and they're cute together and they're in a clan called dad so I wonder if they're actually dads [Music] no I keep say okay I want to get a triple deed no I went for the triple just actually right there and got this deal hi let's have a geeky you guys are nice so far oh so close fed that bastard back down though I thought I would look cooler than just shut up shooting off of it good probably shot off it but No do I have such a hard time with this sometimes that's deal it I'll leave that for him dude we look so weird oh my god dude what's that pass look so weird we're just doing the weirdest thing oh my god like scooped it up but we should be in different brackets here this guy's wholesome oh my god I suck outside just bang it in them oh my god what is happening is the one Shirley way no way actually swearable flip how do you got it try Plata suggestin this is the one all Mike God is almost the pinch we got to go for like a nutty pinch I'll shut the crown pinch we're so close to so many like insane goals right now Jared's oh dude got this ranked Smurfs yeah Kawasaki he seems a little upset but the other guy seems like he's chillin oh my god I got a fast dude I the best I can't do it I can't shoot right now I'm gonna go back no we blocked me dude that's Paul - you can really get so good I see a high rank I'm gonna get good to the point where they're gonna block every single attempted this I was just enough dougie on my left side somewhere all I couldn't reach even my passes are off this game with the flip one it gets not getting close to the wall and still lucky where does he gotta keep passing that's the issue of this in the lower ranks man you're gonna get upset and stop playing probably I feel like I don't know if we're columns I think we're gonna get a lot of like team pinches that's the one thing I think is gonna be way easier real cool tools yeah I feel like they're definitely dads just by how they talk well I've had a lot of close attempts a lot of close to times this game but couldn't quite nail the best-looking ones but we came close we came close anyway we got three more games of the placement out of the river five out of ten right now so we got five more to go we'll do them in the next few videos probably two videos it'll be done with their placements that we'll get into comms so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the have yourself a wonderful day or night with the time is when you're
