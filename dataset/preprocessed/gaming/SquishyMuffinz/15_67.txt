yo what's up guys for today's video we're gonna be doing some of the extra game modes placements i did placements in ones twos and threes so far so i decided why not let's do some of the extra game modes but seeing some comments asking me to do it so it'll be cueing all four whatever we'll get we'll play um and yeah it'll be fun so let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got jamal lippmann and more of london's mean seba i wonder if his name's like sebastian or something i always i really like names that are like gamer tags that are like play on of your name i always think they're sick like there's a a pro player named sea bass his name is sebastian i always thought that was a cool name better bump this guy back wall almost in aerial stuff in hoops that's why i love hoops i feel like you've so much time in the air so much time to to make plays in the air gives you a lot of freedom for what you can do with the ball that's right i want to play this middle for a pass i thought my teammate was there but i think i i must have like saw him at a certain time and raise that look the way he turned i probably scored this actually nice that's a lot of what this game mode is aerial control you're very comfortable at air dribbling and stuff like that you have a lot of opportunities to um you know double tap and any kind of like irrigable mixture like variation in there to get over them you have so many options in this mode [Music] that's a hard one to save okay we got it out oh my gosh that's so awkward if i flipped or jumped at all that was going to be an own goal actually really good play from them to get it there so your flippy set here played over two maybe double tap there you go [Music] good first touch to control i actually like this game mode a lot though i feel like it does teach you a good amount i'm not gonna lie teaches you how to get it by someone in the air which is actually very important in 3v3 and 2v2 i like that a lot about this mode another opportunity for interval here which i played over him can't double cause i got bumped but it was a really good uh challenge from him save my boost here play round one try to get one more pop over him let my teammate go double tap good try don't let him touch this again if he goes again it's actually not gonna do anything most of the time actually almost insane i don't know how he flipped that in like that did not expect them job for my teammate try to pop it up and a fake challenge here let him hit this away it's fine made both of them commit and i have full boost now to make it past this middle it'll be big she's gonna wait behind him pop it up to myself uh try to dunk him off the ceiling it's a good try turn on this not the best challenge for me to be honest a really good job for my teammates to be back in time oh so close almost use the wall dashes to get that goal nice teammates doing really good on defense saving a lot of these uh opportunities for them take their boost here gonna leave not try to rotate a good spot to save this the the lip of the net always gets me in this mode too i always forget that you can't go through it pass my teammate put it off the back wall no that's actually bad i should have scored that for sure i know much boost left but i should i should have like had a position for that like i should have paid attention to my boost more i was playing that out like i had a lot more to work with really good saves from them honestly everyone's defense has been good in this lobby so far go for the back boost here no point of like continuing to dribble that into my corner put around one close and backwall just gotta wait though really good win my teammates honestly like doing everything he has to do right he's playing simple but it's it's perfect to see exactly what's needed in all these situations he's doing a really good job oh my better read it oh my gosh should be okay here shouldn't be too dangerous balls pretty low on the ground [Music] nice right there the little wall dash might have helped i'm not sure if i feel like a little bit more speed that's why i try to throw those in because it does help and you don't waste any boost but it is useful definitely choose the right times to use it though did it go for a weird kick off there do you make it hold it down i trust them dude these solid on defense he had it again too i didn't expect him to have more boost it's crazy one touch to myself here let's flick it high let me go for a shot why not actually really good shot good play around one again i think i mentioned this in one of the previous like two or three videos but you have so much space to the left or right almost always if you've you don't space the left or right you probably have space above them so try to use that to your advantage i try to really look for all the options you have when you're trying to outplay somebody there's almost always more options than just going straight toward the net and that's what's going to be expected the most of you look how much space i have to the left again right so i'm going to use it it's back wall here i try to get above them sometimes you have no options except to just go in a straight line and that's when you got to use the the height advantage right going above them will work better you got to use that let's pop my teammate maybe a shot here i don't think i can a little bit too sharp of an angle nice read from him all right good first game is a lot of fun i hope we get hoops again i actually really like hoops so i'm gonna q all four game modes again wherever we will get we'll end up playing but uh yeah get into it see if we get some more wins for today all right we got more vlogs again i think he was in the last game right should i stay on this i'm glad we got hoops again though nice challenge yeah my teammate last game played very very solid and that's like usually a good example of what i always preach i feel like when i'm making these videos that you don't need to do anything crazy you just got to play solid choose the balls you go for correctly and you're going to be winning a lot more games just because of that alone let them challenge this blending this away too should be fine nice for my teammate one more touch could be really dangerous for him if you can get it let's say on this i can't shoot but i can at least keep it grounded it's my teammate one touch to me maybe close let me go back wall surprise he's able to get such a good flick on that to be honest gotta wait here all right we have some time all right perfect situation without the back wall i got bumped again the common common theme it's the best way to defend that situation though especially when you're kind of just screwed honestly if someone gets in that spot you're kind of in a situation where you have to hope they miss and you never really want to be in that spot you want to have control in those situations right so the bump definitely is best case scenario it should be a goal if i can just pinch it down nice that that's all just getting above the ball too in this situation right and that's gonna be really hard for them to save because you have to read if that's going like out because it could go out it could go like super tight on the wall could literally go left right anywhere so they have to read so many different things there on defense it's really down to just getting lucky in that situation let him hit this hopefully it's not crazy shot alright we're good i think i'm gonna go for that i hope my teammate can deal with it nice way for amazes touch shouldn't be that bad for us here you can just go back wall gotta double this now should every net nice control it's another good example of just waiting for a good opportunity right i saw both of them were kind of panicking for that it wasn't going to be a super dangerous situation for us so all i had to do was play patient backboard controlled the ball worked out pretty well for us let him hit that good challenge room i should have went a little bit quicker i probably could have beat him but i wanted to see if i can bait him in first played around him who's going to come back but we can maybe get a flip out of this go over something crazy it's a good idea do you miss your turn on this try to wait just in case he misses too because that is an option that could happen try to read them oh it's actually close played around him again trying to find the open space it's a lot of the same situations right it comes up and hoops a lot too like both of these guys are panicking and now like a situation that i have because of it do you may end up saving it but it's okay just need some help here [Music] all right patience paid off they're not boost i'm just waiting for this one now i trust my teammate i should have control now i can't recover that well the demo might have just on gold i was trying something crazy that was my bad i was kind of messing around a bit i was gonna try to hit the ball once and then wall dash but i hit it too far i miss her at the bounce and then i slam into the room as well all good so i don't know like what the best kickoff is in this mode though i think i'd be sick if there's like a tournament like a big pro tournament in this mode like an rlcs for hoops nice get control there and again his challenge was a little bit late so ended up going above him and above his teammate it kind of set me up and i didn't have to do much i was grounded that whole time right [Music] it's a big dog it's not going to be in though look at idea i like the fake there look at this it from him [Music] sorry about that me played around once a little pop look at the time we have now i could just go above them like if you really break down a 202 game mode any 2v2 into like two little 1b ones it makes it so much simpler you don't have to worry about it as much right just focus on getting by the first guy and keeping like really close possession if you could do that you're gonna get by the second one pretty easily too and that's when you know you have to obviously practice your mechanics and get to a point where you're very comfortable in like every situation and that's very hard but the more you try things the more you'll improve at it and the more you fail the more you improve as well that's something that i think a lot of people underestimate how much everyone that's currently really good at this game or good at anything in life how much they failed to get there i feel like doesn't matter what sport you think of doesn't matter what game you think of esport what job anything i feel like you've got to fail before you become extremely good at it i feel a lot of times i've failed tens of thousands of times everything everything you see me do alright hundreds of thousands of times honestly how many games i've played and i still to this day fail you never really stop failing but that's good you look at it in a good way i guess yeah good games for today actually a lot of fun i really like this game mode definitely my favorite extra game mode i'll try to play some of the other ones for the next video yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one love y'all peace yes
