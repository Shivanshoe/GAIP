yo what's up guys so in the last video the last two videos we did a uh two game set of hoops we played snow day then it didn't let us queue another snow day game so it auto cued for rumble so we have one played in each of these so we'll uncue both of these and we'll play two drop shot games for today because it's the last mode that we haven't played for a video so let's do two games for that and then i'll probably again i'll show you guys when i get my rank for hoops and maybe when i get my rank for like drop shot or something like that cause i like these two modes more than um all the other ones for sure i definitely enjoyed these two over snow day and rumble but uh yeah let's play some drop shot for today let's get into it all right so guys when i tell you that i have to queue eu servers west servers and e-servers and it still took 30 minutes to find the game i am not joking i didn't realize people don't play this game that much it's going to be a very laggy game guys i i apologize in advance oh no but my team has been flying i fight to the left played over both yeah i did not uh realize this game mode was struggling to find players maybe it's the time i'm queuing you guys will be seeing this like way after i'm pre-recording videos because i'll be gone in sweden for the rcs major for like a week and a half i'll be gone maybe two weeks um so i'm recording this on the american thanksgiving so it's november 25th right now so i'm guessing because it's thanksgiving there's no one playing this n a but i don't know there's a lot of canadian people that don't have thanksgiving right now so i honestly don't know time to figure it out this game mode's usually popping though i was kind of confused why it took so long we're doing good though we don't have a single spot of damage on our side oh my i really like this mode though i play this mode with so much potential same thing that i feel about hoops i feel like this mode in pro play would be crazy with three players that know how to keep pressure and work really well together it'd be insane it's a really good block though is this a hoax or what's happening that's funny i don't know why i find his wording of that so funny is this a hoax look at the bounce here which i played over one actually good big challenge from frank they both missed played everyone again that's what i try to just focus on just getting it like in a really awkward spot for all of them it doesn't really matter if they get a hit on it if you're gonna be able to pull up the next one right so try to put in a weird spot for them every time i'm gonna fake this you may came from behind actually almost worked like the surprise factor there again let him get a bad touch maybe let another one get a bad touch here and then try to follow it up after it's kind of the way i like to put out this mode wait for the opportunity right play back i'll try to fight like into this patch of damage try to get a bigger hole like an actual opening to score but again double commits triple commits in this mode i feel like are very likely like even though my teammate keeps seeing me under the ball he keeps going and that's just kind of what happens in this mode because there's there's really no trust in each other how's it going 50 from him it's really not a lot of trust in each other and that's just what the this mode kind of brings out of people i think the chaos aspect it's a lot of just waiting for the right time white middle here doug dimmadome is that from a show wait what i didn't swear no way that's for my show no dimmadome is that fairly oddparents doesn't sound right though is it doug sorry this is bad bad commentary i'm trying to figure out where this is from sounds so familiar why maybe he has a picture he does okay yeah that's definitely fairly oddparents right one with timmy turner dude i don't even remember been so long [Music] question mark what i find that's so funny my ping's not that bad oh frank thanks getting a little saucy a little bit toxic it's okay i mean i'll be honest with you frank uk you're planning on playing drop shot and not having your teammates be on each other the whole time you're playing the wrong mode my brother definitely playing the wrong mode oh it's getting heated every time i play eu servers it gets uh it gets heated i don't know if that's a coincidence let me know the guys that cue european rank or european whatever your servers all the time let me know if it's always stocked because every time i play someone's saying something maybe the europeans are just more vocal with their their feelings and their thoughts and they keeps it inside then a servers i think frank's saying they they could have won this if they weren't on each other the whole time but i don't know i don't know our team's pretty thawed we got doug dimmadome i don't think we're losing that all right good first game though let's cue for another 20 minutes hopefully he finds the game a little bit quicker um but yeah that was actually actually fun first match let's get into the next one if we ever can find the match can't believe it guys we actually got a second game and it only took 10 minutes so 30 minutes of q time for today's video hopefully we can end it off on a dub here it's a us west server too i don't know why i can't find any e-servers playing drop shot right now i turn on high quality shaders in my video settings and the game looks crazy it makes the game look so much nicer look i should always have this on we could definitely lose this i got to focus up one more touch nice pass i have a good feeling about this game they have roblox 420 though on their team i don't know that'd be hard but that's big damage how do you say that guy's name i know to say that better bump this guy i feel like demos are op in this mode i remember like way back i'm thinking like 2015 maybe 2016. there was like whenever this mod came out i want to say this 2016 like late 2016 probably i was doing 1v1 tournaments against like scrub killa and like a couple other really good players that were in it and every single time if you demoed someone it was a goal i feel like in threes it's like that but like on a smaller scale obviously oh my gosh look at the damage you get one demo in threes i feel like it's huge in this mode because you need to be covering so much of the field right of the map i should say one guy's dead that's so much of the map that can't be covered so once in this is really interesting as well very mind gamey i'd love to see how it's played now what people can do these days i saved from them i'm gonna leave it for my teammate nice probably fake them as well me just leaving that oh we have so much damage already at 49. we probably got all the big the big hits let's finish my teammate look how hard that is to cover right this mode there's so much to it imagine i was super intense this can get with three uh pro players on each side right they probably would be quite good at covering everything honestly the awareness to be able to cover everything it's really hard to have that but i feel like it'd be really fun to watch maybe i can set that up someday maybe get my team versus another team in this mode the fun thing to watch when you're doing something like that too is how the players and teams adjust to it because people will adjust to real quick they'll like create metas in a way like very fast you'll find out what works and you'll try to grow on it that's kind of how rocket league's like evolved over the years the pro players finding things that work really well and just trying to add on add-on all the time right so you'd find players will get really good at improvising and doing things that work really well in this mode i'm in goal when i'm playing this though i've been playing ranked in this if you guys are trying to get like high rank just trying to step on your teammates toes too much because i mean like that frank guy from last game was saying and he was kind of complaining oh my gosh that was crazy uh what he was saying is like it's kind of true in a way like they were all over each other but at the same time there's no way he was playing perfectly and not doing it as well so i think that's something that you could definitely use your advantage in this mode it's trying to spread out even if like my teammate messes me up on this i don't really mind because most of time it ends up working fine it's very chaotic it's a big demo you'll see like the difference that demo makes you there's no help now too i could probably get a really free touch to the side it's fine if i get beat here timmy should have it nice should be there oh good it's not a big deal a little bit of damage one touch if that's a pass that'd be great that's why me too even passing in this to get a touch of super unexpected is really op as well yeah two goal lead two will lead in this as well you have to break the ground and then make a hole in the ground to get that back it's really hard very very hard such a big buffer if you get one more goal the game's pretty much over i feel like that's like the game secured my first touch here nice touches around you guys should be there nice just gonna wait for a wolf maybe a double here getting quiet i'm just waiting for like one of them to make a big mistake but they're actually doing a good job controlling it i was like surprised for a second i thought they were gonna get like on each other and make a big mistake there but never came my bad actually ended up working for the pinched nice we should have this it's gonna be really hard for some day to go and an extra one to come back i'm still gonna try not to concede here the first touch to me just slowing down right there i know it's not gonna be off the wall right it's probably just gonna come to me i play that patient if you move up too far a lot of time that'll hurt you try to say like and it's probably recovering both options like right here too i can kind of just show nothing anything too crazy didn't get any damage there and i pretty much just sat on the ground afk oh yeah good games today it took
