yo what's up guys gonna be playing all three game modes yet again for today let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes after the first team we got sandvik against jalen and little jalen minion all right look at the back boost just chill behind my teammate he should be the first challenge here wait for the bump he was going for a bump there if i flick it once he's trying to bump me if someone's trying to bump you like if they're close behind you like that like chasing you or if you can't see them on your screen for a bit they're probably looking for a bump i'd say most of the time let's see you want to try to speed up the play a bit because they're going to take advantage of you going a little bit slower if you do might be in it's good good job to catch him off there he's flat-footed by a bit but yeah usually if someone's trying to bump you like that speed up your dribble a little bit go for a quick flick it doesn't matter you're not always playing for a goal if someone's trying to bump you you're probably not going to get a goal most of the time so if that's the case then best case scenario is just to try to speed up your dribble try to make it hard for them to bump you and stay alive be a nuisance your bump hope the other boost here way to cross for the 50 take this boost from what's going to stop him from making any kind of good play on this ball now i'm gonna fake this ah i tried to make it pretty much impossible for him to get out of that he did a really good job 50 worked out really well for him let's talk to myself hopefully good try teammate has to play this smart that's a good job i got my teammate i actually won all those fifties i thought it didn't get beat which i wanted back should just be patient here not gonna be a goal for him messed up the flip as well i take my time on this good bump i don't think he intended to bump me at all to be honest but it worked out really well for they sent me flying always happens to me when i get bumped like i'm flying i feel like when i bought other people they just are never affected it's so odd all right i took advantage of them kind of messing up their kickoff one of them backflipped or something are you like oh okay you try to do a speedflip but he tilted his car too far down just like look like this by a accident bit of a mechanical error there might be and threes is a big idea to go for it would have probably just been a goal straight up but who's probably not worth it although i could have definitely scored it my teammate's not going to back off for me so oh i messed up a bit i wanted to fake the the first shot there like to go down to the ground and then keep going off a drift but ah it's unfortunate unlucky human didn't get the takeoff you wanted as well like if he just hits faster perfectly it's pretty safe for him a little bit late to it i'm gonna answer the challenge off the first touch teammates should be okay take his boost hopefully actually i can't i'm just gonna wait get behind my teammate here maybe first challenge i don't like challenging from the wall what my teammate just did you're always gonna leave your teammate oh i don't like him going for that either but you always leave your team in a really bad spa if you do that and you're almost never going to win the ball which the whole point of challenging is winning the ball or at least getting some some sort of touch that's interfering with the opponent not doing either of those things going off the wall just like you you limit yourself so much if i'm jumping from here to challenge i'm doing a lot more than if i'm uh like that challenge is really good if i'm going off the wall though like look i'm only blocking like so little of the field right they have so much of the field to get around me if i'm dead smack in the middle when i jump i'm blocking everything and the most important thing is the net which you're blocking if you jump for more center field than anything my first touches here is a flip this does one more touch here it's fine i could do anything with these balls so you flip here so laggy it looked like i didn't even get the flip and then i got it after somehow nice touches i'm gonna fake this try to block him hit the mid boost here gotta watch her bump i know you guys behind me so like i said you gotta be careful for a bump when someone's not on your screen for a while it's fine it's not gonna get anything out of that too much free touch not the greatest touch i gotta try to keep this close it's awesome time here got the bump as well should be a goal i have some time on this the 50s they're doing a good job their goal line 50 is actually really good and solid hard for me to get through i played around them [Music] nice yeah pretty much gets a free gold day that's just good positioning put himself in a spot where he could react to if i get the ball past that guy going to be there for and if that guy gets a bad touch he can score it as well it's good positioning it's a good job i'm gonna fake this probably not gonna expect me to miss oh we actually did i could've just boomed it so i was hoping you would respect that i could easily beat him to it and ended up giving me a little bit more space but didn't end up working out i thought that's fine broccoli goes always time i'm gonna do it again here and see if it works did not work i just wanted to try it one more time no dude they don't care so i could just boom it and they'll be too pushed up if i boom it so they're not playing for the hit that i can get which actually is valuable information to have i think i just jump up to block it any kind of touch on him there is really good can be enough to stop their play teammates should have pushed out a lot earlier he might get scored on off that uh i do not think he'd just shoot it's fine though yeah as soon as as soon as i hit off the wall goes my teammate can beat him by by a mile pretty much if he just instantly goes but he's a little late to it maybe he had no boost only thing i could think of there i don't know if they're doing weird fake offs or what that is but guys played around them actually could have been bad because i got bumped but messed up the dribble i could just bump him now bump the other guy as well i don't have enough boost to carry that on good first game though let's get into the next one so even keep it up get back to back dubs on the date let's see how it goes all right for lasting got clouds l against twilight vexi and powerful alrighty see how this goes good first sessions i'm just gonna wait for powerful such it's not gonna be perfect i know that can i follow my teammates touch now round one i have 1v1 i'm gonna fake this low 50. makes it really hard on the last guy back because i i saw he was getting pressured by a bump as well so he's gonna be a little bit more antsy than usual could have went one more high he probably would have saved it though low 50s more often not gonna work there should we get back great save my boost kick off wait for the bounce that's a little awkward give myself some more time on the ball here really good 50s takes two out of the play and the third one instant jump that might yeah let him hit that's fine i'm not gonna go because i heard him up no point i can go for this though oh i should have been fine could have for sure like been back i'm not sure where he went see i turned back toward the play so that's his mistake there always turn toward net basically is the big thing if unless the ball is for sure coming toward you always turn toward now if you don't have control of the ball do not turn turn toward the wall especially if you're third man it's like one of the biggest mistakes you can make and that's actually a big mistake that a lot of people make on kickoff is they turn instantly toward the play instead of toward the net and that's actually a lot of kickoff goals if you guys pay attention uh to rlcs games it's a big thing at least a lot of gay opticals and um actually something that c9 needs to do badly and we made that change and we almost never got scored on kickoffs going from uh turning toward net to not so for example on kickoff it's very basic concept yes prior to standard already but instead of i'll show you guys next time just kick off instead of we're about to get scored on might be a goal no okay pretty it's pretty obvious but say i'm getting busy off here if i'm flipping toward this boost instead of moving up feel like this as soon as i grab this boost i turned back toward my net that's all i mean by that i got to go on to show you guys that but i think it was worth it instead of um so right here's a good example i'm not going to go [ __ ] you off so you see i get the boost and i instantly go toward the net so i'm blocking that immediately instead of getting that boost and then turning upfield that's all i mean the very like simple thing that's exactly what my teammate got scored on back there too he turned up field instantly instead of uh covering the net which is the most important thing that's your goal when you're on when you're on defense the the net is the most important thing that's your your main goal your main focus should be always covering your net making sure there's never an open situation everything in this game sounds so simple when you say it and then doing it is actually pretty difficult there's so much to keep track of actually really a try just playing as miss almost left to go play back to my teammate good touch again my goal here is covering the net all i have to worry about i don't have any boost it's gonna be a little bit difficult but we did a good job putting it back in as quick as i can should be a goal i meant to make it touch a little bit to the right or good nice good job same thing here i'm turning away from the ball right away that way i give myself some more options and i can beat this guy still you see it still gives me more than enough offensive pressure except there's no risk in it which i think is the main thing it's probably a goal against us a challenge actually wow i didn't think that was what would come with that messed up his control a bit i challenge him also when you're coming back big pad route just straight down the middle it's a really important one and a good thing about that um that way back is you can turn left or right wherever you see the ball go you're covering basically everything so i like that one the most probably nice challenge try to just bump them be a little bit annoying there's also a good one right here play around the outside we're trying to rotate a little bit wider there's a couple of them that you guys should learn i think are really useful that's the big one i like to go for let's see what happened here he missed back for a while me and my teammate both doubled me on that which is the first issue but he's lost back for a while and you went for a flip touch that's like worst thing you could do as well in a lost back situation there's a really good last life situation that you guys could learn from be my teammate going for the same ball there it's a mistake but it's a harder one to to not do i think because you can't really control your teammate coming from underneath you a little bit of a harder thing to do but you can you have full control on a last-minute situation where you have possession so it's a much more avoidable situation at that point you you have it in your hands to fix the double commit that occurred right all you have to do is just dribble the ball or go for a low 50 anything that stall it stalling like that right there is a good touch it's the opposite what you did last time and look like he's able to get back to it and make a secondary save and even the third so good examples of doing it well that time but if you're low rank that'll help you a ton if you're third man don't go for like a flip touch or anything where you're full committing to a situation because like i'm third man here look at how i'm playing this situation i still have full possession and i i can basically get through the whole team here and i did just off doing that i stayed grounded and i waited for my my chance to uh actually move forward and make a play there there we go did you hope you guys enjoyed have yourself on the day or night with what's happening guys watch this like comment subscribe to see us on the next one i love y'all you
