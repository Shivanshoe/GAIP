yo what's up guys going to be solo queueing some twos threes and also queuing ones for today so whatever we end up getting we'll play let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes all right we got arsenal off the bat here gonna be a very sweaty one there we go it's a really really good shot to start it off with um my game towards arsenal in the past when i played them they've always been extremely close and it's like they're ready back and forth we go like trading wins back and forth the whole time so it'll be interesting it's a very very smart player the way he plays twos and ones very very good it's not going to be easy by any means let him flick that can we go for this actually really good read from him might even be a goal it's a good save i messed up my touch a bit should be okay though might be dangerous now it's gonna be pretty good in this situation but played it well i got for him to get his flip there he's playing on a smurf by the way right now this isn't his main account but i know it's for sure him but playing pretty well so far you guys tell by the way he plays out of tim but yeah i've heard he's been on a smurf play across here good patience it's actually really good in situations too so don't want to give them too much space really good saves from us so far three minutes left two gold lead it's really not much in in 1v1 but our main goal should be try to keep possession create some good opportunities i shouldn't have that much boost here should be a goal for us there we go well played let him try to be a little bit mechanical and he messes it up i get the goal and if he gets to go out of it i'll play to him it's gonna be a hard shot to get right the way i like to think about those situations if they make the play good on them right it's a really good play from them if not then it's gonna be all for us so i'm gonna save my boost here i'm gonna fake jump so he thinks i'm going again to waste the rest of his boost right to the wall he got the boost here a little bit unfortunate i should just leave i'm just gonna close the space down a bit take my time on these saves awkward situation he's very good at putting you in his awkward situations but if you take your time and you try to like save your flip for the last second all these saves you're going to be able to be in a good position most of the time regardless of how good the opponent really is notice how i'm trying not to over commit my challenges as well you got to watch out for demos when it's arsenal very very good at bumping yeah i gotta watch it for the bumps the classic i gotta be careful it's the same like likewise the other way right i don't want to over commit there that's why i'm not going for like a full-on shot out of that i'm more just trying to make sure he's forced to make a save and i don't waste too much of my boost for myself in a bad spot it's gonna be really really tough thing to save here though but yeah that's like a really good example of what i don't want to be doing every single time i don't want to be falling down with the ball like that like it's all in place i try to go for the low 50 instead of just you know maybe this goes in maybe it doesn't i'd rather it be a higher percentage kind of play you got 50. i'm going to the ground here right to the corner that's fine it should kill some time for me to get back at least get some boost let's try to close down the space this is a really awkward situation too really good save though really good timing on the challenge that's the hardest thing to do in this situation is actually time that challenge right nice well done four one minute fifty one left i'm gonna actually go up and kick off i picked it twice so far so he's gonna expect it really a challenge go for his back boost here probably gonna be able to turn on this take his other back boost really good soft touch to myself plus as long as it's not posted out i don't mind i also got his boot search pretty big but not gonna be a tough situation yeah it's a good good flick very good in those situations when he has boost he had some extra from the boost pads and i didn't realize tried to cut down the space few too many times instead of just playing the should i beat again awkward situation gonna be really tough actually messed up but ended up working out pretty well he's good at making the situation very awkward it's a good challenge to to go for i think i don't want to give him like too much free space on the sidewall there it's normally pretty dangerous i'm gonna panic a little bit i'm gonna fake jump here should get this ball for free now uh it might should be bad for me yeah i think it's a goal unlucky 30 seconds left this is usually how these games go with barcelona did a good job to make a little comeback i shouldn't have jumped again there though he wanted me to and i gave him what he wanted better watch out he loves just baiting you in the corners shouldn't have a crazy amount of boosts left might still be a goal though i actually faked that i was good at him take this back boost you might have just stole the game i did to fake them out just enough i should have maybe stalled on the goal line the last three seconds and try to score at the end the like a kiosk might happen here he didn't try something weird all right we should have this one second left so just kill it there we go all right good game always play one verse arsenal very very sweaty game hope you guys enjoyed that and i'll cue one more again one two three whatever we get we'll play get into it let's see how it goes arsenal again back-to-back games here i can see him winning this for sure not the best he off the start he likes to do that single jump kick off very interesting actually really tough situation to get out of probably but not gonna be a goal unfortunately should be able to win this boost at least which is good win this boost is well you can start starving them a bit ah that's actually really unfortunate played to empty space at least he got the boost but not the biggest deal good win if i get this backwards from him pretty big as well we're essentially just fighting for the boost at this point whoever wins like the most important boost battle is going to get the goal first here oh you got the demo it's probably actually just a lot of that i spawned on a bad side for it actually really the patience got to dive early on that and that's what got me the goal there i did so many options and arsenal's obviously a threatening player in a situation so the fact that i didn't dive really is actually very good and i could have been you know panicked there because i spawned opposite side you probably should have gotten to go out of that it's good that i held my ground there love's going high on these dribbles yeah it's really hard to do anything because you don't have a teammate behind you right and twos and threes doesn't really matter but and ones obviously you have no help you have to just try to go he plays it well so i don't like that much about ones because you can't really do much about those situations someone's good in the air and they have like good mechanics they're probably going to square off that most of the time that's how it is he goes instantly there actually works out well for him it's going to be a goal we missed and i got to go out of that i guess he couldn't score it but i thought he would take his time i thought he would take his time he goes instantly on that challenge it's a double but he couldn't turn it in time i guess but should have taken it to the corner if he couldn't get the shot actually get 50 there this thing will jump into that the awkward situation so i wanted to hit it across should i get out of the danger zone that's a good demo that's how you know we're playing arsenal doing stuff like that it's the classic this goes for demo there actually i could have definitely beaten him and gotten to go out of that if i expected the demo but it's a good play to make you don't really think people are going to go for a demo to spell like that you have to go like out of your way for it gonna backflip on that i'm gonna backflip back it's a really awkward situation here actually touch it one more and just leave you're gonna have it like a free touch here though it's a good block uh sucks can get that boost actually would have been really important but and i have to back off unfortunate just to the wall again i sure went again it's gonna be really bad for me now okay well he flicked it a little bit too hard just a tiny bit just a little bit i had to be careful on 50 like that he wants you to get baited in that's how like their whole team plays in threes they love just trying to like make you go for 50 like that again low 50 instead of the shot when you probably could honestly just score off of the shot i'm forced to block more of an angle it's gonna be a goal yeah very unfortunate he did a whole lot of nothing for like a minute there and it worked every time so he's probably gonna keep doing it he didn't do anything threatening to be honest but he just stayed right next to the ball the whole time it worked out really well for him but you could do that in once again because you have to destroy yourself with the ball you have to just challenge eventually that place talking definitely work can you go for a bump here at me probably gotta watch the bump so one thing always got to be careful of playing arsenal it's really a challenge you can actually score off this sucks but still fine let's go off that though somehow just just drive into it and single three three minute left gonna come down to a bump goal or something here and smell it i didn't think you'd shoot again that was good of him but ended up bouncing bar down look how long my recovery time is for this and he's going for a bump on me funny actually really a challenge maybe even a goal out of that potentially i'm gonna drive for a bump and then back off but it's probably gonna be a goal for him to be honest i'm just going to go for a mid boost why not actually know him for mid boost but i don't know i just said whatever this is what it is fighting it's whatever i gotta say left him in his side with like way too much boost the bump was like all in kind of play maybe i gotta go out of this i don't know we'll see actually almost worked game mode's so funny the most random stuff that like almost always ends up working in this mode i swear so i'm for like a bump on that and i should not have games though like i said games always go back and forth you got like three bump goals that game so i'll definitely i'll definitely take that being a close score line considering the amount of bumps that i didn't get that i went for ended up being not too bad but either way fun games hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a date or night but every time it is watching this like comment subscribe and see us on
