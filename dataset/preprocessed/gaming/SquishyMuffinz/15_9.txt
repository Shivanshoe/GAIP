expecting it once again but i am happy with this those goes look out for him i would say i'd say because he gets the boost and the ball i think that's like best case scenario in ones you get boost in ball always a good situation you just get to go straight off of it bad big challenge for me i like push up too far but so again best case scenario every single time if you get boost and ball in ones i feel like you're just getting cool that's why people do that kick off that's why i always used to do it i just made once all i did in the corners i read his this fake there it came off a little bit too obvious i think he didn't stay close enough on the wall to like threaten me and the balls in the air and he just went back down to the ground it's a little bit too obvious but he has no other play on that playing for the boost here so he has to back off he's going for my boost let's play this quick enough there we go as soon as i saw that he's going for my boost again that's just kind of my green light try to get it as fast as you can forward it's hard to get around that ball and get a good hit on it i was trying to make sure it's controlled still doing a single jump kick off it's actually good good save good job to stay not commit for the boost i'm smart all right we should have the ball for free here nice that was a good play used him chasing me and just try to like read his movement off of that like as soon as i saw he was chasing me he was in the line of chasing me i just moved out to the side and then swung at him got a good bump in it's good ones have been fun lately i know i haven't played a lot of my placements this season but they've been good the only thing is my kickoff is just not good so they always get this uh really good start like that every time it's pretty much just a free goal if they're decent if i get my kick off like that i feel like i have no problem being anyone in ones like that's like the biggest thing just getting yourself the ball in that situation is so huge i feel like mid game no matter who i'm playing against i always feel good they always feel confident but it's just kickoff is the one thing i don't feel confident in every ones nice wait for his turn here look at the challenge just to stay on this you can hit up the wall i was about challenged how to play for a bum didn't quite get it bad goal to give up though i went all in for a bump and if i got the bump isn't vehicle but not worth the risk i wasn't close enough to threaten it properly either it's kind of a troll it's going to be a gopro okay keep on recovering well for this it's fine ah so unlucky that's actually really unlucky it's all good try to hit up the wall around him that i can recover because i was gonna be screwed there and at least for a while so if i didn't get in the way in some form it was gonna be bad for me nice good 50. i was just like completely focused on when he was gonna challenge this and as soon as i saw what he was doing i tried to turn my car away from the play see if i can get a 50 that would be favorable for me yeah qagoff he does always going to get him to boost first which is a huge huge advantage situation we should be back for him i think okay i got it it's really good nice good idea to go for a bump there when's it a lot harder to like have commentary for i feel like it's a lot more focusing you really can't make any little mistakes especially everyone these days is very very good at once there's really just no no room for error i think that's miss oh wow that's a really unlucky bounce i'm glad i backed off like that could have been a filter there's not much of an angle there i knew that i'm playing for the boost here i think that i'm going for that boost and turn away if you have an angle now okay it works should be fun let me go quick to this something expected okay you didn't expect it again one of those just last second things this game if i played the safe route every single time i'd be winning by so much more i've gotten myself scored on by trying to be aggressive because i can't really tell how he wants to play stuff i'll take a shot here he has advantage still a little bit of unfortunate stuff going on but it's not terrible these situations be a challenge look for the boost i have control here i'm gonna play it off to the left side give myself some space on a bounce dribble go for just a straight up shot tv does it's a good block following for a long time there probably just gonna boom this yeah right to the corner soft touch to myself here let him save that's fine i'm gonna fake jump i think you read it unfortunate again that situation could go so much better for me it's just like the little things aren't quite going my way i think it goes so much better that goes anywhere but up i'm in a really good situation there go for edge of them nice it's a good bounce for it again like whoever gets the boost and the ball you go i swear it just gets the goal nice i'm not sure he didn't kick off there i want it really hard oh we tried to go fast he tried to get straight up fast beat to the side oh he's assuming because it was a corner up he was assuming that i was going to do the fake so he was just calling a bluff essentially we get attempts gonna save it let's go straight back try to stay in a good spot to defend this it's gonna be over it's fine his angle is not much here so you're just straight so all i have to do is cover that little sliver can't do much with that at all good read on the challenge how have i kept this up yeah no i wanted to keep it up in the corner how did i keep that up that was crazy all right good first game let's try to see if we can get another one's game i hope we can the other rematch would be good but he's solid for sure against the next one's even keep it up let's go all right for last time we got a tease game we got turbo on our team this would be fun i haven't played two turbo one so long 250. nice good start it's gonna fake there's no angle there i have everything on the back wall and there was everything in that sorry no threat that was bad though sorry probably didn't see him the ball is okay this situation is weird because i beat the first guy which is really good and then turbo's pv the ball is like at an angle so he sees this outfit doesn't see what's on the right so he didn't know that that guy was that close so it looks like a big mistake but really it's just hard to uh to see that trying to go for turbo here just to help him out he's getting bumped as well last back so it's good to help in situations i always use your right stick too like if you're in a situation where you're not sure where your teammates going or where they're going to be how do you use a red stick to help you out a bit on how to read the play or what you should expect next play it down to the ground as quick as i can here maybe last back for a long time okay could have been bad the bump bit number one off the back wall therefore i think he might thought the first one was a pass room i'm not sure what it looked like good kill one should have played around him again can't actually pass off of it but put some pressure off that 1v1 now you can beat him playing for the back boost here it's about to beat him to this soft flesh to myself hit around one i'll get a flip here i almost little try let's save nice let's go play here's my time why is he there i know he was backing off so i knew i had some space to work with you guys never watched i didn't eye tracker video a long time ago you can see how much i look for what the opponent's doing and all pros try to do that to try to be actively trying to see what the opponent is going to be doing next trying to use their current like car positioning to figure out what they want to do next most time it's pretty obvious you really don't have that many options in a lot of situations in this game it's not that hard to read where the ball will be like he's coming from the left side there again you can kind of see everything like where the ball is going to go he's coming from the left spider right vice versa so you can pre-position based off those things might just be straight then ah could have had it i think i think he panicked a bit could have definitely had it could have got around it get an extra second too but it might have looked different from his pov save my boost here drop interval to help just in case because that's a good shot there's something you got a pinch box here i think good shot like ground pinched it yeah and faster than it should have by a little bit try to take these two pads i'll be the first to go your child should be back well does it get over me it should be okay nice close i can't commit to this way close to the ball than me i'm gonna go here for turbo it's around me it's a good touch you follow there gonna wait for what happens here save my full boost i can react whatever's gonna go on tried to see if i can get the edge of my flip to get the goal there let me go quick i was fifteen terabytes volume actually a good idea from him though he's trying to help me because i was last back he's trying to go from under the ball see if you can help me out i was gonna try the cut wasn't sharp enough but it was a bad idea behind twenty boosts here good demo just stay close to this wow take the boost it should be a goal nice all right oh good i did shot good job take advantage of them being open so it's that all right good games today i hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night with 10 minutes you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
