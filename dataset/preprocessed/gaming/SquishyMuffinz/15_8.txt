yo what's up guys gonna be queueing all three motions today so one season three's where we get we'll play i'm still on the fending front of you wondering so let's get into it get some dopes see how it goes oh we got a gimmick against bambi and cheese nice i tend to play really good gimmick which is good obviously i had a lot of time played with him so and to know what he wants to do he likes to know he likes to be where i'm gonna hit the ball early which is nice very smart player hit the left here i'm gonna fake this let him hit it it's fine i'm not gonna have any play on that all you do is hit it badly after that that's just good yeah i'm not going to go for this actually i might just hit it why not it wasn't terrible i realized they could probably get there so if i didn't go forward or just going to be giving the ball away right to the corner please save 1v1 now just gimmick in these situations create some pressure to get 50. can't do much else with it though i'm gonna get some pads instead good patience just barely paying off trying to bump for him ah that might be a goal yeah tried to bump for him tried to help him out but i should just went back i got the bump which i think gimmick was just full testing i was getting the bump there it's probably gonna be a goal for us i can't do anything about that unfortunate those things happen there's not much you can do just over your head  heating you're pretty much in no man's land i play it over to him wait for a touch here your challenge actually good for us both of them went which is nice to create a good opportunity but it's actually going to be the other way for them now getting back to all of these things i don't know how to be honest we should have gotten scored on so many times this game let's open space try to take the corner boost here down to him good idea should be a goal here i save a lot of time nothing bad at all they're solid opponents they're gonna be putting up a good fight so i can't really complain that performance we just have to defend a lot this game there we go we got it back it's a good cheat i thought cheating is important we're dead even half of the game left is very important but again like it's two sides to it they gotta go off of the ball going over my head as a cheater and i can't really do much after that point there's too much time to to pick their their spot on the shot there he's gonna have a touch controlled up the wall here let's play one more over him the patient shouldn't give me i'm gonna fake that out for a double just force them to hit it away you make sure you win this on the wall i should have bumped them would have been this morning almost worked tried to catch him on the timing when he was coming down off that flip nice good pressure good job give me two ready for that all i did was hit it toward that hard for him to get an angle but if i can get a touch like that it was gonna be perfect i'm gonna go for him here it should be okay hard to shoot nice patient i like my gimmick just right there backing up is actually really smart nice and easy i like that little cut smart i'm gonna fake jump here make a panic a bit good demo gimmicks last for a bit so good save he's gonna pre-jump shot i can reach it that was good from gimmick though he forced him to go like wide didn't really have a good shot off of it but we'll play from them they're converted quickly trying to get behind me i just trusted that he had it to play again just being a little bit patient in situations tends to pay off this might be bad though nice challenge good shot as well i have advantage here so i just hit it around him the wall for gimmick he cuts it off still fine for us i think nice pop i hit under him it's actually really really good to do that there i feel like a good challenge as well i feel like it's like really underrated how good it is just to like lock them up lock the ball under them on a big challenge like that someone's always better than trying to beat them over a little bit too high i'll try to cut it off though and go back now i'll cut for a gimmick just gonna force him put it over me and i can go back i'm still back on 20 boost now should be fine we have too many layers of defense there but for gimmick he baits for me vice versa i keep getting behind them there's no way they can do anything but good first game there i'll buy gimmick for one more it's always fun playing with him and yeah let's get into it thing we got facial and spherey see those guys they have 200 geez i wonder where region they're playing from try to go back here pass to myself a little bit off on the flick but it was a good idea good try i forgive mix next touch probably there's one more i'm gonna pass one more to gimmick here didn't have any boost to get like above it but it's right idea i had like 10 more boosts definitely a goal but i still could play regardless wait for his touch here nice good job to take advantage of that actually really hard angle to get a shot on though hope you guys enjoyed the controller cam i have up so i'll let you guys ask for it back so decided to put it back up there for you gotta keep it up there for every video from now on i'm gonna wait here let me get two jump to the wall here good players gonna go back now some pads behind good bump from him challenge from you make playing for the boost here big jump nice big jump is all it took for the for that to work it's crazy i don't think i was gonna go quick to it obviously the ping might have a factor in that but when you're on 200 paying if you're from a different region it's still fairly consistent the only thing is just go sets and stuff like that so the thing might not have actually played a big factor in that but like 50s and stuff like what i just did probably like crazy on their perspective play it to myself here uh i didn't flip i wanted to get the flip out but almost let's play it's off myself so follow it up good demo leave it for gimmick now nice wait for the bounce here i did not think i'd beat him that's actually really really fast here must be the two cents i'm on two cents now if you guys didn't know but it feels really good all right that's gonna be all for today's video if you guys enjoyed having yourself on a full day or night but every time as you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one hopefully with the fenix still i don't want to change i love this car it's been feeling good so yeah let you guys see in the next i'm sure one day i'll be fine again
