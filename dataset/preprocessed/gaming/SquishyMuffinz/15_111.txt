game looks different to you guys because of that probably so anything that's changed from my settings from last video my nameplate skill is back on 100 default only thing that i've changed recently everything else is exactly what i had it on during championships good shot let's get saved played into a safe spot to the corner which is really good there well done for my teammate somehow somehow pulled that off that's impressive to be honest very good 50. i don't think he's particularly going for the shot there you know what i mean there's somebody that just kind of have i take my time it's not in so i have a focus shoulder ball here lick it to the wall maybe but i followed it myself gives me a good chance of staying on it when i do that it's actually a really good recovery from him hopefully i get 50 as well but they can't shoot off this for a little bit let my teammate go he's already up i want to double commit with him should have this as well surprised i died there and we didn't trade at the very least but should still be fine should go for me nice force to flick well done take my time get a really good clear over him but it can't really turn on very easily forcing the pass to my teammate as well by just driving up all right almost bad thought my team had to touch so i waited a sec i almost ended up bad but turned out fine i got bumped just a little bit there my teammate i'm just gonna chill on the wall here not to panic don't have to dive too early go back down to the ground now they threw away still in front of the ball here should be fine no way that can really be in our net as long as i covered a second bouncer obviously so anyway it could go badly i'm just gonna drive into this played around one insta dive which is fine i don't have to panic in front of these balls none of them are worth panicking for i check where he's at that way again i don't panic try to get a flippy sound that was a good idea touch for my teammate way back full boost here soft touch to myself let him panic if i see on this ball it's a good challenge honestly if i was in this position they're probably not challenging that just because kind of leaves his teammate in his barber he's forced to challenge the next ball which i don't really like doing very much but it's not a bad choice every now and then switch it up go for a challenge like that let him touch this now that i'm panic i didn't take a cut gotta make him panic again teammate gets the ball for free and i don't waste my position that i'm not doing anything too crazy this game i'm just trying to play in the spots where i need to be challenged i need to go for it's working out pretty good they haven't had any good opportunities really challenge i get fake on this if i played around them i do that well still playing plan to get spot to follow up again good blake good attempt teammates should be able to go next for this like this way middle should be fine i have a lot of time here look where the opponents are if i wait they're probably gonna rush this shot that's what i was expecting so i just weighed again been nice and patient let him hit this away should be fine i mean it should be there take my time again flick over one both went which is really good i bought the other guy out as well should be empty net good job it's a good example of only going for the balls that i need to go for only going for the outplays that i absolutely need to go for and then going for the important bump at the end good job for my teammate to be there empty net good job to capitalize i go straight back here in case you shoot should be over should be fine team is going to touch so i got to follow there we go took my time on the shot so i'll play good clear as well it wasn't a good spot where it kind of just floated gave me a lot of options in the air i could have faked it could have just waited on the floor anything there is really good i'm gonna fake jump here try to jump again try to just dribble him a little bit delay's rotation now he's gonna get back for a little bit longer than it would have been before my first touch fake this one take one more time here make him throw it away there we go we get the ball back for free i have to waste my position i have to do anything really big jump here make him panic fake again gonna throw it away eventually he missed doing the same thing i like it don't touch this it's fine never going to be a goal so i like that now i challenge when it can be a goal and there we go as soon as it's that dangerous situation that's when i want to go for the ball that's what i want to actually put a challenge up going for the pinch was actually in good try i'll play safe here again just wait on the floor it's coming back down to me good challenge it could be bad but we gotta do well took our time on the challenges like we're doing all game wait for his flick here to challenge my teammate now we have a full boost i'll just go quick for this ball now oh it would have been a really good double i had to put it quick i played high we did both of those things it's a very hard one to finish off perfectly fine i'm gonna go for the boost here instead of the ball ruins this whole play i need that as well we get the ball back for free a little decision that makes such a big difference so you ended up winning the the next sequence off of right try to pass middle yeah but it should be okay might be able to get a ghost out of it tried to pass that to be honest i wasn't trying to shoot and i completely missed saw where my teammate was at didn't want to score at the end i feel like i would have been bm if i scored one more time at that point once you've already missed the other opportunity but good first game though we do we have to do we have to do anything crazy at all and we ended up doing it well so get the next one see if we can keep it up get back to back dubs here see how it goes all right we're gonna sweat a game here too fast and mijo and faded on our team all right bloody one queuing is at 6 00 a.m right now so i'm surprised we're finding players that are actually really good not that our last lobby wasn't good but these guys are step uh above are the last guys we played for sure nice for mijo's a good touch nice good job to take our time there we have time with the advantage he didn't play into the spot he would have wanted to and i had a lot of time to take my shot pick a good touch on it instead of rushing it you know it's very easy to rush down that ball full speed i don't have to assess the situation realize where everyone's at right away you have more time than you think a lot of the time something that noticed ah not the best touch for my teammate but it happens i'm following the problem the challenge wasn't bad but because he didn't flip into any double jump he had no power because of that he's last man back and there's no way to get a situation after that i can't quite reach for shots i'll just wait should be fine works out in order to bump me at the hit the ball which is unfortunate smart to go for the bump there but unfortunate that leads to that situation for him it's a good touch still is a lot of time couldn't get the other boost though might still work out should take a time on this not shoot right away but it's okay let's open maybe take a touch first over good counter attack opportunity but again same situation double jumps into the the challenge so there's a lot less options a lot less ways to get the ball off of it if they do miss if i hit her over them i'm not going for a goal here quite yet better just dwindle them down a little bit look for a chance after the low boost in a worse situation play to myself play it high now i got the booster been perfect we're going to really apply for the night one of them a boost who would have still kept possession there should be fine nothing can really come with that yeah you're gonna beat me every time there it might be okay i could read i could touch to myself go for a flick here over one other one has to use all of his boosts now teammates should be okay as well all you can really do is pinch almost bad but works out fine it's a good challenge play challenge my teammate has to play this photo good job let's get attempts they're trying to follow up there good dog for me hold on taking this time i like that smart touch here a lot of these challenges honestly i don't even need to go for if i'm playing threes probably think a little bit harder about those challenges not going for them but and twos i tend to just autopilot a little bit and go forward every a lot of them i would i wouldn't normally go for because i don't think they're they're worth it i don't think the threat's high enough to warrant a challenge in a lot of these situations uh not quite fast enough maybe i could dunk them let's do a try i don't mind getting demo there puts me back in a good position as long as my teammate deals with this i'm lucky it's actually better to get a demo though where i was at there because i was no boost puts me back on 30 in a good spot to actually help him out how do you got to say maybe we have a counter there obviously a big question mark though on the save it's a hard thing to guarantee a saving a 1v1 like that we got it back though good job for my teammate no one cheated which is rare i don't like cheating every time so i decided not to that time but most times someone does at least that's a weird weird situation for sure a good passion my teammate i mean they're coming back very quick give me that first so i'm turning away from the ball because i don't want to be in a spot where i'm driving up too close that way like this i can back off turn and get a good challenge at least that's more more threatening i look like more of a threatening challenge than if my my position's ruined as soon as it gets over me right doesn't really have a way toward that net here all you can do is play it around for a bump it's fine got to play a shot here make it weird for them pick their boosts as well isotheras away now that touches either of them probably would have wanted you because you can't do anything with either of those touches so you win the next ball every time my time may dribble bump maybe timmy went for a bump it's actually could be really bad no reason to go for a bump when we have a goal lead like that to be honest but i like the oh my i like the attempt you know the aggression nah he's not backing down he doesn't care if we have a goal lead doesn't care if we have a three goalie he's gonna put the bump there you know i like that i like that anyway good game though the sweaty one for sure and we played pretty good for most part didn't have to do anything too crazy today all we had to do was play solid be in the right position and try to help our teammates out when we needed to and we did that for the most part so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video for today have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are watching this for the next video i'll try to do some 1v1 games because i haven't done that in a while so try to do some more video games for the next video love you see you on the next [Music] peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
