yo guys as you know we're trying to get rank once we're gonna be playing some twos for today hopefully we can keep it up play well we've been playing some really high ranked players and we're catching a lot of dubs so we gained a lot of points in the last like two or three days we're up like 60 or 70 points at this rate if we keep winning these big games important games we can get to rank one before we end the season even though there's not much time left but uh even then when next season comes around i'm definitely gonna try to get like very high leaderboards in all three game modes and stay there um this season i didn't play as much ranked as i wanted to i've been more focused on all these stuff like that but either way let's get into it and before we do quick message from today's

jump quick for this but also keep it controlled at the same time so i can follow it up put it around them to the right side could have been bad actually really ended up hitting out i had also played around into the corner i wasn't necessarily going for past my teammate more just looking for a way to play it like into space and also keeping pressure for us it's a really important thing to do and choose n3's look for touches that keep pressure oh he's pre-jumping okay that's something you only seen right this is a very risky play i should send okay yeah another not a very good free jump from him because even if he wins that ball and he's going that fast too it just gives my teammate a free ball and if he doesn't preach i'm probably going to regardless but not the best free jump that's the only kind of thing you'll see in rank that you'll never see in like pro games there's so much more on the line people play very different in ranked because of that there's really no uh consequence for here those kind of mistakes at least not necessarily like he's up for this again they're funny and he's not trolling either this is generally on people play in the highest rank which is very interesting to me this guy's taking all the boost it's really interesting i'm gonna play it back to my teammate i'm trying to fit them let my teammate go for me hopefully nice good fall up i jump to the wall here break the first touch bit off the back off my teammates probably a good pass should be able to get back maybe all right he's going for bomb on me interesting very weird game so far i don't really know what either side is doing to be honest i don't especially know what zero is doing it looks like he's trolling but he's definitely not it's just the way he plays i guess but it's just so weird very interesting got the boost so they're probably going to be very limited here i know that i don't panic too much i can just block my angle should have been fine probably but my teammate probably expect me to get over get the ball to get over me so okay yeah if they don't have a boost system like that like you know they don't have a boost you really don't have much to worry about kind of just like put a body up challenge and hope your teammate deals with the rest of it and if he does it's probably gonna be a goal for you but there are different situations in this game where like the ball slightly lag is not a challenge like it looks like something else is happening you just misread it wrong and that that's completely okay not a big deal at all it's just like quick so it's gonna bump me behind me i just gotta go off of that i knew he's gonna chase me down so gotta be speedy with my choice there regardless of what i do with the ball has to be quick so they can't get the bump on me before i make my play if you slow down too much there try to think too hard about what to do with it they're just going to bump you and you don't get a chance at all they can go backwards good enough there maybe hit forward to me it'd be good one more forward i said bump at this point can't really though i must not have been confident in this touch being good enough to me cut it over him should be a goal nice just playing to beat him there can't actually get a shot straight off of that and then it was enough to just beat him which is good all right good first game is actually solid uh solid recovery of things things were confusing so that's good since next one that's even keep it up get back to dubs see how it goes all right for the last game we got myself and sosa against shebex and eva okay this one again evil is very solid thousands really good as well let's see let's play for the boost here oh again this play is not going to be good he's just playing for the other corner boost how to force them away from the ball the challenge from so so this boot should be back in a second i still try to keep like a mental note of exactly when the dudes were taken so i can take advantage of it gotta go for a bump there nice good job i'm so awesome or start a bad touch from him that's like the main thing there obviously like in a 1v1 you're going to have the advantages to attack here most of the time so if you can at least make them get a bad touch your teammate can follow it up that's best case scenario first one i'm not going to go quick here i still have advantage in this situation don't quickly throw it away i'm just gonna let him hit this way it's fine give me shut up next touch get him on does it now they have free 1v1 now though for a long time just good any other flip nice yeah it's really hard for him to deal with at that point and i i honestly think that's way more on the first man like evo is way more at fault than she begs for not saving that because he left him in that situation being in these spots that he's being left in they're pretty much unsavable situations to be honest because even if you get the save it's gonna be followed up really quickly it's probably gonna be a goal as well i think the main thing and two is if you're trying not to leave your teammate and one v twos for too many times in a game like you only want like one or two 1v1 situations to happen in an entire game that's like best case scenario in a two's game i think and that's very rare a lot of time like right here i flipped over committed so my team is back and we'll go on for a while luckily it's not too dangerous of a 1v1 because he's forced up like wide but when someone's forced out that wide for a shot your your angle is so much less so much less that you can actually do with it from a corner like that and that'll take one of the one here if you position to like never leave your teammate alone for too long like a threatening situation they basically never get scored on in in twos should i play this to myself he's gonna beat me on the wall probably i just played for okay that was very ambitious from both of us i made a mistake just going for the shot there and sos is like you know whatever maybe maybe just maybe i could get you just blew over it it looks so troll but there's more on me as well because i'm first man there like i said i should be stalling in some way or just not full committing can't get back to this unfortunately it ended up missing should have been a goal for them though i'm not going to stay up i think it's going alone that's good so i know he's behind me here so again my goal is not to dive on this that's all eva wants for me to dab on this so if i can force him why get this boost now now he has zero sheba can't get any boost and if sosa can dunk him it's probably a good situation for us kind of like exactly what i was talking about there like i'm not trying to commit too much into the play so i don't leave sos in a bad spot where he's just forced to kill time for me whereas he can be confident in like making an aggressive play forward because he knows i'm behind him already i'm gonna play it around one and then fake this so you can hit it if you want to close this up already it's good i'm gonna wait again i'm last year place to hit it just over them and around them i'm gonna fake this make a panic a bit and already be behind sosa if he wants to go it's just going to be open kind of like i'm not gonna lie i feel like they were just giving up yeah he was just jumping around so i'm not sure if i should be trying really hard or not i feel bad it literally feels like they're trolling already but maybe they're just tilted or something yeah he's strong okay that's what i thought because he he hit it mid for me like he just passed it to me and then just stopped moving so i wasn't sure if i should score or not you dc'd all right that's game's over i'm probably gonna leave but they're both good players like evo you just got to spot an exit um so that's like you know they're expecting a lot of him he's an upcoming pro player technically so definitely a tough lobby to win it did a good job and uh see you guys all next video i don't have a lot of time right now so we'll cue again for another one soon but hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is watching this like comment and subscribe to see us on the next one i love you peace you
