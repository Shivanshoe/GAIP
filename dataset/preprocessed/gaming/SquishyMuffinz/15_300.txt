getting a little bit upset yeah but enjoy yoga so guys in a previous video we finished off at champey 3 division 3 we ended up losing it to a pro player and we had 11 50s on our team so it's pretty much unwinnable game but hopefully for these games it doesn't give us something that's too impossible to win because we're two game wins away man we're so so taped close let's get into it and hopefully we get the wins that we need alright we're going full charge load I believe you'd say in defending I believe we need this win let's get back to 1280 here hit that one step closer to GC my hair right side gonna be a little bit difficult for them to measure should go it's fine I can grab the boosts first come for a bump on me good follow up follow this as well hit it forward gonna kill this guy nice touch to follow close then you got to keep it in off the backward here nice finish you dope that still works it still worked really well alright we need this dub dude we need to keep that out this purse that you're there well what we did at that first 30 seconds keep it up just look for opportunities you have a nice flow deep ass when we can it's like to see gotta play smart right - you're on my team wall last guy back for a little bit I'm gonna wait that guy's probably first so I'll let up anything on ball going goal I'll just go forget such good 50 it's not gonna be a no thanks I can go for demo here really on the rotate out now take the boost pad line I'll be behind mission wish my team is to get behind me there now we go side off to the right side it's gonna be a world's worst flirt with the bang probably should get for that decent touch should have it pretty easily won't reach that you're on the way at least see me should go it's in the down field I'll just shoot my teammate gonna have rushed a little bit I've killed could be really bad good challenge good turn as well I got mid right boo this is intense dude this is sweaty I don't like how sweaty this is one mistake can cost the gaming that could have been the mistake from your tapes I gotta be more careful there we go never be to support yeah I'm just trying to hit this around them all I don't need to force anything we have the lead we're just trying to make them make mistakes here your job to get in the way at least I was go for the shine hit it over that guy it's gonna be a little bit awkward for release I should have decent gonna wait that's fun that'll do wait a patient enough did our job all day put this patient at over side bumped one should be enough that's fine it's gonna force the ball for my team nice you have for this quick over to should be a free goal good try I least like I didn't get it really good clear on that and then we've got a counter-attack Don I'll take that out chrome a nice flow to touch off the backboard again well my team is concern they're probably in a panic for that a little bit at least over this quick I've seen downfield create some pressure I'll leave now I think my teammates pushing forward with a lot of speed so I don't want to go over somebody's gonna mess them up there looks like a follow up on another one I just go for the beaten leave now for the bump as well kind of delayed the guy middle I could follow up that pass we could we could literally just went off this one goal if you don't make any mistake here fast I shot you let's go he's ready for that we're playing really well though I think I think we're doing we need to do this is perfect minute 31 we're set up for the win you set up for the win she need to keep it up I'll they just forfeit it well 100% take that we're back up through 12 81 now so we're exactly like probably six points away from grant chin so one more win if we get this one this is the game right here this can be the grain champ promotion game let's get this let's get this series done dude please don't give me a matchup against the pro that's just unwinnable please guys all right this is winnable this is actually winnable I think I don't know I don't know actually never mind I thought we're gonna know the team the other teams actually saw it I don't know about my teammates I'm fully honest yeah I haven't seen his yes play but they're Mars aren't terrible oh no that's good it's good actually almost four set a goal dude this is like make me more nervous and like our LCS crab funnels here why why my scenarios for this I want to win so bad I just know what I have to do this anymore off the wall the wall is literally big over here know if she got to she really good read you should leave this for me first down this he's blocking you I shouldn't have been free jumping that but it's fine they both went really bad for us she better get there so it's you into a kind of free jump I don't know why they're both free jumping and everything a little bit sketchy to be honest but let's hope for the best here it's not lose faith quite yet this play like slightly slower to somebody be a game filled with opportunities feel like off the back floaty as well close then I can go for it run again off the back nice and floaty open I'm gonna get back so many chances are ready man other thing I should have been there open again so many chances man this is the one we got a win I believe I should go or not do no dude you may see me serious today holy like I don't know how that happens how does it even turn to almost against us out of your back they make a mistake man this has to be the game we win here playing back playing patient it's gonna be the most hype go ever I'm trying to stay close on this I'm not banging that hard to them teammates are kind of like to post each other though these last four plays open so close man this goal will be so high please backward backward you just a little bit closer with your goals for us probably no not like this please don't miss you actually missed anyway you got the touch these 90 me back for so long please don't mess up I believe I saw they don't but I do kind of awkward for them you gotta make this awkward as possible for the defense and hopefully my teammates can get it opening here it'll so close all right I'll stand this it's gonna do I'll do that's fine let me should go next nice round one I'm gonna go back and get back quick should I hit it across I love any boost I should take I'll take this one nice I'm back here so hard for them three wide open no dude come on team I believe we got this this is the one we gotta win do you want a chance like this again seems so winnable our one teammate good touch please no do you just gotta bang that away and that's what too risky I like that faith one unto you you may know over Chris oh my god I'm losing I'm loosing on my hair how have you not scored I'm losing all my hair I'm so stressed out please team just one of these Internet's Sen ago team in one of them to on backwards good sorry guys this is bad commentary I'm just stressed rightfully so on his last Oh No can you play it safe here you should be behind me by now I just hate going for the first challenge I don't like leaving them back and don't fully trust they'll be saving stuff go for me nice that's a huge challenge actually oh god no hey it's a lucky please and you get touch here nice passes it close come on what do you guys got a clutch up I believe did it go nice giving it pressure out of this we need me to make pressure of this missile ball you guys should go oh no dude lost for so long yeah I definitely miss middle on how I can actually touch I want I'll take this from them off the back how do you believe it you miss teammates just so far back every time he's never gonna score that they did it like that team is not like free jumping every single ball would probably score so many of these I don't know there please the other team II know please go for the ball dude oh my god I can't do this guy's I really can't no nice be holy what is that no don't kill me please dude I can't do this no dude what can I wear could I do that game honestly honestly what more can I do this feels so impossible guys this is the most frustrating thing I've ever had to beg

frustrating we're back down oh my lord whatever it's fun well we'll play it the next video we need to get to win still the same situation still stands hopefully we can do it I don't know man it's
