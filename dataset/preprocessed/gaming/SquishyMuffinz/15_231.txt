far and hope you guys enjoyed today's video love y'all yo what's up guys so i haven't done a training pack video in a while so i decided to do one for today i'm gonna be going over stuff that will help you with your consistency so these are four packs that were linked to me by my friend gyro who used to play for pittsburgh knights but he's currently on the team the peeps in the rlcs very good player super solid consistent player all around so you know this stuff works and i asked him what kind of training packs he used he sent me these four codes i'll put the code down below in the description but i'll be going over all four of these packs in this video and uh yeah i'll be going through them quick but they're all very useful for this consistency in general and if you practice these packs every single day i guarantee your game will improve slowly but for sure it will improve all right so let's get into the first one we'll go over the awkward clears pack which was made by gyro himself so let's get straight into it i haven't played this yet so to be 100 first time playing it but it's pretty much all trying to read really awkward backwards stuff that happens a lot in high level pro play so if you're a player who is low ranked this is something that's good to practice just to get a hold of how to control your car in the air so we're going to start off and we'll go through the pack so one tip i will give for those is when it is awkward like that and you are coming from the same direction as the ball is coming from turn off ball cam for a second it'll help you kind of get a better idea where you are behind the ball and help you get a better read on it that's why that read looks so easy to make the way i jump for that because i can know exactly where the ball is going this is a tough one but you got to be patient in a game like this you got to wait for the first bounce and then you jump as soon as you kind of read where it's going to end up you want to jump as soon as you have an idea of where that final bounce is going to make the ball go so here these are one of the roll down shots i like to wait until i have an idea where it's going or if it's a really intense situation they're coming in quick i'll go off the top and you can get a counter attack maybe even a shot out of it maybe even a pass out of that so that's a really good way to go for those as well it's a good thing to try to practice all right so for these it's all about just getting a good read on it so i like to float a little bit floating makes it a lot easier to have time to react to the bounce that way you're not trying to fully read where the ball is going to end up super quick because if you go really quick to this ball it's a lot harder to read where it's going to end up right so i might just completely whiff like this if i go super fast or get a bad hit but if you float you have an idea of where it's going to go and you can get a good touch i was actually able to pretty much score that ball if that was an actual game so that's all just being patient and floating you don't need to go quick to this because most of the time they're gonna be waiting on your miss in a situation so just make sure you float and you'll probably get there first regardless if someone's going really quick to this then it's all about speed and you want to get any kind of touch on the ball like that's fine if someone's going to because you're just trying to stop that right all depends on the situation but you want to be able to do both for the next one it's going to have back wall this is really awkward so in game if there's no one going i'll wait for the dribble there's no one going for this in game you want to take your time and don't panic you know try to get a dribble or get a good pass to your teammate whatever it may be because you know if no one's going you might be able to have a teammate on the left side and you just bang it over to him and they can get a double tap or something off of that if you gotta go really quick to this it's super tough to read it's coming at such an awkward angle but there's definitely like a lot of different ways to go about a situation like this but honestly in the game a shot like this is going to be so hard for them to get a good shot of this i would just wait way back here this shot's going to be a week and you're most likely going to have an easier clear after the fact don't waste a lot of boost for something like this and if you are you know just move out to it and dribble that's the only only thing i'd recommend doing on a shot like that in game it's still a good thing to practice going up for it because it's awkward though it seems like another roll down one and there we go we got it off the top it was super awkward it's the first time i saw that bounce and those are always weird to read in game and they do come that fast they do happen to come that fast in high level play so it's just something you have to practice so for this one you're in a super awkward spot you gotta wait for the bounce but i like to just float on this again the same situation because if you wait too long here look where the ball bounces out and i can't really jump for this someone's already gonna be up for that and probably score so as soon as i see it going awkward i'll float and i'll have so much time to react to where it's gonna go right so just jump float and that helps you read any of these awkward bounces because you're already in the air as long as you know the general direction you can get there but if you wait too long look how long it takes me to get to this ball and then they're probably going to get there first right so you want to just kind of jump up to the general area you think it's going to go and then you get a touch that's my recommendation for those awkward corner bounces you'll be seeing me do that a lot something like this i don't even know what this bounce is yet i'm gonna pre-jump early and i kind of know where it's gonna go i know the the general area so i could just keep floating and in the game if you do get a really good touch and you have full boost you can even stay on this ball and get a 50 50 right i don't have the uh opportunity on this because it just appears but you can see the idea right if you go pretty quickly that's what i would do i would take a second i wouldn't pre-jump it and i would get the read off the bounce it all depends on the situation again if you're going for the quick clear you have the position very different but if you go for just a straight up read then the the floating technique is very good to make sure you do hit that ball consistently every single time it's something you'll see a lot of pro players doing this is very awkward again i'm going to float again i know the general area has it to the side there we go that's going to stop any danger for a little bit because it's clear to the corner always kind of clueless to the corner and the same situation super awkward bounces going off wall-to-wall but you want to just flip that's the best way to defend that this is a really awkward one and um like even i kind of struggled to deal with that first time seeing it and the game you don't really want to go for this because look how much panic there is involvement i don't see anything that's happening on this this whole side of my screen right this whole time look at where my ball cam is i don't see anything that's happening in front of me they can challenge me at any time during that it's probably a goal so you want to turn off your ball cam i'd say you can see the field better in that situation but i wouldn't really go for this again same situation as before wait for the shot and you can react and get a hit to the side in the game but it's not bad to practice getting a weird read on this as it is really awkward and i can't even get a really good hit on this that's probably the best that i do in a game in that situation it's just really awkward you don't want to have to be jumping for that ball like that's so risky i feel like in a game but it's fine it's a good thing to practice still it's going down and we could take our time on this i'd go for like an air dribble no one's really going to be super close to this and if they are then you you can go quick and just get a boom and this is one that in a game if you have the time to try to get a boom to a specific spot of the field if you see a teammate on the right side boom to the right wall if you see team on the left side try to get around it even though it is hard and try to boom it over to the left side of the field that's the best i could have got it but you know what i mean that's the whole idea of it try to practice getting a good touch and if there's a lot of time and you think there's no threat at all just dribble take your time and make a play forward flick over one maybe maybe get a double tap you know stuff like that just practice that stuff this is one you have to read really quick off the wall i had to jump really early for these because the ball is going super fast you're just matching the speed of the ball and predicting how it'll bounce off the back wall it's something that takes time and a lot of experience so it's not something that's gonna come easy you can't really do the floating thing he's gotta float super far out for this and it's just really hard to read so it's something that i think is better to try to match the the pace of the ball and you can get a much better hit off it if you do it properly so that's that's my whole recommendation if the ball is going fast straight off the wall straight back off the wall match the speed of the ball this is a really awkward one but the floating technique will prevail in every situation like this because if you just go quick to this look how hard it is for me to read this i still got a really good touch somehow i don't know how i was supposed to miss that for an example but going faster this is almost always going to be worse because like i pretty much own gold although i did it on purpose at the end there i pretty much own gold because i was going too fast to it so the floating technique is always going to be better and you can even try to get it over to a specific side so i could try to get this off to the right side obviously this situation is really awkward you don't ever want to be positioned like this so it's something you want to avoid doing all together but if you do end up in this position you want to be able to be comfortable enough and confident enough that you can call to your teammates if you are playing higher level lobbies that you want to hit this to the right you want to say the left that way they know early so jumping for this and just knowing what you want to do with the ball early is a huge huge advantage to have over other players but that one's really tough really tough one to practice now this one's really awkward and it happens a lot in game that would have been a double tap to the corner would have been safe this is one that you have to just practice because it comes with speed at you and it's a very awkward bounce these bounces that come skimming in off the off the corners like this are really tough so that's one you just have to keep practicing over and over again and like you can see me right here i'm messing it up a couple times it's a tough one and in game i wouldn't want to be in this position because it's just really awkward you have to jump super quick to it and you're not going to get the best touches right so i wouldn't really want to go for this bowl unless i absolutely have to and most of the time someone's not going to be there that quick for this so i can take my time i'd probably honestly just dribble it and again because no one's really going to be there no one's going to be pre-jumping this ball it's coming in too fast for it to be too threatening um but again it's a training pack so you want to practice the idea at hand but again the positioning that gyro put the cars in for this training pack it's purposely awkward that way you you get used to being able to save stuff in those positions you want to be positioned here for this because if you're positioned here you can react to this so easily and get a really good clear right but if you're positioned here look how look how much you have to do to get to this ball you have to like break your neck to even have a chance to touch this ball and then it's not going to be a good touch so your positioning has to be a lot better than what this pack shows obviously in high level play but still a really good pack that's the first one we'll go over that's the end of that one so we'll go into shooting consistency this one is 20 shots is the longest pack the next one's 14 and then eight so it's going to be a decently long video but let's get into the second pack i'll go over these ones really quick i haven't played any of these by the way but they're all pretty basic shots and my tip for shooting guys i always try to hit it with the corner of your car i'll try to just zoom through these ones but i always try to hit it with the corner of your car and don't try to use too much boost that way you can follow up another play if the opponent does save it you can follow up the next play so in these packs i recommend trying to practice you know using a little as little amount of boost as possible and you know not just going for just straight up shots too go for a double tap addition right there try out the back wall to yourself and just just see what you can do you know i mean just practice as many mechanics as possible slow down pass yourself off backwall go for a shot stuff like that you know there is so much creative stuff you can do in rocket league don't limit yourself to just this because in a game just that is not gonna work especially against really good players so slow down get a fake in there pop it high you know do some weird stuff and just just practice your mechanics just get better at the game don't limit yourself to one shot don't limit yourself to one simple thing right and also throw in in a pack like this maybe some passes practice like there's someone to your right here just get one pass over to the right by pass low try to pass it really high try to just get a really soft touch to the right i don't know just practice different ways to pass so you have all these things in your arsenal just practice like flicking it to the moon or teaming behind you give yourself a lot of options right know how to do all these things if you need to do them in game it's really good really good useful stuff to have in your arsenal or just be able to shoot it like that if it's wide open you know you want to be able to hit those shots at least 9 out of 10 times but the whole idea of this one is just a practice shooting obviously that's the the name of the pack shooting consistency so any any any way you want to practice that up to you any mechanic you want to practice up to you but try to imagine scenarios when you're doing these packs try to imagine that there's you know people around you and you're trying to beat them to the ball stuff like that would have been a good shot this is a good one to practice your corner double taps even though it's probably not what it's intended for at all but it's a really good one to practice that this is a really awkward one so this is okay this isn't a scenario that you're trying to rotate out it gets hit off back wall you have to turn around this is a good one to practice to be able to you know control your car to get that in i would jump it roll the other way and then it's going to flip down probably the best way to do this the most accurate most consistent way to do this you could double jump to it and maybe go for like a air dribble or something if there's someone and go i would recommend going for a double and practicing that or just like an air dribble or something honestly i like practicing i like using this as like a a defense situation this is an awkward situation on defense that's hard to get out of and it'd be good good one to practice honestly not not a bad one both ways to shoot or to you know practice defending as well it's a good shot so it's coming at you that's a really hard hit to get on octane for me sometimes because sometimes the the car will just die it's a really good one to practice getting a good touch on octane it's a good shot so we got to reach this one i'm guessing it's a cut and then just boom it you can do whatever you want with that again if you really want to you can pretend there's more people here do a cut do a cut again get fake fake again fake it again and then shoot i don't know you could like to pretend there's people make a scenario up in your head and act like you know you're getting around people you're going to pass to someone but you practice passing like this take the first guy take it to the side you know take your time pretend there's someone middle and just pop it middle yeah you mean just stuff like that just pretend like it's a game scenario and that'll help you be more ready for those scenarios in game even if it is you're just making something up in your head right that's what i do for these packs anyway i pretend like the scenario's happening in game what i would do in this situation that was a really good flick i don't know why that was so fast but yeah this one just seems like a breakaway opportunity with a 101 you just got to try to be consistent at scoring it it's a good one to practice i'll just pop this one high probably in a game it'll be awkward for them and then you probably have a free goal in most scenarios as long as no one's on back wall but i'm assuming someone's ground here and it's got a bad touch so i'll just wait and you need to jump for these balls a big thing like in game yet i remember is if they have their ball cam on it's going to be really awkward for them when the ball's above their head because look at the muzzle of my head here look what i see right what do i see when it's right above me nothing in front of me at all so try to imagine that that's why i turn around ball cam at the right times is very useful it's a very good thing to know when to do yeah i try to imagine that in game helps with a lot of situations like right here the balls above their head most time you need to go you can just wait and then it'll probably be the same thing as if you went and mostly in most cases it'll be the same thing just to redirect the teams hit it off back wall follow it up myself or you can practice passing to a teammate that's a cross product is getting a weird redirect following yourself again but yeah there's a lot of different things you can do with this pack every single shot you can try to practice it as if it's a different scenario that's what i like about it let's take a shot bardowskis wasn't barred down he's close go for a double try does the awkward double reads again passing middle yeah it's a really good really good pack all around just for practicing getting good hits and even just passes across every single one of these you can pass instead of shooting which is a really good thing to practice i think it's a underrated skill to practice being able to hit the ball with different corners of your car to pass we have the flip couldn't quite get it i'd probably go for this in a game like this here at the bottom of my car try to use my flip to score and i am messing it up and that's why i need to practice it i would like to get this to the point where i could score like every single time but i'm messing it up a couple times right but that's okay that's how you improve i don't know why i'm missing it every time but you learn by just doing it over and over again i'm still hitting it the same way every single time so i'll do it until i score the same way this is a very scorable shot in game though like this is something that can actually really work because the defense probably won't expect you to have your flip i got it there but i want it better i did it again there we go all right now i could probably get it way more often that's what i mean so i i realized what i was going wrong i already adjusted where i was going wrong and i could do it every single time so that's the whole idea of these packs you just saw me approve right there i literally just improved while you guys were watching me and i just hit the same shot four times in a row so i messed it up four times but you saw me literally fix it as i went on and improved as you went this is a good one practice situation where you gotta get around that ball quick you gotta do a really quick flip here and it's got a good shot i think if you flip normal i don't know if you can get there it's really tough but the speed flip helps a lot there we go it's a good one to practice just the calm cool collected finish take a shot from mid you're telling someone's there beat him to it past middle so many different things all these shots be creative with it it's the whole point of this video i wanted to tell you guys i wanted to remind you guys there's so many good packs out there you know don't be afraid to look for them search for them there's always an updated like browse section with a lot of really good facts and it can help you guys a lot especially if you use them the right ways use them in ways where you feel like you're actually noticing improvements like that one pack that one shot i just did i feel like i noticed an improvement right away i can hit that shot in the game but i wasn't hitting it there for some reason and then i realized what i was doing wrong i fixed it i was sitting every single time that's the point of these packs for improvement right this is a really good one this is such an awkward read that's my first try at it my second try this is the same thing as the defensive ones for any fast backboard we just float a bit more you have more time for the ball to come to you and you have more time to react to the shot itself how much time i have for the ball to come to me there i mean a lot of these octane touches that just aren't going where i think they should be going there we go yeah the floating thing is super op for any backboard read the feathering boost of floating that's the whole point of feathering your boost it helps you float a little bit more instead of going super quick if i hold my boost the whole time a lot harder to hit this shot it's me holding the whole time i still hit it but it's way better if you just float way more consistent in game and i'll probably go in way more often that's the last shot of that pack and we'll get into the third of four here that was the longest pack the next ones are going to be pretty short so this one is called this one is called redirects v1 really good basic redirect practice and i'm just gonna shoot all these really quick and um yeah redirects are something that you don't see as much in high level play like these these kind of redox won't really happen as much in high level play anymore because people cut them out really easily but it's still a good thing to practice your consistency you want to be able to hit it almost every single time and that's a tough one the ball is coming at you fast hard to get power back toward the net good thing to practice this is a good one to go for a double tap this could work in a game still i'd say if you hit it properly it's a zero second double tap i didn't realize really awkward really really awkward one especially because i'm going quick as if there's someone challenging me in game yeah that's a good shot this is a really really good pack okay i'm trying to go for a wood redirect on this one but you don't need to again the floating thing is massive with honestly any shot if you take your time and you float instead of just you know rushing it if i go as quick as possible shall i go harder just for me to get this i'm not if i'm not stop boosting the whole time it's so much harder right oh my god that was actually insane what the heck why they go so fast 90 miles per hour skim top corner no spin at all on the ball but if you float you have so much time to react you can get the shot every single time so the floating shot is literally the strap for anything aerial based it's so it's so good it's super underrated people think you need to go as fast as possible all the time you don't it's honestly better if you slow down a lot more more often than not yeah all these are just pretty pretty basic but difficult at the same time high level double taps it's really a practice so even if you are lower rank it'll help you learn a lot i think and um you know even if you can't them right away you can hit very variance of what i'm doing you're not going to hit what i'm doing right away but you can definitely hit variance of what i'm trying to do or even just a you know a lower level version of just a shot doesn't matter it doesn't need to be perfect double tap but slowly get yourself up there and this pack gives you a lot of options again the float there helps me just get around the ball perfectly instead of just boosting the whole time look how little boost i use at the end there i float float and i get the perfect shot i'm just gonna float again get up to where the ball is gonna end up where you think it is and then just take a shot at the end that's that's my way of thinking about it elevate yourself to the point where the ball is going to be at its peak and then just float so you can get the final hit on the ball that's the whole idea of nailing like these awkward angle redirects obviously you can go as quick as possible to it like this is me just flying because i can it is way tougher it's doable but it's way tougher to get a good angle on it right but if you just float try to aim it you'll get it in much more realistic way to shoot it this is a really awkward one it comes right at you weed get out the back wall go for a triple there we go i didn't meet a ball cam on there i would go for the flipping set off my car on this this is a this is such a good opportunity to do this in game this would work every time too like if no one's on back wall for their team at this point they're screwed if you can get the flip right here they're pretty much screwed you have so much space to shoot wherever you want to the only way they're saving this is if they pre-jump perfectly which is not gonna happen in most cases this is a really good one to practice these uh double tap flip resets off the wall such a difficult mechanic though to get down perfectly i've hit some of these in like some pro games and they're literally some of the cleanest shots to hit i swear something that i'm like steadily practicing trying to get better at you'll see me doing it a lot that's a really good angle yeah the zero second timer on this too makes you that extra level of consistent i feel like on this stuff once you practice it enough because you're not hitting the ball at the ground if the ball's bouncing before it goes in most likely the defender is going to save that so it makes you that extra bit more consistent let's get into the last shot and it's another double tappable one i would also go for the the bottom of the car double on this because you have a lot of time to react to the second hit i feel like if you get the right size like that's perfect you have so much time to get a bang on goal so that's something that needs to be positioned perfect for though for it to work all right let's get to the last pack though i think this is one of the the shortest ones yeah this is the shortest one i think eight shots in this one it's called devo it's just double taps and again you can go these any way you want but uh the biggest thing about doubles is floating to that first touch to get control and then you can stop boosting for a bit and just float again so the floating thing is pretty much abusable in any time you're aerating any time you're aerialing you can do the float and uh it'll help you a lot and just getting more accurate with your doubles you'll see me doing on every single shot in this pack and how much it helps me be consistent and i can show you the difference on this shot i'll go quick the whole time i boost the whole time look how much less accurate i am i'm not gonna stop boosting the whole entire time it's so hard to get the perfect shot on this and the amount of boost i'm wasting is actually crazy so if i float if i take my time get a good touch float and try to actually shoot the second one you have so much more time to react so much more time to place your shot it's actually it's crazy how much more useful it is to just float or take your time on a shot like this instead of just wasting all your boost you're also saving boost too which is perfect you always want to be actively trying to save your boost right the only time i hold my boost is if i'm too far below the ball i need to boost it above it it's the only situation where i'll actually hold my boost in a spot like this i'll go for the off the stomach double i'll try i want to get one here it's really difficult one to get it off but this is a really tough one i want to get it perfect hold on i might hit once there we go i was good that was good that was solid but the same thing it's a lot of floating trying to get a perfect touch i don't fully boost the entire time right it's a lot of just choosing the times to boost the right times oh i'm gonna try to get two out of this hold on idea i have a really good idea i don't know if it's gonna work though it's hard no i'm not gonna build it yet never mind i had an idea but maybe it's too difficult more difficult than i think you're gonna flip sometimes out of that that's the hard part about it you don't really know if you're gonna get a flip oh okay that's kind of my idea but i messed it up so you float a little slower one off the back wall tap it again and then use your flip that's actually a nuts shot actually such a good shot i wanna try to get one like that look how much i'm floating though on a shot like this actually crazy how much i'm floating to get the perfect hit oh i don't know if i have a flip it's so hard to tell if you get a flip out of this is that there we go that was decent you could do a lot more with a different angle on the ball it was coming at a different angle that's really good you'd probably beat another defender there by not shooting  off of that you can get a really good far angle shot to the side doubles close that's my favorite shot to go for right now in these packs very good thing to practice yeah all these shots guys are all really really good practice there's none of these shots none of these shots are bad for you to practice they're all really good in game and um they'll help you a lot trust me if you're even a newer player you don't know how to aerial yet this will help you just learn how to ariel and just read the the game in general you'll start reading bounces earlier than other people because you're practicing them earlier but yeah all these links will be in the description guys we got one more shot and then that's gonna be here for this video but yeah this one is just a very same thing you're reading the ball simple and you just go for the shot yeah floating to a ball like this in game so big for getting good control on it because you don't want to just throw away the ball right away so just float get a good touch off the back wall take your time and try to finish off the shot that's the biggest thing for all these take your time after you get your first touch you have more time to react to where the ball is going to bounce to you don't even need a boost after your first touch for a bit as long as you're on track with the ball you don't need to boost only boost if you're too high above or below it those are my biggest tips for double taps and for this pack in general because this pack is all double taps but yeah hope you guys enjoyed it's the last shot of the pack and last shot of the four all four packs will be down below in the description i appreciate y'all thank you so much for 850 000 subscribers we're only 150k away from one mil and it's very doable before the end of the year so thank you so much for making that a possibility that'll be enough to finish off 2020. a year that hasn't been good by any means by reaching one meal that would be actually ridiculous to think about thank you so much guys i love you guys i hope you guys have a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment subscribe and see us on the next one i love y'all peace you
