brand new here and you do enjoy this video after watching it please make sure you do go down below and press that subscribe button i appreciate every single one of you you guys are the absolute best and i hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo what's up guys i promise i'll make this video in a previous one i said if you guys wanted to in the comments i'd make a double flip recent tutorial and a lot of you guys in the comments down below if that video said that you'd be down for it so today we're gonna be doing the double flip reset tutorial now you know how to do one flippy set obviously to be able to do two so if you don't know how to do one yet make sure you do practice that first because you're not gonna have any chance of getting two if you don't know how to do one and you're also gonna need to know how to do flip cancels those are the two things i recommend you learning to do properly so we like to use the wall to air dribble pack here which is by ip joker i believe that's the one that i use to practice this when i first tried it the first thing you wanted to do obviously is the basic flip reset so hit the ball off the wall and just get a flip and try to just flip you don't need to try to score off of it or anything but just try to get the flip that's the main thing you should be going for at the start that should be the first step now what i will say straight off the bat is that you should break right here separate yourself from the ball a bit and that'll make your flippy set easier that's one way off the wall that your flippy cell will be way easier it separates you from the ball a little bit and it helps a lot in general just getting the flip that you want and you want to be matching the speed of the ball that should be the two things that you should uh focus on when you're going for one flip reset and that's two right that's an example of two so after you get one this is the hard part that's actually really difficult to practice because you have to just understand how flip cancels work so the next step is getting an understanding of how to get the proper flip cancel so you obviously need to know how to flip cancel in general to do this but what i would recommend is practicing in steps so pop out the wall get a reset level your car out and the practice is doing a diagonal flip and see what you can do from there so pop it off get a reset level your car back forward and then go for a diagonal flip and see if you can get the cancel so if you guys don't know what a flip cancel is it's just pulling your stick back in the opposite direction that you're flipping so that's what a half flip is you're back flipping and then pulling upward um you can do it forward and that's exactly what i'm doing i'm doing the reverse of a half flip but forward so that diagonal flip cancels just this that's how i end up it's a half flip but i end up forward and that's i'm doing midair so you got to practice doing that and that's the really hard part for for newer players especially because they don't have a good grasp of flip cancels in general or the timings of it so learning how to do them in steps is is massive but yeah that's what i would recommend doing in steps is that pop off hitting one reset leveling out and getting the diagonal flip perfectly underneath the ball those are things you should practice over and over again and you chain them all together and you'll be able to get multiple flip resets now that's all you want to practice just keep on going for the ball the same three steps level out go for the flip and just keep on getting flips if you can get as many as possible that's really good practice the more you go for in a single run that's really good just learning how to control your car in the air so yeah my opinion it's uh one of the harder mechanics to learn but those are the so yeah my opinion it's one of the harder mechanics to learn for sure but it's not one that's impossible to learn and you don't need to be a crazy high rank to be able to know how to do this this isn't something that you should focus on necessarily because it's honestly very like difficult to do even for pro players so i think if you're lower rank this isn't something you should try in your games very often because you shouldn't even be able to know how to do this yet um and you probably won't have the boost or just the general like game sense to get yourself in a position where you can pull this off because the ball should be going perfect speed up the wall and then the ball has to be going perfectly close to your card every single touch so it's a very tough thing to do but for those of you that want to try and you're a higher rank or you're lower ranking just want to give it a shot you know definitely give it a try in training i think even though i have the skill in my arsenal i don't use it very much in uh in games because especially people at my rank they challenge so well that by the time i try to go for my first flip these days if you do this go for your first flip biggest challenge so you can't even do that really so knowing how to do this isn't even that useful for very high ranks anymore um but honestly it's something that's just fun to practice i like to try to learn every possible mechanic in the game see that's why i'm showing you guys this um but all i would say is guys the biggest thing for this is knowing how to do your your diagonal flip cancel forward you do it left as well i don't do it left i do it right naturally that's how i feel comfortable spinning that and just knowing how to get consistent flip resets that's really good and also your first touch off the wall guys in my opinion the first touch on any play is the biggest thing that'll help you first touches on air dribbles gets you that space to be able to follow and do what you want the first touch on like a pre-flip interior dribble type thing it's extremely important as well because if you don't get a good first touch you can actually follow it up like this right if your first touch is just flying away from you like this i can't even do like a really bad first touch anymore because the muscle memory i was trying to get a bad one there but if it's just flying away from you and or you just miss it like that you know you can't really do anything that's not a very good one because it's so hard to follow it up and get a good touch right so just first touches in general it'll help you out massively honestly just practicing this and going for a good first touch that'll help you with air dribbles i think it's to help you with other things it's a good thing to practice for that reason i think it'll help you with your general just game sensing mechanics so yeah the first touch really is um a really underrated thing when it comes to anything on the wall in my opinion like the first session this is almost everything if you get a really bad first touch you can't even follow it because if it hits the ceiling like you can't actually go for the shot what i would like to see though guys is after watching the tutorial how many of you guys are actually able to pull this off so i would like to see you guys grind this out and you know tweet videos at me my twitter is at squishy muffins tweet clips of me of you guys doing a double flippy set for the first time because of this video i would like to see i would love to see how many you guys actually learned from it and actually gain knowledge from this video but yeah i would say everything i went over with the main tips all you guys should need to actually pull off a double flipper set successfully like i said guys don't get down to yourself if you can't pull this off because it's one of the hardest mechanics in the game and just try to break it down in your head guys don't make it so overwhelming if you think of the whole thing as one action like oh i'm just going to do a double flipping step i think if the whole thing has one big action it's just going to be a lot harder in your head just try to dumb it down for yourself go up pop it off the wall jump for it get one reset level yourself out get a diagonal flip and then go for the shot right just level it out don't try to don't try to make it all one big action try to split it up into little things and it'll make it a lot simpler in your head try to perfect each individual step before going into the big picture right look at the in-betweens but yeah that's what i'm doing personally when i'm trying to practice something like this or any kind of mechanic that's um very difficult in general or very like filled with steps i try to just break it down so like i said i'll pop it up focus on that get control first and then i'll go for my flick at the end right try to break it into little pieces rather than trying to focus on the big picture as soon as i start thinking of oh i gotta jump with it as soon as i gotta get a perfect touch i gotta do this this this this this it makes it so much more difficult try to make it as easy as possible on yourself and just split it up into the simple steps yeah that's pretty much gonna be it for this video guys i don't have much else to tell you it didn't have to be a long one i just needed to give you guys the basic tips and it really comes down to you guys just putting the time in to learn the mechanics of the game and what's the best way to do everything and once you do get good at it you can actually throw it in with like ceiling shots i've gotta go like this in game where you fake the ceiling shot get a second flip you can get a shot like that so i'm just doing the same kind of idea level out you'll see me level up right here and i just flip at the end get the flip off a bit then i have a second flip so it's also kind of a double flip reset type thing you're gonna flip off the ceiling i can follow it up like that so a lot of different things you can do with this guys keep on practicing like i said let me know if you guys do end up getting goals with this i don't think you guys will score in a game very often because it is a very tough one to score in general but let me know what you guys can get in training if you guys do figure it out but yeah that's going to be pretty much all for this one guys like i said i hope you did enjoy the video if you want to see any other specific mechanics i don't want to drag on like a tutorial video longer than it needs to be so like i said just let me know down below and i'll try to make the videos as quick as possible and i won't drag them on long during the video i always try to give you guys just the basic idea of the mechanic and i try to give you guys everything you need to learn it and then you have to put the work in yourself because there's only so much i can do and you can learn from just watching you have to get on the game and put in the work but i gave you guys all you need learn a simple flip reset learn how to do a good first touch learn how to level yourself out after the first flip reset get a good diagonal front flip cancel which is just the complete opposite of a reverse half lift so regular half flip so you're gonna do that forward just flip cancel it diagonally and then get back under the ball and try to go for a flip off of that so yeah that's pretty much all you're gonna do just put that up dumb it down for yourself don't make the big picture so scary in your head and yeah best of luck guys at me on twitter at squishy bubbles make sure you drop me a follow there as well we're almost at 160 000 followers over there so if you guys can get me to that that would be nuts and make sure you do drop a subscription down below if you're not subscribed to the channel if you did enjoy the tutorial i hope i wasn't as in-depth as i could have been for this guys it's hard to go into each individual mechanic especially with something like this because you really just have to have a feel for it and it's hard to just simply explain with words just have to get on the game and you have to try it over and over again it's only going to get better at it yeah love you guys thank you for everything you're the absolute best to see on the next [Music] peace you
