brand new video enjoy today's video guys yo what's up guys so i opened up rocket league and this is what i see rlcsx major finalist titles i didn't know they were going to give this but they gave titles up for the major final so that's pretty sick and rls is x regional champion because we did win the regional as well and ours is x original finalists because we also got the finals and lost unfortunately in the finals of a regional as well so we've won a regional lost in two finals of regionals we've lost as well in the finals of a major so those are what those titles are from so we've gone that close to winning that many things we've come that close we've actually won one as well so we're not doing too bad by any means major finalist regional champion original finalist so we'll use arlinson's x regional champion for today major finalists looks pretty clean as well but obviously the king of all titles the world champion title pretty hard to beat that no matter what it may be but also x titles are pretty damn clean of course just having the x in there just looks sick in my opinion i'm gonna be playing some twos with dapper for today old friend of mine and x pro player should be some good games let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right running into forkey and where is paco here for the first game you can catch some dubs back to back hopefully for today we'll see we'll see go for the bump here show off the bat and get a lot of pressure put him in an awkward spot make him waste his boost you make him panic all right just behind the ball he's gonna panic pretty hard most of the time that's what most people do good shot from us good placement there we go i used four boosts in that shot and it went perfectly top corner we'll 100 take that that is for sure take those top corner shots especially the low boost ones that you can get them that pretty much everything blocked it's really good boost spawn for us as well so here for the bump on the back wall i always try to make the life as difficult as possible in a situation j like if you can bump someone to make their time that much harder always go for it that's me on the right wall you go for the bump again i know i couldn't get a good shot of that there's almost no way the ball is too low i would have to wrap around the ball absolutely perfectly for anything good to come out of that so i try to go for the bump maybe last second to help up my teammate close is going to be top corner look like as well not a bad idea on the shot there if i touch forward he beats me it's fine honestly it's more so about blocking the goal angle making sure you can't get a direct shot at least making him have to like show his hand early i'd feel you fake there so any single jumps it's fine again he's flipping really aggressively into a lot of these balls that aren't really worth doing that for so we'll always we'll always take that in those situations because again i made him kind of over commit he's left back with no boost dapper gets a free ball i don't mind a situation at all even if he wins that challenge diving as aggressively as he is my teammate the end of the day gets the ball right try to just slot one home so to go for a bump there couldn't quite i gotta wait for dapper to get back i don't want to over commit here leave him in a bad spot so i'll leave that ball for him now i know it's gonna be free for him leave him in a good spot with ball possession and we never really left our goal at risk either had every option covered again dapper should be okay here unless something unlucky happens it almost did my challenge is like it's good and bad it's bad because i land all the way in there half it's good because it forces them to go high and give zapper a pretty ball that's pretty decently easy to work with to be honest i thought i don't mind driving into that dribble there because more often than not they're going to go for a a challenge that's going to be beneficial to us i'd say we're getting pretty heavily pressured but until they actually control this ball and slow down probably not going to get anything out of this or look for a quick pass zapper should be back that's really a flick from them good play good job to slow down like i said as soon as they actually slow down as soon as they take control of the ball instead of just booming it away or rushing and panicking they're actually not gonna get anything going but if they take time and actually try to make a play out of the balls that they have at the session that they do have it'll do more for him that's why those quick passes into a quick shot are extremely important when it comes to 1v1s and when it comes to 2v2 and 3v3 those quick passes into a quick shot or some of the most important fundamentals you can have because that uses your your possession and your time on the opponent's half of the field much more wisely than just banging it over and over at them right because this play for us going forward right there didn't really do anything because all we did was give them the ball pretty much much slower shot than i had expected but ended up working i'm also was trying so hard to actually speak and think about what i was trying to say that i didn't realize how slow that shot was actually going to be using too much of my brain power on speech take a time here should be fine they can panic should be pretty gold there we go all do there is pop out the wall drive for the bump on the guy that's back wall it's gonna put a lot of pressure on him to make a play he doesn't need to touch that honestly but in the moment it does look like you need to if you're if you're him from his pov so you can't blame him at all we're trying it's a good 50 good attempts you could fall 50 from dapper there we go good terms from us still had 20 boosts to work with so i thought why not let's turn again it's going to go straight down i'm going to be a shooting opportunity worst case scenario it's a 50 50 to the left or right wall and dapper's there so although it may look risky to turn for that as last back it's not as risky as it looks his boost here makes him pretty much threatless at that point as soon as the boost is taken i don't have any option going down field even now he has to get that boost though he's still empty from before i could just float on the ceiling he went for the ceiling pinch can be free for dapper watch the bump it's gonna be right side so i know it was watch right it's gonna be bad for us now i messed up a little bit but it should be fun that persay try to just block any shot on goal again make him force high and gives whoever's on back wall a free ball it's not bad to get beat to a ball like that if it gives your teammate the ball is my philosophy on that oh good doesn't matter to games pretty much over at this point as long as we kick off well unlucky the ball bounced out like that instead of going up the wall so i wanted and then i got bumped which never feel good to get scored on the ugly bumper goals but good first game let's get the next one see if we can get back to back dubs probably gonna be the same people or similar people so let's get into it let's see if we can get doesn't see i guess all right we got ourselves pure shock and storm i recognize obviously all these players shock is a pro right now current pro the other two are both oh it's very unlucky that i'm up there i would share both the high mmr players as well it's definitely be a interesting game go down to the ground here pass to the left could be a shot good team play good dunk oh wait here organ should be going but looks like he's not saga bloody use of that right stick is very important because i wouldn't have known that if i didn't try to use it play it back to the corner try to block anything middle i actually did get a really good block on that i go straight to dapper somehow kind of lucky but again you take what you can get it's a good shot close sort of unlucky as i get lucky they get lucky see you take what you can get cause kind of how rocket league is there's a lot of that stuff that happens but we end up scoring the universe knows we deserved it try to get this left side drop from dapper your control should have this on the way of it well i still pull boost as well which is best case scenario out of that one more here all right it was super lag you're not gonna lie it might still be a goal though i just read piers miss there it was super laggy though but it definitely could uh go the other way there it gets touching that ball might be a goal for them or at least a really good play moving downfield nice i tried to pinch it with him see what happens here plays out the back wall to myself go for the shot there we go we'll definitely take that we could play moving downfield we took our time on the shot we knew we had time so why not might as well take it off and dapper couldn't quite get above it but it'll be enough to get us a goal still we'll take it really good pinch from that for there all right three minutes left or goes up already playing pretty well good challenge really a challenge honestly i thought i would get it over him i got a really good first touch on the wall good piece of control as well but i panicked a little bit tiny bit wasn't really panning more so just not the touch i wanted but even then i could have just controlled it i was trying to flick it quick over him but i just died one of those octane touches it definitely do happen got back left it's got the middle up boost here ready for dapper should challenge it's gonna be over he could pass left to me i passed back right four key waiting for his double here i pre-jumped the double that was pretty dumb i mean it made dapper not be able to get back but i was kind of playing for the content i don't want to throw here though it's definitely still throwable game play down to four key oh sorry i shouldn't have went that person sorry as well because he probably thought he should have left it for me but i think i should have left it for him because i probably would be able to follow up the uh the next touch pretty easily there if i waited fake jump on the quick read make them at least rush their first touch there it's an important thing important a little minor detail that helps us a lot there them just rushing their first touch eye full boost back here not gonna be much danger if any out of this good touch good late touch helps us move downfield a little bit orca should be able to get a challenge i don't know if it's enough though over to forkey let him touch that that's fine see what comes out of this just trying to challenge you that's all you can ask for really try to wall dash back again i shouldn't have went because they ended up going but again obviously we're not calming we're not in discord or anything so it's impossible to know but it's happening a lot try to get this left side it's also really late at night i think we're all kind of not that focused lately the only time i've had time to record has been really late at night so a lot of the games have kind of felt like this blocked a lot of the angle there all you can really ask for out of first man challenge not that bad i think it's like a a bad like what's the word stigma but the right word that if you get beat as first man it's a bad thing it's not necessarily a bad thing as long as you force the ball like that wide for a teammate that's fine i i don't mind dabbing at a ball that goes wide perfectly for a teammate that's the way i see it that's why the third main position can actually be really nice to play in my opinion sometimes because your teammates will literally just give you free balls over and over again got a bump there i was about to flick the dapper on the wall good timing from them on the bump shot touch one more for them good game though outside of like the thousand double commits there were a pretty good game can you complain that's going to be off this thing i hope you enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night what are the times you guys are watching this
