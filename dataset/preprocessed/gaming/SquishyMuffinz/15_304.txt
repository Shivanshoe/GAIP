video you know what is love you guys in the last video we finished off at shape to give to yet again I know I know DejaVu I've said this before but for whenever more or less then we work two videos ago because last minute we won one last one again so this is just a never-ending cycle that we're gonna end we're gonna finally end this video I'm telling you we're gonna win two games we're gonna get up to camp two div four and it's gonna be all good vibes all around so let's get into the games let's see how they go wait why does this feel like it's gonna be a super unfair game I'm very scared the merciless tiger guy that we had in the previous video it wasn't too solid I won't lie to you so let's just hope I keep my turn nuts but I don't know maybe straight down one of my teammates should have this for free if they go no one who's ready for it though another double miss my past self left let's go dude good job weed you have to be ready for that when I like to seed this is a good tea we're fighting against we're playing with a new player though in our team ASN Rubik and you hit the shot is ready for the past you turn the middle there he gave me an option that's what I like to see you keep it up as well you see if you need more of that we can win this game I believe definitely a tough tough team here though nice Oh do it to a merciless okay okay that is what I like to see that is what I like to see you didn't really fake that guy they got it straight up with one Hey I mean we take those we will not complain about something like that for sure my bad my bad my bad I sure don't need to be there it's the left side you got the wall good try I'll back off now versus up super far away he's never gonna win that challenge in the air that is Internet I can't catch a break dude how does that go in my net there is no way in a million years this guy tried to do this but it just goes in it just goes in I'm better off not even touching the ball there and you just give us a free ball I'm so sorry I'm so sorry Keane a decent challenge but oh no way oh my god Olivia teammate Goodspeed brush it down good kill see my time is I know I have space here for the past across it wasn't quite ready but wait you almost got that insta my gosh so scary merciless justice did you miss way too much another team I'm sorry I know you should but I just don't that one game you just missing like everything is scary one oh the shot I can't I can't shoot I can't shoot go for the bump on me Oh big miss two minutes 55 seconds left this is a win we desperately need I believe we can hold on - I'm gonna go for a kill ya I'd be pretty nice so I get one to make sure to have a ball you free nice a lot of booty sweaty middle years well we're gonna get spot to deal with this letter Rolf the wall sticker time knock at dunk to oblivion again try you to river one but he played super patient got the bum police not a bad job but also not a great one because they still got the ball directly off of it played down at my teammate I wasn't the spot to follow that's fine I'm gonna get some pads here holy that was internet that shot a shot from them is a solid team or playing air-dropped my teammates recognize they should turn in okay and I see Joe not the best touch from him to be honest I thought he was gonna have a touch more forward he's hit it to the side and I got killed me it would've been really bad but I'm gonna take my time back here how does I almost go in every time it's crazy only me men Plus every 50 is going straight to the moon not gonna be in but I didn't have touch really bit miss you'd have it easier than me and obviously I don't have a shooting opportunity out of that cuz I can't shoot special one more time just to mess them up I'll go for the boost as well it's gonna be below and I bump them close and leave it there nice Udo that's fun horsemen headed to the side I'm chilling back here again I can't over address on this okay a little bit scary won't live but I think that it covered can't do a crazy man with that mister they bounce you I'm just gonna fake this and just leave what's going to go dude I hate the defensive like the defensive touches like this like what he's how I supposed to know you're gonna do that it's it's just so hard it's just so hard to know that's Mack and the guys bumping me please yes let's go meet up for it okay okay it's fine it's fine this is such a bad mistake I said a big mistake on defense like touch me like that it's so slow so lofty there's so much time to shoot off of it and I'm getting bumped at the same time other teammates not able to really help out with it either I'm glad he was there for that I'm gonna kill him this dude's oh he's out of the play for the last three seconds of the game there we go it should be game over here it's not letting them score here I refuse nice alright we got the win we did that that brings up the champ to give it three most likely we should give up off that 18 points let's see should be give up them I'd be surprised if anything yeah we got it all right champ qd3 let's get the next win get us up the champ to give four that was a massive when I was a hard-ass game to win we almost lost at the end it system just like such a small small defensive mistake whoa we say small but is massive like it was a big mistake of course but something like that we just can't have that happening yeah I mean that that one mistake can cost you a game that's been floating last game and a set of Rubik against some of the players from the last game as well I should have called kickoff that's my fault I'll stay on this it's gonna kill any chance of a play going forward if they would have my way back here flows [Music] decent play trap that pass over to him finishing shot maybe under I think mr. correct ready and one of them got killed is lost I'll go back here good try finish I'll go for this off the back you should be there for a shot good finish hold on no we got this I believe I have faith in my team I think my team's really sold this game to be honest from what I've seen and a lot of the same players are we're never again I think this team solid you go for a kill you're a pigeon plus little bit risky has lost back there thank you you miss every good I can't go for this again pass over them the finish try wanna play patient I don't lost back here I can't go for it boy yeah I was turning put a bait the meal on fake challenges I'm gonna go down to the ground I'm gonna go for the boost in just leave now hold on to that boost like I mentioned the previous videos because you want to make sure you have that boost to be able to move forward you need to look right here gonna go down he's probably the miss actually got there come on though it's just good cut another didn't have down the wall nice let's shoot I'm gonna be there first I'm gonna wait slab-sided corner put my teammate back to my teammate try gonna go back now with a goalie three minutes left pretty solid good reach my teammate when I go for this keep pressure up tell you go for a kill before I leave here I gets up the backboard again I'm gonna straight down feel free kill again I skip for another kill both teammates not quite there to follow yet but it's fun a lot of pressure going on a lot of damage is coming through Alex me wasn't ready it's like it there nice kill so many Devils coming through meant one more middle I'm not gonna go for it I'm just there to force that touch gotta go back for a second and then I could turn on this probably but the bump of these and there's no fault for a sec review probably a little more I can't believe that how this thing went up didn't have a second touch gonna make him waste his boost there you go it's all wasted and I can hit off the back empty net a lot of demos going on this game in like both sides coming a bunch of mr. bass I had to go back keeping it in nice job gonna go for the gold steal just ended up killing the only guy that could save it you left the match he just straight-up left alright that was a quick game I was a super quick game I think we play well more just cuz I was at earlier forfeit and that be the last game of the video I think we got to play one more after that but that was a nice win day if we win the next one will be we did for up still did three but I guess we're super close to before after that I'm pretty sure champ threes gotta be like 1200 mm or I'm guessing that dudes on rank but I think champ three is 1200 evermore so we'll see we'll see this into the next game that'd be the last day of the video cuz I got left early yeah let's see how it goes alright so we got the last game in the video on European servers there's a lot of names in here that we don't quite recognize from players who played before but there's one to another team the fame fixer and the paging guy that we recognize from previous games so let's see this goes to be honest I don't know what to expect I really hope my teammates are nuts but who knows where's case scenario we end up still ahead in MMR after this video anyway oh okay we're good we're here we're good again the muscle memory sometimes what this is a like a European server all right behind this dude I'll put this next let's play middle quick I got to do less of those off the quarter passes now this is not working as well as it used to this is hiring players I'm gonna fake that dude how did I just like jump off the ground like that what all right you're passing us it looks so weird oh I wish I had more like direct passes this game is helos work off the backward will work as well good try has a really big chance nice finished you know huge dude it's so satisfying when your team scores a goal with this challenge this feels good all right strike a close one on the field off the back nice challenge huge Oh close close good idea I like it a lot we did their teammates won one of them I made a bad touch I won't lie I'll try to hit that forward and went to the wall but there's two teammates back I just don't see how this is ever go but it's okay it's okay this is the classic this is literally why we've lost like all the games are you lost or just defensive mistakes I should never really be goals but it's fine it's all good you know what happens what are you gonna do everything feels so brilliant it's over that I'm just gonna go I no longer trust either of them on defense I won't lie to you I want to play as if they're not even back if it was like a fast shot coming in which again is not how you should play it to be honest you shouldn't be like that but it's just what I've what I've noticed so far to this game go to team I should have one of them should be going for this at least fake nice you minute okay it's fine gonna work hard for a goal again now good challenge will done i came to challenge as well as it she's too far away patience paid off they're off the backboard he's gonna miss for sure it's really awkward for him nicely don't you Joe all right we got it back we got a bet this is huge master or for the bump immediately after that a good job to be there for my teammates but I like to see all right now just got to play good defense can't go for any bad touches it's not gonna play for anything risky I don't wanna leave him in a similar spot that's gonna get a scored on other way that shouldn't be evil they're both kind of close to each other so it's not gonna be any anything coming out of this so we definitely take those you know we need a two goal buffer helps a lot helps a massive amount when you never know what can go into this rank to be honest with you I beat him off the wall I gotta stop saying beat him off I really do gotta stop saying that to have it nice I'm just gonna stay back here lmit me go first I'm gonna rotate all the way back so he knows it's him and then I can follow this next cut jump pretty easy obviously you can't talk to each other and so senator but there is such a thing as like car body language I guess the best way to explain is like if you see someone's car going a certain way let's write an amount of speed you know kind of what their intents gonna be the next auction that that's kind of how you learned to read the game as well like he's pretty slow he didn't try to flick this middle probably you could tell it just based off how he's going toward the ball and that's the whole idea of like car body language and in this game it's how you read the play pretty much by seeing how everyone's going toward it how their cars better make contact with the next touch stuff like that wide open baby let's go I think both of them nice little touch to the side after it get my teammate the goal nice little fake to play slow good finish hold on all right this game should be in the bag it should be we'd have to myself pretty bad yeah after that tweet to get people the key so Center it took me 30 minutes to finally get my first I can't even find the game and I ended up tweeting to get people to queue and I was finding games like instantly after that no please don't tell me ID seed game please don't tell me ID seed game don't you dare tell me I deceive you better sure like you better just warp everyone back to where they should be and we'll be fine please game did this dude just ddos my ass he was afk the whole time I can't believe my eyes you I just can't believe my eyes and I came to him back in unable to connect to the game server are you kidding me that was a free 20 points game what give me that game what do you mean what do you mean I hate I hate the servers in this game sometimes I won't lie to you guys but that's gonna be it for today's video it's gonna be it you know that should have been I should've been in Game one but it's whatever you know we'll have to win again in the next video but it's fine we're really close to champ we're really close to division for now we're pretty much division for pretty sure like we wanted to MMR away and would have got it for sure after that maybe even got up the champ three off of that another percent sure but either way guys getting closer to the big milestone of grand champ and yeah we're getting a lot of dubs back to back to back so I like to see hope you guys enjoying the series like comment subscribe to see you guys all in the next one I love y'all peace you
