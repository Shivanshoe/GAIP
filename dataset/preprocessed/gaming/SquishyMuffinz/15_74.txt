yo what's up guys for today's video i'm going to be duo queueing some threes with gimmick from v1 my ex teammate from c9 obviously the homie so it should be some good games let's get into it so you can get some dubs i think we're almost top 10 in threes i believe we'll take a look real quick we are number 20. so we're not that far off honestly we're only just as number 10 and he's what 35 points ahead of me so it's definitely doable just got to win a couple games so let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves uh duckenstein against geoid's knight and comet or commit sorry why'd i call him comet that'd be a sick name actually my boost is low here so i'll just go for a bump force that guy a little bit off the play at least like make their spacing a little bit like disjointed for a bit i think there's no there's no downside in doing that it's a good 50s get away for his next touch here close played across the gimmick side it's a good touch for him teammates should be back there good control touch to our corner let me get some pads here because i'm just getting the back boost i think i think he'd try to leave the back piece for me both that the same thing in mind might be a goal there we go thank you i was kind of just spotting the other team like where they're at in the field and i saw that there's a little bit of an opening so i can just take a quick shot not an easy shot to hit to be honest but if you can't spot the opening that's the hardest part i think not often you can get just a cross map bowl like that so you definitely have to pick your time and when you can shoot it against better players it's a good bump attempt there from gimmick oh sorry my bad i bumped him a little bit i didn't want to take it from him but i think he wanted me to just pinch it off and up a good set of 50s nice from duck i took my time a little bit on those shots like i did a really good job to read that but the way i just like floated there is the best way to take those shots i think because if they miss gonna be a goal for sure if not i mean it's gonna be hard for you to score regardless so i really think that's the best way to go about it it's okay to commit on it i think because i mean you're only committing one of you for potentially all three of them i think that's like a worthy trade you know if you're going you're forcing that pressure on them if you don't go at all they're gonna have more time they're gonna see you're not going so i think in threes it's more about just putting that pressure up i think you know good sign very very kind kind words brother wait for comments next touch he's gonna go for a bump on me play to the side i think i should single jump there instead of flipping maybe i can possibly follow it up it'd be hard to follow up regardless but definitely more of a chance too if i single jump there it's a good pass across didn't have a touch today so i'm not gonna go there's no danger again i think like like the danger assessment is like a big thing too in threes like being able to know what what can actually potentially lead to a goal against you it's a really valuable skill as well you might should go hopefully right side better play it off the back wall for gimmick but that was a good stay from geoids there the positioning is really good [Music] played off the gimmick side nice 50. i'm not going to go for this yet because he's on the back wall someone's on the back wall they'll always beat you if you're off the ground it's like a pretty good thing to learn there like even there i should know what probably but i'm kind of just banking on the bounce being um like awkward for him which is possible like it's possible that they'll miss off of the bounce being just a little bit awkward it's only a while ago sometimes for those nothing for a duck then i have like two touches here probably and gimmicks and go first so i'll just be behind him there were two of them almost over all three is really good to control that all the way out like that a good touch there that's control from gimmick really good job you gotta buy two people and completely switch where the ball is at it's really valuable try to pass it mid nice good take again i knew like any kind of touch middle there is going gonna create so much time so it's a good thing to like just pay attention to where the opponents are at at all times uh unfortunate do i touch one more i ended up missing all good can't actually score this i can maybe dunk him let's force him to the corner again it's gonna be good for my teammate most of the time didn't end up too bad for us we still we still have the ball anyway one more touch here i try to play it around them that's tough the angle i was coming from i should have this let me take my time probably gonna get touching this i think it's always the good reason to take your time if you can't really get the best first touch on it i had to pass off to gimmick a little bit too slow right idea though oh my i didn't even see him there like tunnel missions on the ball there let's watch the last midpass here we both we both had the own gold block all right good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs should be a good one see how it goes all right for the last thing we got ourselves fry on our team against banger jerry jerry and wonder mike or maybe invite one to mike actually maybe for another video nice that's the opening we found there clear time back wall a little wave dash to catch it good touch around the other guy and then one final touch to get it past the third man it's all played good way to start off the game one of mike's very good with the solo plays you guys know already played them in a lot of videos got to watch out for anything he's doing in the air it's always going to be threatening can we challenge yet just gotta wait for whatever this is good block funk mid try to block them it's fine if i can get this boost it's not a big big deal honestly but it got past me nice play from gimmick there if i get bumped he's gonna follow it but still works out he's gonna stay nice dunk really good challenges for my team that's the patience there like i shot it like actually flipped into it it might have been too hard to save to be honest i'm kind of just banking on him not to have the perfect shot cause even if the highest rank guys people make a lot of mistakes people are still not gonna be anywhere near perfect sorry even at that very highest rank you can make him doing that a lot trying to leave it for each other so write intention in mind for sure we're trying we're trying to leave each other in the best spot to go for the ball or but we're both ending up just leaving the ball completely one more touch from fry here would be big close gonna have a hit here let him touch that i can't actually beat him he can't land in and gets that in time a solo play it's a good 50 as well a lot of good challenges coming out of our tv ah that's a good follow-up challenge like really really good follow-up challenge because i have to dodge that bump it's gonna take an extra second for me to get off the ground then that guy knows that it's a really good job for him to be there can actually challenge that yet it's fun trying to stay behind i'm here in support most time if you're like right behind someone like that when they're challenging you're gonna have a really good follow-up challenge on it so it's a good spot to be a lot of the time i'd say there's some occasions where you don't want to be just behind someone for sure most time it works out quite well can't follow that up one of mike's up anyway it's good about i should actually be going for a little bit more bumps the way they're playing right now on defense they're like leaving way too much of a gap between challenges so i think there's a lot of time to get bumped here but i'm not really going for them as much as i should be if i play this down the middle he makes you still win that ball those passes are so strong even if they're not ready for it they'll still have a chance to get there to get a bump on them there one touch to fry to try i'll go all the way back here we don't have a third man yet really so try to fill that role for a second but my team's still addressing it's a good demo regardless of if you got the ball pass against a really good demo makes it hard for them to do anything now there's no fall off right ah very good stop from wonder would have probably been a goal that's probably gonna go anyway all good wait for fries touch he's gonna play it around to me let him hit that doesn't matter he has no boost so there's really no threat here that's i almost gotta go to just that and we end up getting a go out of that so there you go it's a good example of me like kind of evaluating the threat in the situation what can he do he's gonna have to rush this ball he has no boost his touch here is gonna be panicked gonna be some sort of like force touch mix all he can do if i don't actually give him the free challenge right he's trying to hope that i challenge him there that's what he wants so not challenging is not giving him what he wants and he has to eventually give our team the ball we're gonna go out of it so yeah hope you guys enjoyed it have your sub wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe i see us all in the next one i love y'all peace you
