closer and closer to grand champ we're so damn close maybe we need two wins today but I'll probably get us up to Division three Division four ish and then maybe the next video if we're in both my DoDEA's grand champ so hopefully we keep up our or streak with these wins let's get into the game for today let's get some dubs hopefully alright so I think we've got some good players on the team here I do recognize some of the guys another team and they're solid as well so kind of worried but also confident in a way about this match Vindico though was a guy we had previously and he was super solid but I remember but we could do this I believe it's up good block he's gonna be there can't quite do anything so let's go for demo it's fine I'll have any boost easy right now just good show back for a sec I'll fall down here to play pretty aggro so far which is which is a good thing because we do need them to score but they're leaving a lot of like gaps open on defense it seems like so we got to be careful about that stuff - oh that's good you're trying that good bum keep me in here you're on that guy's a lot really needs to be there I'll go back now trying to be a good third man here I try to push off the wall if I can follow it up king quiet I believe my teammate scary spot to be able to believe how do you get for this gonna pop it up like I didn't actually challenge it's kind of good for us but anyway I didn't need to rush that I wouldn't there's one goal here dude I believe he was chasing really hard that one deed world's worst flirt yeah together just following too close for the bolt is you want to try to if you find yourself doing that try to position yourself further away like I am right here I'm going where the ball will be rather than where it is currently it's your best bet spots like that should I grab dive abuse I missed just a mechanical mistake missing that I just didn't turn properly got a corner though good follow he's being super Eriko and it's probably that it's really good close tap it right there I put out the back he tried not a terrible try I can change that though just keep pressure up really I smile like that it's good a turn double shower cover close two goals here come closer I believe keep with the pressure here's behind me so I'm about to make it touch you let her go off backward if anything it's funny take your boost oh let's go did we take those we take those every run with them we do we definitely do I just take their booster I was gonna go back to my teammate regardless that such and that guy staring for some reason own world so I mean I'll take you yeah I'm gonna say defending say nice to go nice to go how about Timmy I didn't think he'd be back for yet you go for that that's fine I'll go back now I was just there to the least made up to touch anything cute crazy good touch my teammate take over this guy as well there we go I just block them perfect drop my see now go back all the way go the way for touchy I believe my team you an unwilling to be honest but you got out alive there 30 beats back I mean a wall to this leave everything we can get you we need it we get one more that's perfect I'd be the ideal setup just one more time at least around that guy got a kill nicely done your job a shot to finish that well then well done let me go for Busan leave here gonna be first nice to draw Francie right I didn't think give you back for a second which is kind of scary but I should have believed I'm gonna go back and go yeah it's probably better just wait for shot sugar yeah and a panic on that and go for a rush challenge if they're gonna get spilt up middle anyway way back here wait for a flick challenge immediately after the flick I know my team is gonna bake that out at least go for challenge you think it's flick that's fine doesn't really matter too much he's gonna get back to her team regardless she's gotta be ready to follow that up same kind of situation they accept a challenge too late this could be bad I'm gonna wait for shot trying the shot try again you know no need to panic their shots have to be really perfect day for those to go in put that back into my teammate couldn't quite get it off wall shot to finish it Oh to try to read it you try it's gonna be their first yeah at the wall I didn't want to score brush on the past was like an awkward in-between all right gggg we needed that that's big and stick every single of these wins is huge 14 more points for that probably the other division up I think I hope yeah a division up to champ three deep three let's go one more win this video get us probably up to do for most likely and then the next sort of might be able to snag that big old juicy grand champ so let's get into next game so you can keep it up like the old ago that's what I like to see all right full asking the video we got the exact same team as last time they're playing against one of the players from last game as well and he was solid so we'll see not sure what to expect but I have faith we've won with this team before we could win again so I know both about termites are in front of me here they're still in front of me so I just got a kill time one of them finally rotated back should be able to get this I don't feel confident I'm first to that ball so I just played a little more for more patient that I probably should have should've just went I assumed that my teammate would be behind me regardless of what happened but the 50 went straight middle isn't everything to be fair but definitely could have been saved my students a better position can't always do everything perfectly in terms of defense you always got to be ready to you know backup your teammates next touch being support whenever you can of course I believe that only one go hit off the wall all that really can be done with that that's fine see you guys here this behind me so I'll try plays off corner actually best for him good patience like to see off back nice good job he's ready for it well done well done good bump and got the guy behind this ready for the lead off the backboard it's hard not to keep that it was really hard not to shoot that but before does he get shot with them to be there we brought it back just like that it's a huge one to get for us you can get it we go down here it's fine too much should have this I trust them oh I'm sorry but my team it they're obviously that's not just went down there is pretty awkward whole situation there if she got a touch on that you did it forward I try to play this off the back again little getting a little too agro there my TMS is just balled up and get support on I don't want to leave my team in spots like that where it's easy to easily get counted over one round to pretty much around three my bump the other as well slowly moving down the field my team is rotating all the way back those would be my ball to go for most likely come for the demo that's fine so force the ball out play downfield to the side where no one could really fill it up and then off the wall quick go back not quick nice for my team II gotta have some form of trusted him and I situation it is definitely an awkward ball from the deal with play done with that well close really good pass back and it's so close and I've been huge fire up for thus not give a lot of pressure you know so I can back off it's fine to me should go next good job Express release you should be there go do a challenge finish it out good bang so I like to see off the back I'll try to kill one on they play the patient they played a wall my teammate did good to keep fresh a/c done job pressure again nice a lot of good follow-up it's coming from a team there I have a lot of good challenges coming in and midfield will just keep it really a pressure for us or visit positioning really well for the next touch which is what's allowing all this team it's a repositioning wall just get so I like to see I would love to get that over that guy that's all good I trusted my team's on the backboard it's pretty easy to deal with in that spot awesome after me that they did around that guy killed which is good it's fine let's pull me back a boost this is bad exile getting bumped up get up the wall against and kill a little bit more time let's get for us at all nice job 21 seconds eat let's go let's go let's get this dog we're gonna soak up the GC van we need this would we need it good job to be there there's I like to seamen oh no getting all upset it's fine we gotta play good defense here your defense is the name of the game to win this 21 seconds nice kick off well done come on guys I believe you can get our Tommy go tell me your first nice I don't like to use that quick chat too often but I just really like that I was trying to be more safe should've hit forward yeah I'm gonna sleep back let him go first again it's fine I can get a kill here probably banging downfield there we go that's the game well done well done got two wins again got another 13 points from that that might be Division four secured as well I'm not sure if not now it's not the vision for secure but it's fine cuz next video if we do get two wins that should be grand champ might play two or three games if we get two wins the next video and we're not Grand Champion put one more and hopefully they'll be the green chain video if you lose one then I'll extend it into another episode but hopefully we can get our wins next video and finally reset grandshaykh milestone but yeah super solid set again for today guys
