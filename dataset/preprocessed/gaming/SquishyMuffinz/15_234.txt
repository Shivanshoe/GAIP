yo what's up guys going to be playing some more games today with torment should be some good ones let's get straight into it let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing against hiroko and don so we played taroko in the last video with tor and playing him again with a new player who's also very high mmr instead of i think it was rodoko who was a rlrs level player last time gotta wait for the the dribble here eyeshadows baited out for tour which would be annoying you don't really do anything too crazy in situations like that just try to stop their play from moving forward but at the same time helping your teammate out so they can come in pretty freely and make a play like torment just did right there that was huge if you want to stop those awkward dribbles that are coming in that is going as many times as possible i'm gonna pop that up because it is awkward but i should kill time for tour to be able to get back might be fast enough there we go the double jump on that dribble just scented as fast as it needed to be to be ahead of him really good start there try to go back here nice oh i couldn't get the kill on him there we go good job to turn that middle there i was trying to kill that guy if i was able to kill him would have been a lot easier would have been able to get that past middle to torment he was just waiting for me there it's okay should i go for this to help him should be good for himself gonna hit the ceiling it's gonna be really awkward if i can kill one be good got that boost i'll go for a demo here too i should have waited probably but that's fine let him hit that there we go it's an absolute banger holy wait for torment trying to block them here that's pretty big to go for honestly as long as the next challenge is one which it was that's pretty big if you get one out of the plate plus you waste all their boost and they have to fall down like pretty far out of the play it's a huge challenge to win be a good first game and i could see us running into toronto again because he's super high mmr and uh he's one of the closest mr players on right now so let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up they go they go all right running into leaks and don't here i'm actually not sure how good leaks is but we found this game instantly and me and torment are both like 20 200 2300 mmr so you know it's got to be a a good player if you found the game that quick normally how the mmr works you find the game instantly if the person is near you your skill rating i'm gonna go for that quiet because he's really close to that try to block them should be good for tour good control i like that really good idea nice got one other play just by waiting all we did was just wait pretty big got his boost he's gonna be the low here trying to plays it out smart we're gonna have free possession actually no one for that which is fine tour landed in a good spot i thought maybe i can get a beat on that guy you gotta try to be proactive in situations like that to get goals i thought maybe i can beat that guy back there and it would have been good for us but it's all right i trust tore on this reed an awkward situation but god of it temporarily huge 50. i'm going to wait on right side you're totally going to go back and get boost so don't go to challenges too aggressively that's two challenges that we won tour with another challenge one and i can come in late just pop that see what he does try to get a shot of that i'll go for the corner boost here you have to hit off the wall anyway not bad at all for us we'll take that oh that bumper against us is pretty unlucky he bumped us up into the ball gonna take all our boosts here tour wins this challenge is pretty big it's like i stayed a little bit too long for our boost all right roll this up the wall hopefully actually it's good for tour he's gonna beat me try to just go for the mid boost here should be fun nice it's one of those sweaty games already you could tell it's gonna be one of those one goal games there we go it's really awkward a situation i did not expect the bounce to go there but we'll take it took our time got the dribble i like to stay on those because that guy's got to waste his boost now headed over to tour that's normally a good thing play it forward toy's gonna have a pretty good chance here beat one top pretend i have no more boost and use more they're all just spamming i don't know if they spend me each other or us i can't tell so we have full boost back which is huge here i missed tour should have this nice it looks a little bit awkward i wasn't fully sure i'm unlucky nice uh i was trying to kill him it's okay though i'll stay backward if this gets over him should be okay there we go pretty big beat good beat from him though i might be a goal that's unlucky they bounced really well for them that could have easily hit the the downward bounce it'd be unscorable but we should have we should definitely challenge better that spot good challenge from him nice we still got it read me like a book i knew he'd end up there when i saw him on the wall i knew that's about where his timing would have been if i banged it and he trusted me to get the pass that's what we like to see okay turn on now they're being super aggressive on balls that aren't really gonna do a whole lot to be aggressive on should be fine here actually really good for us just launch a shot take the boost here towards another shot here good try that's fine baited out the ball it was really awkward so we'll take that whatever that was go for the boost couldn't quite get we got the ball next best thing actually the first best thing but to get both is always the goal all right i'm a little late i don't think i can help him should be okay challenge was good from tor there killed a lot of time because he fitted it toward the wall he didn't fit the middle it's gonna be dead there we go the first game was a really quick forfeit so i'll play one more for this video that was intense though for sure i could have played better throughout that but it's okay let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up let's see how it goes all right we got toroku and daunt again all right they're going to play better this time for sure taroko is always a threat in twos i always got to watch out for his dribbles very uh intelligent player for sure the way he likes to navigate his twos it's a good challenge though try to kill me it's pretty good to get in the way again i'm just trying to stop them any way i can let them hit that that's actually good this toy's gonna have a free ball nice touch to control it should be okay nice don't need to panic or anything there because i'm often not your teammates can be back to help you as long as you you did a good job to stall that's good actually pretty good from us because again we give that the tour for free and that's our whole our whole mission there let's try to get that at the tournament huge kill close good try on the 50. not a bad idea i couldn't get a banger so i decided go for the control play here do that for tour grab this other boost the challenge is super quick on everything now trying to give us any time tours dribbling really well there trying to make it hard for them to to play this super quick challenge game it's gonna be there for that the control there we go following up on each other just plays pretty well in these awkward spots you gotta be aggressive in those situations like you gotta have some sort of initiative to force a goal you can't be too scared in those spots and wait i also never actually get a goal out of those situations every goal comes from somewhat forcing an issue that could you know could in theory get you scored on as well if you mess it up you got to be willing to take those risks try to get around this on the wall that's actually really good for us baited one all the way in he wasted all his boost as well now he has to rotate out and torment getting plays down the field which is really good it's over two i'll leave now i have a good rotation going right now good dunk for us to kill some time for me though not back for a little bit really good speed from him actually huge speed nice kill should i wait behind tory on the wall i can't actually reach that i've thrown one for the bum it's gonna delay him or at least make him get a bad hit it's fine actually pretty good for us for the shot gotta turn it again and keep pressure torque and try to go for this couldn't shoot i was in such a weird spot it was actually really good play from tour you got a middle somehow i don't even know how he fit through that middle but it was beautiful it was actually perfect i thought i'd go for the demo because then that would have actually been open for us if i did joker's just trying to stay grounded it's smart it's a good play all you do is drive into him though to mess him up should be fun chances of me getting the angle like super low most of the time so you can't be too worried about that that's fine really a challenge from stroker it's actually really good to go off the ceiling in those situations just because you can cover so many more angles off the ceiling in comparison to just jumping for the ball should be okay for us nice and tour i'm just gonna wait here it's fine they have to do a lot of work to keep this up i don't think it's gonna happen tor should have a free hit downward it's gonna be the game though nothing you can do about that there we go all right ggs guys i hope you enjoyed a
