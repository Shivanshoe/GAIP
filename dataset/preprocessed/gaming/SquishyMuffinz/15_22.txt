yo what's up guys for the last video we ended up queueing all three game modes threes twos and ones it was actually quite fun so i'm gonna play all three games again whatever we get we'll end up playing and yeah hopefully we get some good games we'll see how it goes i don't know it's because i'm the lowest rank out of the three in threes but i keep instantly queuing threes when i do this i would assume that 1v1 would be easiest to find there's only one person but it's not there's probably way less people in high rank 1v1 than like somewhat low rank 3v3 i'm in like grand champ 3 3v3 right now i think oh good not the best start low meet 16 boring on us all good i'm gonna focus up i was trying to figure out in my head how we always find these threes games when we do this try to follow this again past middle that's a good backbone touch a try no wait safe here i'm taking a third man for a second here so i should just wait it's like again you can't jump anymore so that's my green light the challenge as soon as he doesn't have that flip left anymore huge beat you let him touch this i played around one more humans can't instago for that but i can get a demo which is huge teammates should go now if i could follow some myself would be good oh no one actually went on their team which kind of picked me out a lot harder than if they did go tried to bump him again good try try to stop him from getting in the way of that hoping my teammate could finish it off but couldn't quite reach it try to block it maybe or something high at least imagine that's the real jack black there's a chance maybe he likes rocket league that'd be kind of crazy but on that one try to see if i can get over one but he's gonna be closer to it than me close good pressure here though jack black should have this maybe nope you're not going to guess i'll guess i should follow really we're getting more pressure than they are here for sure but it's definitely possible to like get a quick counter here turn it around with my teammates to go the left side maybe get a bump i don't think he'll expect me to go for a bumpy at least force him to jump early makes the air drop will not be as good as he wanted it to be i almost saved it let's get a try good attempt when you come back here lots of time two and a half minutes in this game is in a absolute eternity let's do a challenge let zebra touch this off the back wall should be free shot it's a good attempt not so good attempt but maybe it'll be okay nice oh it's actually so close they bring a bit of control there it's actually really good really hard to get that touch like that very controlled play forward one to me one more touch forward maybe nice all right we got time it's doable minute 40. good piece of control there it won't be one for a while so he's gotta get a good flick okay so definitely possible to come back from now we've given ourselves a lot of breathing room two goals once it reaches like sub one minute it becomes pretty difficult but at this point it's very doable this might be bad now jack black should just go yeah if he doesn't go earlier like as soon as he realizes someone's gonna be behind him he's got instagram if he does that then i can actually get to save if not it becomes too close to the net and it's impossible for me to react to whether the 50 is coming through or not pass across here nice doable i saw the challenge thing in threes is so important and it's a lot of trusting your team to be there for you and that's why lower ranks can be really hectic because there is no trust and this i would consider is a lower rank and it's like one definitely one of the higher out of the lower ranks but it's one of the lower ranks for sure um and the trust already is lacking compared to the higher rec stuff in ssl so on nice that was a really good delay there to get it around them that's a good read on the miss touch i figured it would be awkward for him and the the last guy back however is trying to read whatever's going to happen next is going to be in a weird spot no matter what it's well done 55 seconds left i'm going to tying it back up i don't know how to be honest but this is winnable now forward one big hit oh so close nice good job i ran out of boost that's how i had it but really good pass from rhombus good job to look for me there a lot of people don't even bother looking for the player up field it's really good you can create a really threatening opportunity out of that every time 30 seconds now it's about not giving up a big mistake here could have this huge 50s really good job get some pads here i'm not going gonna over commit for the mid boost i know he's gonna be there first for that now my teammate goes it's it's a good try i'm just gonna wait my ass should actually be jack black playing with a friend or something because he doesn't look very crazy for this rank i find that so funny it's a big win no boost here you could fake the next touch teammates aren't going it actually could be a goal which would be tragic all right we're good all righty good first game with jack fly well well done we actually got a dub there i'm not sure how huge come back like i said two minutes a lot of time so much happened in that remaining two minutes and uh we're able to come back there so let's get to the next one let's even keep it up see how it goes all right another 3v3 game paginator iconic themes ducky and easy kj was from he was four from way back i remember when i first got the game i played kitchenaider back then back when i first met justin like all the way in 2015. i didn't know you're still playing it's crazy the og's he's still decent too it's up there in rank another way for him to go and then just play it over him now he's a 1v1 good try he didn't have another flip here and then just stay on it it's a really good 50 and i thought some boost follow this up plate middle that was very risky my third to go but good idea all right that was a really good shot very good placement that's unfortunate i got bumps by him but not really anything we could do about that just where he landed on the wall a little backflip i could just wait on the left here wait for my teammates to bait it that's not what i expected i'll just leave if it's ever awkward just try to back off get into a more favorable position it's a good attempt good keeping this gonna go all the way back and just chill here it's fine forcing the plate to the corner dodge the bump as well teammates can just fade it out middle it's not going to be here in time you gotta get shot at least nice try to put this down for my teammate try really good try we're getting a lot of like good opportunities in ass wise all right we have time we should kill time for our team here oh that's really bad that's situation okay so what i did was find my opinion completely fine i've got a lot of time for them to get behind me and get boost right but you don't want both teammates waiting in the same spot for the outcome of the air dribble air dribble is perfectly good there it's very very good to do that because it kills a lot of time and it honestly leaves the opponent just like having to play off of you and they can't move until you're done your dribble essentially so if your teammates are positioned properly and your second man's like under you and your third man's deep there's nothing that can get wrong there only they can go wrong is if what happened happened where both of them were right under the ball essentially having no third man there but it became risky not that much you can do there though if you're the air dribbler very good to do that just to kill time if you notice you last for a while kill time like that for them to get boosts very useful play around all of them try to go for a bump again just stalling here just my i roll in a situation get behind the ball stay in front of it kill time my team wants to take it after that they can it's just more about trying to get into a position where it's much less risk than there was on the wall nice my first touch here gonna have one more how to play it around it was a good try they could definitely still come back same thing i was talking about last game in threes anything is uh anything's possible especially with over a minute left the huge boost deal at least gonna close play down a little bit pick up the wall i don't think i can actually score this i can fake though it's a good block at least like stops his uh his line on the ball from going perfectly to his teammate which i think is good there i think it's worth it we go for a block that does that bump them as well should be free shot almost bumped the other guy trying to try to block the angle again for some wide it's like more than good enough 30 seconds left we can still lose this but i'm confident in our our defensive capabilities here oh my gosh i think that was actually going in but it's got a good block on it gotta get a crazy skimmer angle there trying to beat him to the wall maybe one more forward all right gg ggs actually like i've really been enjoying threes lately three's ranked more than anything else i'll probably try to play my threes for you guys but hope you enjoyed having yourself wonderful day or night whatever time is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and
