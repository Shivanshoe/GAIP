yo what's up guys so i get this question all the time my stream is how do i improve quick i'm at this rank how do i get to this rank and this is what i always tell people is watch your replays back try to find your bad habits write them down and try to focus on your bad habits one by one starting with the one that you see that you make the most the biggest mistake that you make the most the biggest bad habit that you have start on that and work down your list and eventually if you work down that list and you actually focus on those things individually and not crowd your mind with too many things at once you'll be able to move forward and become a better player than you currently are so i'll try to show you guys what i do personally and what i did when i was coming up and what i even do now to try to point out my bad habits and try to improve on those things so let's go into replay that we lost i'm gonna pick a random one three to five let's see it's probably a protein probably a pro scrim finding it's envy here so let's uh start off here let's go my pov and try to point out the things that i'm doing wrong that i can point out off the bat and i'll try to just go over one replay and just try to show you guys as many things as possible and ideas that i'm talking about when i tell you about bad habits that's fine baiting the ball for my team so don't be too critical of yourself as well i don't want to pause too much during this even though i know i will end up pausing a lot but don't be too critical of yourself over the little things if you should have missed a ball you shouldn't write down miss less because that's obvious i'm talking about the things that aren't as obvious and things you won't notice unless you watch yourself back this is fine here all right it's fine nothing noticeably bad so far only thing i could say that would be better is as soon as i know i'm not necessarily on back wall which is at this point is make sure i'm grabbing better lines of pads here so there's this chunk of field back here hold on my thing is glitched out why is my thing glitch okay there's a chunk of field back here um where there's no pads and you see i'm actually hovering in the one chunk of field that has nothing where i could be coming out this way or i could be coming straight down the middle here or i could be coming around this way i know justin's right here so it makes it awkward um but either way we know this is a very sort of opportunity though garrett's probably going to get to school so that's why just moving up so aggressively he has the close touch i'll have the far touch um but that's the only thing i could say there is try to position myself in a better path on the way to the ball so i'm getting more pads and i'm more useful by the time i get to the ball that way i wouldn't only have 20 boosts it's a 50. in my opinion though again if i'm being nitpicky something like this on a cheat i always tell myself it's not even turbo probably shouldn't be going for this ball um neither should i really because if i don't go for this ball at the very most turbo just hits this forward and justin has a free clear back hole and i'll be on the ground right around here so i'll be behind justin by the time he hits us out and there'll be no danger at all me falling for this after using all my boosts off the cheat which is like 40 or 50 boost it's 50 boost after using all that boost i'm falling for a while justin's last back for a while it kind of puts a lot of pressure on him or they could have just waited because it wasn't too necessary to go for back right boost it's good saving my boost which is good here it's fine good read good job to save my boost here take my time come out with garrett but that's okay try to back off at the end there just landed on it unfortunate and i have no boost and it's pretty much shocked at that point so yeah situation just led down to a little bit of unfortunateness he landed on the ball obviously wasn't trying to land on a ball but then on my dribble and it made it a little bit awkward kickoff goal one thing that i noticed is i'm flipping around too a little bit too often so i know again this is fine but like  off the bat i don't need to flip as much as i am like right there if that wasn't a goal i guess i knew it was a goal but in general that's being nitpicky as well but you have to be able to it's hard once you're okay once you're at pro level there's obviously going to be less bad habits than when you're a low level player but there will still be bad habits and the big things for me that i notice is like that's a really good fake it's a good pass as well i kind of got timing here to be honest like it looked like garrett was moving up middle i didn't see him turning away here so right here i focus on the guy that is faking last thing i saw garrett was around middle right so if i pass that there he would be able to be there but he's too far back now would have been a goal if he was there would have been way too hard for tommy to stop that's a good play in general though and good job to save my boost here but i was gonna say like bad habits are a lot harder to find once you become a pro player obviously let's see the play good try it's actually really good to just slow down the area here go quick get a nice soft touch to myself level out almost get the goal as well take my time here i don't really like turning like this though this is something i do okay this is fine because in my head i'm trying to put pressure to make him jump early so thomas is going to see me here on his screen and he's going to want to beat me to this ball he's going to think i'm going for it so i turn away i'm not going to waste my my position to challenge this so i make them throw it away but it leads to actually really good opportunity from them that's unfortunate so this is pretty much just me fully trusting in garrett to get the touch and once he backflips it's already too far behind me to do anything the bad habit that you can pick apart here obviously like garrett misses this ball one ever one every 1000 times one out of every a thousand times probably that the situation happens he probably misses one time and it was this time because he backflip which is unfortunate and i'm not gonna be ready for that obviously because it just doesn't happen but if i plant myself right here literally just sit here stop driving forward problem is i keep driving forward which is not bad this is honestly not bad because think about it if garrett does make contact on the ball right here it's gonna plop mid or it's gonna plop left and either way i'm gonna be close enough to beat any envy player to follow us so it's not a bad idea but in all fairness if i don't know the outcome which i don't know the outcome at this point it could be over guaranteed turbo could somehow pull something out of nowhere pop it over his head back wall whatever it's going to be awkward for me if i'm placed a little bit further back like right around here i literally just go afk i literally just sit there i could probably react to anything that happens i could just drive forward easily hit this ball out to justin who would turn on that wall bang counter attack you have missed out of position tommy got a position so it would have been a very different situation obviously but you know again this is something that hard to expect you know someone who never makes a mistake like that to have an unlucky mistake like backflip is very unlucky it could even be a controller that you know it could even be the controller being like worn out that that happens because of that so i wouldn't put too much into this but the one thing that i would say is driving forward too early is definitely a bad habit that's something that i'd write down try to plant myself before i know the outcome of a situation try to make sure i'm in a position to react to whatever may happen not what i think is gonna happen not move up and preemptively think what's gonna happen will happen because that's not always the case i like that i don't go for the back boost here playing for the the ball straight away this is bad this is something that i think i thought miss was gonna turn straight away off that boost grab and go for the the touch he just went all the way back so it made me force the ball away best case scenario here best thing to do i think would be just keep driving keep my full boost just let you keep driving put pressure miss would have to turn then and instead they don't they don't get the ball for free in that scenario in the scenario they get the ball kind of for free they're able to make a play going downfield go for bump on turbo not a bad idea good having to get the pads there i get killed though something to dodge demos that i don't think i do enough i don't think anyone really does enough is if you just sit right here you can't possibly have enough speed to be on this side and turn like this and have full speed there's no way and if they do they're full committing to this bump it's gonna take them a lot longer to rotate out so if i do that in this situation i think the pressure they have is a lot less to be honest and you could say pretty much anything from that position now i spawn into an awkward spot and i'm in an awkward spot for the next little passage of play here ah that's awkward as well that's what i mean it's like all that stems from the idea that if i had just hidden that in a better spot where i'm not demo-able it's a bad habit making myself too exposed on the goal line too obvious to demo too static i guess is the word where i'm just obvious where i am this touchdown missed and then he backed off fake the second touch i'm going for the block on the second touch here like to block the net i have the whole net blocked at this point he plays it wide though misses misses the double affects both of us and he gets a goal but justin's also relying on me to read this touch there but i get fake so that was well played for him but also stems back the 10 seconds before that when i got demoed and i was spawned into the worst position if i was spawned the other side would have been a lot better for the rotation to be honest see what happens here it's a mistouch from justin [Music] so i'm rotating behind here this is fine it's actually good i'm full boost there's really no way this should end up being a goal i feel like yeah so again most of the time okay justin's banging this most of the time again this is like a very that's what i mean but this is a very one-off game very one-off game so you don't want to nitpick too hard justin normally bangs this all the way to the side so there's really no threat in that garrett is already probably moving forward for that like you can see how fast garrett's going he doesn't go this fast on defense unless he's trying to follow up a touch which i think he was trying to follow up justin and at this point he has no choice because he's already committed to justin's touch that would have happened so he just jumps for the block and gets around them and it's a goal it's not a crazy goal it's nothing special but there's not much we could have really done all that different rotated behind like we should have it's just two unfortunate uh things that just don't normally happen and they're all stemming from each other really i wasn't in a terrible spot there though i think my paddling was was pretty good back to that and i had full boost in what would have been a good position it's a good bump when someone's taking control of the ball like this either get a piece of them get a piece of the ball or just drive up make them do something and back off this either is fine gets them completely off the ball the recovery time is going to be pretty bad they take a lot of land but they end up getting a goal out of that so let's see what happens here what i could do better here if i'm being critical of myself as first man first man is the the position where you take the most risks i'd like to say um so in a spot like this jumping for this is completely fine this isn't even bad because it gets him dispossessed he's using all his boosts he's falling for a long time in my opinion but if i want to play this better slow down on the wall a bit here literally make him jump and back off i'd be able to go back as soon as he jumps here like this i just go down to the ground this air dribble's never gonna go internet it's never gonna be anything bad never gonna be anything even slightly dangerous no way he has to go the whole field and he probably you might even have full boost does he he's 77 he's still not going the whole field with that he's not going to get close to the net so if i just back off make him jump back off probably a better situation because justin the second man here he goes he gets beat which is just unfortunate i think garrett expected him to win that so this situation oh gear is actually afk something happened he's heated or something i don't know what happened i don't really remember to be honest but that's unfortunate so the goals again you can't take too much out of this game i guess but what i'm trying to show you guys is there are little things that you can look at that are habits that you should cut out of your game the way you waste your boost the way you're pathing around the field this is a good fake that's close i i would have liked to have this is really smart fake not to flick that right away makes a panic he blocks the high i know one's gonna be blocking low so i try to immediately land and pop it over him which is gonna be very hard with the amount of boost i have so maybe just go for a 50 instead of going for a shot after that would have been better not food boost and i'm saving it back which is smart my first touch here that's fine but could have challenges better or not win at all atomic's really good at those touches though this is a very very specific situation because i can't tell if miss is going to land and try to flip this middle to atomic which is what i thought in my head um that's what i'm blocking that's what i'm getting ready to block but then atomic goes himself and like let's go say double commit so it's kind of hard for me to read this which is fine because it goes to gary here get the 50. it wasn't an awful situation you can't be again too over um analytical about those try nice challenges good single jump challenge i like those so you get a recovery quicker looking for bumps the guys are sitting back it's smart okay the only thing i don't like is i'm going all in here for this mid boost if this is here this is actually really really good for me but since it's not i have to take this path middle again where i don't get any pads for being in this little section this is the worst section that you can rotate back in because you just don't get anything for it and again if i come back a little bit wider like if i come back a little bit wider using these pads right here i'm on 50 or 60 boost i look how easy to say this to make for me but instead i have to rush to turn around and make a really tough save here there we go it's a good save though that's close from justin you almost get the the counter misses the read the game is pretty much over at this point i think we know that but definitely winnable to an extent we got one quick save my boost which is good this is good okay this is what i was talking about so i was already making a little adjustments i guess then myself during the game i don't know where this 50 is going i don't know the outcome yet so i just stop and i look how much time it gives me and i can create a play try to pass over to justin he asked for the pass backfall but this is really good this is something that i have to do more and it's something that i'd write down if i was making that list as a habit if you don't know the outcome of a 50 you don't know the outcome of a play just say stay where you are save your boost don't waste your position don't move too far forward because that means that the ball flies over your head unexpectedly you have to go all the way back there's no way this ball can go further than above me in this situation so it's smart to stay here had i been pushed up right here i i cannot get this ball i have to back off at the half lift go back i have to just back up try to get some awkward touch but now i'm behind the ball i can make it play forward pass to justin if he was able to make something out of that would have been a really good play that's a good example of the habit that i was talking about before i got escorted earlier my back wall here looking for bumps it's a good save that's fine we're all in here so i'm just going to keep turning and turning and turning this good play there i like this aggression if again this is a big like i'm first man there's no real risk in me going for a shot here this could be a goal this is worth going for the goal this is a goal every time if turbo doesn't make contact so that's worth it i stole my boost i can turn get another shot on goal that's worth it that's all fine it's well played played off the back wall i got bump a little bit unfortunate how to not get bumped i would be able to score probably but it'd be terrible to that ball yeah one of the goals of this game was gear being aka another one was that one um like backflip that just doesn't happen so the goals were we're not normal they weren't the greatest but um you could still learn from it you can still take from any kind of game and look at yourself don't look at the little things like that look at yourself look at where you could have done things better because no matter if your teammate makes a mistake or not there's definitely something you could have done better every single time every single time it doesn't matter the situation every goal you look back on is something you could have done better but yeah that's pretty much the idea that i wanted to give you guys is watch back your replays find your habits for me what i noticed out of just this game alone my pathing on the way back could have been better my moving forward before i know the outcome of a situation could have been better um some challenges i would jump to early when i should have been more patient stayed on the floor something like that so those would be the biggest habits for me that i should focus on i think the biggest one should should up be my um having mixed with i think i think they go together my pathing and um my uh again not reacting to a situation before it happens so you gotta wait for that that action to happen before there's a reaction i think i'm trying to react before the action happens sometimes and try to preemptively be in position which can get you scored on but that's a good thing to have for offense which will put you in good positions to score at the same time you don't want to overdo that and be out of position because sometimes if you over position for example in their box right around here for something that happened and it doesn't happen you are now committed with your teammate and one guy's back for a very long time so you want to be very smart about how you handle a situation like that and it's better to wait more in a safe spot midfield than to be all that pushed up because you can react right or left rather than only have this area to cover and have to go all the way back when it's not in that area so it's a good example of what i mean by how those are bad habits but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time this you guys are watching this let me know how this works for you if you guys try this work on it for like a week or two try to go down your list of bad habits try to work on one per day during rank whatever it may be yeah let me know how you guys feel about this kind of video if you guys want to see more like this you guys want to see more um strictly like tip based videos let me know guys love y'all see you on the next [Music] how could i trust you when you hurt me
