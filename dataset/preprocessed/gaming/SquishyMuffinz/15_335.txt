a million subs before the end of the year and if you're brand new here as well hit that subscribe button also press the bells notified when I upload a brand new video and yeah let's make history guys be the second rock of the youtuber to milk love y'all enjoy yoga so guys are back up some more Road to grand champ for today and the last one we finished off at champion 1 division 4 so we're getting closer and closer to champ - now I think today we should reach it forget two wins so let's get into it probably catch some dubs let's go alright so for the first year played against two players who were super super close to champ - if higher MMR than me right now and we're playing a dude who's also champ 1 so it's full champ what lobby two of them are really close to champ two though I should take in that Boosh from that guy I'm gonna wait the challenge is my teammate just died so I know I have to wait so I could support him I don't want to just get thrown in for a challenge here my teammate has to like get lucky on his spawn I'll get tried he's trying to block his shot that's reasonable if you had waited over than a free goal cuz I didn't miss it stay on the wall here so where the ball could really get was on the wall just give it back to me good decent 50 my teaming up a free ball so not a big deal wait and going here wait really far back in goal see I momentum so anything they shoot here I could jump to and get easily if I'm right here and a bunker shot behind me I have to awkwardly jump back to this but alright my teammate to God he's just carrying but if I'm back like this I could turn I have so much momentum to challenge any ball that gets shot at me it's better to position yourself further back in the goal it's a really big tip they go for a very basic edge over here something crazy I just want to see if it works okay I tried to make it like a sloppy it's like good just to see if it work and the guy on the ceiling missed like they just ignored that guy and the guy in there god I tried to touch it around him but yeah really good dribble for my teammate to start it off get us going into this game alright so for this bow I'm just gonna pop it up on goal it's fun good blocking on the might even have that he's going with momentum toward the ball I'm gonna check no one's here it's not gonna panic and I'll just boom this downfield they're probably gonna miss realistically see I can just finish it off nothing crazy user rights taken a situation like that so I don't panic in to set the ball away check if he's there if he's not there I know I'm good to go I can I could think about where I want the ball next you don't have that panic of if someone is or is not gonna be there ever my team in on the water him I messed him up but he's not gonna go so I hit off the back to see what they do keep my boost and I'll stay middle here nice challenge holy my teammates actually kind of nuts what the hell I think he's using a scene I mean picture that's funny he's repping alright one touch I'm just gonna pop it let's see Oh there we go though nothing crazy at all literally it's a little a little chip shot on goal let him panic it's a it's a pretty bad area that was a problem he didn't fast jump he double jump with any boosts it she's gonna be so into the ball and his area was gonna be awkward so again that's something that I think the best way to solve that I just try to sing a free play no better practice and just trying to get a feel for how your car works in free play without having anyone bother you gonna leave that cuz they're gonna beat me on the wall there so I'll wait first touch can't really do much in this situation so hop it up I'll go for a simple double touch shoot very slow merely just to beat the first guy there my teammate was up as well a check players don't seem as like solid as I thought they would good toss the shot on but I want to like energy ball the way I want to see how they react to it take the boosts and I'll leave nice challenge a challenge again close all that I hit this away to me you need it again so I just wait if they're close to the ball a good rule to have just mentally is just waiting for them if you're if you're not definitely gonna be the to the ball don't even go unless you can at least get a fifty on it and then is different but like here they're closer for sure so I'm just gonna wait again I can't beat him I have to turn all the way around to beat him so after this fake challenge there that's how I view that on defense that's my my thought process where should I be as annoying as possible really try to kill this guy there we go try kill this guy as well there you know if I kill SMG guy again made him jump to make it try to dribble them get her throats of demos on your way back I was like excessively demoing right there but that was good for my teammates again anyway I was very very good I go for a simple I dribble again just tap it one more time I'm keeping my car like a stiff as possible try not to do too much movement oh okay this one it's a little excessive I'll go back yeah it's very easy to practice as a nutribullet I think I think there are translators that can do it right or the tree up there I know he can't have that many options that situation he has a very tight angle the shoes from so it's just kind of free jumping over to the best but it's gonna be hard from the two cut wide around that and get a low shot I know that sighs pre jumped it I thought maybe behind me to be on his study and while like go all in for the challenge but I want at least four stab all the way I think it might have turned toward this might even the problem I didn't but he wasn't he didn't use this boost to get behind me no but I could have definitely won the challenge but the first guy really his main goal in twos is just to force the ball out even if he can't directly win the challenge just forced the dribble away so we're per had ball control doesn't have it anymore and they just have to make an easy save all right I want to show you guys I'm at like how useful a challenging is here ever dribble there we go I don't they do anything and they threw the ball away to my teammate here we go a good example again use a challenge I get back now also have a really good idea for a series I've been down this road to grand shape one guys so I can't wait to get that one started it includes using this account as well but I'm not gonna give it away quite yet but I really like the idea I think it's would be really funny but it's like a secondary road to grand champ but it's gonna be gonna be a little comedic a little bit of a twist to it well I wasn't get the double it's so close oh yeah that's for after the series then we're not too far off completing this series to be honest what player will put my teammate was was really solid I like the way he is playing for the most part it was pretty good where that makes us wait doesn't make any sense nightshade was champ too at 1289 MMR I'm at 12:19 I'm champ 1 Wow how does that work it's really weird alright whatever we're gonna get to the next one if we win it will be champ two for sure that's pretty solid we're at 12 9 and now we got 22 points from that and we still get to lose a game of the series so let's see if we can keep that up into the next one B I really saw it first game let's get into it let's see how it goes alright what the hell for the second game we got ourselves a 736 MMR employer and then two champ ones but I think the 736 player is 100% of SMERSH so we'll see how this goes we might have to counter smear for the first time little chipper oonski's I like first touch here alright nevermind he's not that he's not that good that Ariel kind of gave it away didn't like double jump to it he just uh it's like he did this even like faster than me did double jump quick oh no all right I can't be goofing off like this we got Jam Bushido so I think we're good to go yeah just use the goat let's take some shots on goal say they react to it alright you show up on the ball out yeah this guy's not bad at all he's a hundred percent not not his rank oh my bad teammate to be honest I didn't see him nor did I hear him until he was like a right next to me in the air I know I can shoot that ball yeah let's do this do the hundred percent hundred percent history I don't think this this guy's like boosting him I think they're just friends or something and this guy's smoking for fun I don't know you might have to go a little bit more charge just getting the dub well I wish the end there I still don't want to blow my cover you try from Jambu ski I was a bang I'll trust my teammate banging that suit happens there we go and my favorite did miss that that error there but the thing is he didn't need to jump that earlier that's a problem I see a lot to you this ring you will panic when they don't need to panic like you could have just waited for the bounce like I did and just dribbled it but everyone thinks that everyone is so ready for everything but it's not the not the case especially in this drink people aren't in the right positions a lot of the time what's up said around him and I'll go back now did my part what's he making go next should go next not a table touch cha takes up the wall you see more options when you go up the wall like that and I go for some a dribble around them yeah if you have time I go there's no point of just panicking and hitting it back to them cuz gonna be waiting around the corner for your touch so play up the wall I'll look for your options it my team it was middle I would have passed him but it wasn't so he's gonna solo though I didn't get bumped might have been a goal but it's all gonna fake challenges Judy does get the ball away like I said it's normally how it goes you're playing people in the shrink you got a chance with him though he also forced me to do a little bit of a pop there got back off again I have time so maybe I'm gonna go up the wall you consider just playing it to them for free give me at the free goal good try though the same situation before they're like you have that time they're like me should have definitely not make that the wallet quick but it's fine because you still use this time wall on the wall you really gotta learn to use the walls when you have have the space to do so again just a little fake challenge make them do the ball back this team is gonna go but it's fine I could just wait for his touch fine gonna have a touch here I shot a block I can grab the boost and it's perfect you may get a shot got playoff that seem like a pass thank you lady for his touch there yeah soon as I saw that he didn't get a good shot of that I tried to react off of it and get a shot so his bad shine did I turn into a pass pretty much but I wouldn't be able to be there if I didn't hold my boost and stay middle and that that's a really important thing to you like I'm always almost always on offense trying to remain in like the center of the field some extent with full boost that way you could react to any kind of play and you kind of play any situation that ends up developing can you mess up his touch their rights here it's a bold through side thing so very tough spot to be in for me but you got a bit never really want to take both boosts unless you're stealing it from the opponent but I don't think he was in that case maybe I'm wrong in the clinic got it okay BAE necessity does probably miss let's take a touch sheet of control don't flick pull there we go again I could have just shot that and the same situation still works in this right like super consistently banging it high on the ground they're not comfortable with the reads if people don't pre position on backboard which is a thing that I think you'll start seeing in like champ 3 but pre positioning on the backboard makes any like super fast shot with way easier to save you'll you'll definitely know this yeah that should be our promotion game you got 18 points off of that it sucks gonna get any points that guy was on a smurf but then again we're also on a Smurfs account so he can't really complain we got the champ to you though pretty solid stuff and I was doing a little bit more than I would normally try to do just because if we lost that tooth that was honest perfect cat we already downed like two three goals but if we lost that dude that was on a Smurfs account we would have lost so many points and I think it's so much longer to get to its a great shape because of that anybody like lost or win streak so it a gain like no points per game after that yeah we got to camp two off of that we are cap to did one 1308 where you finished off at pretty pretty solid stuff all around can't complain can't complain but I think I'm gonna end that there that way for the next video it'll be nothing but champ to players that are playing against I'm pretty sure then we have a better view of them if we don't get like what we noticed mixed up too much but I still honestly up the champ one I've seen a lot of the same things and it's just slowly about getting more and more consistent and I can tell the players getting more consistent but they're still lacking the same things at the lower ranks were lacking and it's just a consistency and being able to read the ball where the ball is going to end up and just when the ball is in awkward situations not panicking like if the ball is bouncing off the wall in a weird way they'll jump awkwardly instead of waiting for it to bounce onto their car like have a good understanding of where the opponents are and if they're rushing you if they're not and they're not rushing you didn't use your time wisely if they are rushing either trying to get it around them but that's that's a big thing that I see that no one has done so far honestly except for accepted that one guy on the wall and I think it was in this video where I was waiting for his touch and he actually went down the wall with zero boost and controlled into the corner I really like that play a lot instead of panicking and hitting away thinking I'm gonna go for that ball that was smart that was only the first time they've seen someone actually smartly try to get a defense in these lower ranks so that's a lot of the issues I see and it's just like very easy very very simple defensive mistakes that that could be fixed so easily so that's the good news if you are in these ranks they're not things that take very long to fix it's just a matter of consistency in your mechanics and and the read of the game which if you really watch back your replays you'll notice what you're doing wrong quite often and you'll notice your spacing is probably not that great probably really close to TNA when you shouldn't be and you're not giving them an option middle when you should be so these are the things you should look at those are the main takeaways that I have up the champ one so far so yeah hopefully for the next video we'll start seeing a big boost in consistency and shantu and yeah I'm sorry if I'm doing too much like let me know I'm trying to have a good balance of playing like a champ one but also trying to think like a pro player would and I think mechanically I'm doing slightly too much but it's it's hard to find the good balance for me I'm really trying my best but that's why you guys are really gonna like this second series after I've done this road of grand champ yes we're really gonna love this next feat because I can just go all out but there's a twist to it there's a twist don't worry it's not just gonna be be mean like destroying people with nothing else there's a twist to it there's a challenge to it you'll see it's a really good series idea I really loved it and I think you guys a little bit as well so it'll be the the next series that I have after this one but let's get this one out the way and I'm really curious to see how champ 2 & 3 is gonna be we're really close to finish it now we're getting super super close so yeah thank you for all the support lately on the channel like the subs
