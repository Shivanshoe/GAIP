yo what is up guys so rocket league season three just came out today as you can see this is the brand new starting menu that you end up getting popped up with we got ourselves all of our rewards actually have a look at these these are all rocket boosts i don't think i'll be using any of these because alpha boost is obviously hard to beat it's hard to beat in terms of uh beauty got ourselves our titles season 2 super sonic legend not too shabby is rocket pass out there's a new rock pass okay let's look i actually didn't know what to expect from this because honestly i didn't read any of the the updates or anything that was coming out in this season so i'm gonna be going through the first time with you guys right now so let's see if there's anything cool i'll probably buy up to uh tier 40 to 50ish depending on what the best tier is and uh probably use maybe one of the new cards for this video as well so we'll see we'll get into that in a sec though just go through all the items see what the the best stuff is that's pretty clean you wear nice little helmet oh yeah i don't think i'll be wearing one of those but this car looks really nice not gonna lie this car looks like it'll be a dominant hitbox most likely maybe a hybrid hitbox like breakout something like that some of these decal is not too bad what is this thing oh the harbinger i don't know if i'm saying that right oh this kind of clean fisherman hat kinda go hard need more octane decals man decals are used for octane hopefully there's some sick wheels in this too diamond plate that's kind of clean it doesn't really look like diamond but probably find the right color combination to make it look like it all right this one's got some potential they have some potential i'm not gonna lie use them with the right stuff maybe they could be uh good wheels i might experiment with these let's see it's a clean domino stick out not bad we need some like crazy wheels though man something crazy hasn't been too crazy so far let's see there oh this is interesting it's weird got some potential i like this avasar border it's clean it's kind of clean as well it's all like racing themed seems like these are weird these are very weird looking tune sketch this new that's gotta clean it that's new i think it's new this is weird as well looking probably won't use these wheels this is kind of nice as well i don't know this one's nice this one's nice i think i would use this i could see myself using that for sure these wheels okay these have some serious potential to be used i could see like very high level players using this because it's a kind of like clean wheel that probably feels nice to play with but also looks pretty nice and it's more about the feel than the look to be honest a lot of the time with the wheels but the look does help obviously most of the wheels to see how the people using look a lot like this like clean sleek treads and stuff like that makes the game feel really nice when you use wheels like this so these are wheels i'm probably going to be using to be honest they need some nice like boost though man there's no like sick boost in any of these for people i'm not going to use anything else other than alpha boost but like would be nice they had some more this isn't bad either i don't know i don't know how i feel about the goal explosion all right these are cool wheels like in design i guess but the way they actually look the way like the chunkiness of them already like this car looks nice i was actually more than 70 tears oh no just shows you well it looks clean my dog's clean those wheels that looks crazy that kind of goes hard though damn i might have to experiment with these all right so that's going to be the the rocket pass what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to the beginning here and we're we're gonna get this car right here and we're gonna try it for ourselves because not sure what to expect here it looks like a dominus dominus e hitbox i'm not exactly sure what it is but i'm gonna try it for ourselves so i'm gonna get that real quick all right so we got ourselves the new car we equip it looks pretty clean not gonna lie but this nice little little paint job on it if you guys want the colors i put on this this blue this orange this red this blue with anodized pearl on the first um also guys there's a brand new setting if you go to the settings and go to video there's no more fps slider so you have to change this yourself if you have a 360 hertz monitor use 360 240 hertz 240 144 et cetera 60. use the best thing for what you have you can also uncap i don't really recommend uncapping though i think it's better to stick to what your your refresh rate is but yeah we're on 360 fps now which is pretty sick so let's get into the first games of the brand new season we have nothing played so far as you can see zero zero zero zero gonna be playing some of our games for today my first games of the new season let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we're playing jacobias jacobias i know how to say his name but this is who we're playing so we'll see this is jacob i don't know like that old pro jacob i don't have the pinch it's fine here's the plate is into me here it's a little bit awkward for him i have all the net blocking situations it's almost better to let him play it into me in a situation like that it's not a scary spot for me to be in my opinion because the only thing you can really do is fake get a fifth to the corner kick off i'm gonna get back to this take a touch here let's take a power shot see he does there we go those are so tough to stop it might look really simple right the good thing about those is you stay grounded the whole time so if they do save it you have advantage on the next ball and you grab some boost off of it perfect is actually quite nice though one of the better long cars i've used in a while it's actually quite smooth feeling i don't know how to explain it i think it's like the turning the whole game in general feels a lot more smooth since the update you're so scary wait for go for a fake challenge here yes i'll flip it away i could probably just finish this off potentially there we go it's really good to go for like a fake ceiling challenge there because it makes them throw away their flip the scary part in a situation like that is dealing with their flip and how long they'll have it for so you can deal with that early by by biting on a fake challenge the best way to deal with that situation this kick off this thing is really good single jumping and then he gets a wave dash off of it as well to get kicked off recover a little bit off of it challenge early big challenge i'm gonna fake jump here like i think i'm going i made him back off a little bit which is good which gives me the next boost not gonna stay in front he has no boost here so i'm gonna get this one i'm gonna try to turn on this i can panic a little bit i was gonna play from him i was gonna play for him i didn't think he had boobs but he must have been saving 12. he had enough to speed up the ball and get into a dangerous spot i got to be greedy for the boost his kickoffs are insane this guy is the best hero i've ever seen but also could because i'm on a long car long cars for one's kickoffs are really bad been a very messy game so far and i'm sure it won't get any better if i don't fix my kickoff because not a very um pleasant way to start off each kickoff for each starting sequence having a rush to get boosts and them having advantage the whole time but if you could practice your kickoff guys one of the most important things about ones if you do want to get into ones personally i don't like ones anymore i used to a long time ago but definitely lost passion for once a while back let's see on the ball here let's play it back still full control in situation played across he's kind of in the spot where he has to touch this one time and i'm still going to have possession off the touch so it's not a bad situation for me to be in and that's pretty fortunate that i landed on him there to be honest i wasn't looking for the demo but if it came it came try to get this to the right side maybe he did the exact same pickup as me and wanted exactly how i wanted to win it and now the situation becomes very tough to save okay just because he has possession i'll kick off how much pressure he got on me just because of that right if he played that a little bit better it's probably a goal straight off of it to be honest he still kind of has pressure because he's not leaving was forced to leave on that one 50 here is good enough i'd say especially because i saved some boost on that dude that one probably a goal obviously to shoot here i think that could really do i guess the wrong way i never get lucky but i guess like that i tried to return my wheels right or left i guess the wrong way kickoffs are really annoying against this dude though i feel like every kickoff i've been in a really bad situation shortly after this isn't just insane you get fake from him there we go the drive challenge was smart there because again we stay grounded so worst case scenario he bangs it into us and we get the advantage out of it better kick off maybe i should delay my care off more i think sometimes a little bit too fast hurts me a bit fake again there we go always works so the big thing here is threatening my flip the whole time i'm coming down off the ceiling and then threatening the fact that i can hit the ball again off the second jump so using my speed toward the ball and the fact that i'm close to the ball the whole way through to my advantage there best way to put that situation out fake here fake again see what he does she's gonna challenge early on that now and i can just go again last time i tried to shadow all the way back to my corner and he saved some boost played it well so i don't want to let that happen again cut it out early don't make the same mistake twice it's not bad to make mistakes i think that's the thing that people like misunderstand it's not a bad thing to make mistakes not a bad thing to lose necessarily but you have to you know react to that loss or react to that mistake in the right way and actually try to learn from it and not look at it as such a negative thing because if you always have that mindset that you're trying to learn from the mistakes you're making you'll always get better it's always the case never look at mistakes or losing in a negative light it's always a lesson i feel like that's the way i always look at it in this game and even in other even other stuff in life as well you can look at it that way no boost getting launched away so i'll play from him again honestly it's isn't a bad position from back on kickoff again like he always wins the boost because of the way tea out goes so something i definitely need to work on see that's perfect right there because he has to chase me down here and now i have possession no matter what even if he has the ball on my side i have boost and i have possession so again threaten to flip the whole way down that was well played good patience from him oh i wanted to try something crazy i want to try something absolutely crazy i was trying to get a pinch that skims off the bottom of my car you kind of see i'm doing pin just skims off the bottom of my car like forward into his net maybe i wasn't trying to get like a simple touchscreen corner or anything although i could have i was trying to get a crazy goal out of that i got i got that in uh free play using backus model one time like i jumped for the the backbone rebound accidentally skimmed it off the left side of my car like this all the way into the other net so i was trying to do it there but chances of me hitting that would have only ever hit it once and it was an accident probably pretty low but good first game though let's get into the next one so even keep it up he's already supersonic legend this guy so that must have been really good points for us how are you already super sonic legend that's crazy this guy's been grinding once this season already seen the next one seem to keep it up and get back to back dubs let's see how it goes my matchmaking pretty much died i tried to find another one's game it just didn't let me so that already just q2's here we are take a touch here can i turn on this i'm not sure how low the elo is here to be honest but i see some boosts people normally wouldn't use i'm on a us west server because like i said i couldn't find a game for like 15 minutes and it's a brand new season so you gotta do what you gotta do car feels quite nice honestly in my opinion i think this is a car that you guys could definitely use i think it'd be better for twos and threes than it would be for once because then once your kickoff will almost always get destroyed i feel like by an octane if you're a longer car it's very tough to win a kickoff in my opinion but uh yeah started off with the goal here it does feel really nice like i said i think the turning radius feels super clean i also think it makes it feel super nice the way the turning feels this to the side take time on this i have control of the bounce like i still fall off the next situation here play this around onto the left side like i pass this middle to my teammate should be able to do something with that there we go it's my way to play out the first guy because the first guy's going to be expecting the mid pass right so you play to the left to get around one isolate the wobbly one situations and you eventually have yourself a free goal stuff is so laggy though i hate having to play on wes because the kickoff especially kind of flies one way and then dies that's what happened there so not used to reading that like that i just played with such a bad lag i don't know how i used to do i used to play at 300 ping all the time and i was fine but it's been so long not having that that it's weird to play with now it's a little bit of lag it's a very awkward spot to be in surprise he backed out of that i was actually beneficial for him to stay that was the last man back in the situation this gun's a little bit awkward for me now i gotta just wait i'm gonna fake jump here make him think i'm throwing it away single jump challenge teammate has free ball here it's a good spot for me to be in good 50. head back for the boost here good challenge i like that he drove into that he stays on it leaving a mid boost up for my teammate because he's gonna want to grab that in a sec most likely nice it's fine i'll let him go again doesn't really matter too much try to just wait back here safely good spot kills all danger in the air dribble really good seven covering both options gotta take my time on a shot there wasn't a bad idea can't get back to this if it's in that's just unfortunate that's just unfortunate he missed a wide open net that's just actually very unlucky to be honest there's a wide open net and it hits the perfect post bounce so that way i'm trying to read it it goes straight into me that's so unfortunate man chalk it up to it happens move on teammate should have this and he could spot for it wow i tried an insane angle there it was close why though kind of unnecessary on the touch there but if i had a weighted ground it would have worked just didn't think he'd go again run for some insane angles yeah i'm telling you these long cars that's the biggest downside of them to me is they make me want to freestyle because it looks so damn nice octane looks so whatever that doesn't matter what you do you know doesn't really want to make you do anything wants to make you play solid octane this car makes you want to just jump around have a good time if you want to have a good time i recommend this car for sure i'm not sure my teammate's going for any of these balls you should be that makes it very awkward all right this is yeah this is very low you though i feel like it has to be 1600 or something grandchildren born in grand champ too something like that that's what it feels like i don't know i feel like their team isn't but my team might be yeah because the way like everyone's turning it's it's bad for sure this is a weird lobby well you can expect out of your placement games there it's good delayed i'm gonna take again there we go i have all that high space to potentially go for a high shot so you have to worry about that right take a touch you have all the control again fake the high touch and go flying over you they have to block the high you could just delay your flip and go low your clip is your best friend in this game playflip is that they're scary that's why ceiling shots are scary because you save your flip all that time so longer you can save your flip the more threatening the play you have is going forward yeah this is rough guys this is rough for sure this should never ever ever be a goal so i'm baiting it for him should be an easy should be easy to save for the last man back happens you'll learn from it right we're in hilo hell right now hey yeah yeah yeah okay starting to look on window bowl starting flicking one of a but 44 seconds right you know as long uh it's fine it's fine it's fine we're good happens to the best of us these guys he's got a probably ssl and my teammate definitely was not that's a last season but that makes sense because the game's trying to give them a fair a fair lobby yeah yeah yeah i don't even know how we were close to winning this to be honest but we did a good job we did a good job for the most part and all you can ask for we have 24 seconds i don't think there's any chance of this one going our way but definitely happens definitely does happen unfortunate that's gonna be here for today's video though guys even though this one was pretty bad and off on it's gonna be it sometimes you get games like this and you know you have to you have to go hard you have to go hard on your leaves it's just that simple either you either go absolutely off or you just get destroyed because there's no chance i feel like it's because of the new season i'm guessing these guys are both ssl i wonder if i can turn on my back and spawn and check the other probably both ssl last season and my teammate probably was grand champ too maybe maybe grand champ one making a lot of a lot of mistakes like ssl players would not make um anyway it doesn't really matter i don't i don't care all that much to be honest it was fun though either way hope you guys enjoyed and i hope you guys see that even i get games sometimes that are very tough to win and you gotta just move on is what it is doesn't really matter at all to be honest you move on get some more dubs not much to take from that game to be honest outside of a few unlucky things and the fact that the lobby was probably a little bit unbalanced but outside of that we had fun and we had a good first ones game tuesday game was good too they played well give credit but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are watching this as for the car i do recommend it for twos and threes it would be okay for threes for sure um twos and ones though it's questionable questionable for one's for sure two's not bad though but definitely not a bad car by any means turning radius feels nice looks super nice for me i can't use it because it looks too damn sexy because when cars look sexy like this i just want to fly around all game and it makes me play a little bit different but uh yeah either way if you guys enjoyed see us on the next one i love y'all peace you
