yo what's up guys getting playing experience today with gimmick my old teammate and com who is the person that ended up replacing me when i left to nrg and uh they got time everyone as well obviously nt9 is no longer in the game but i'm gonna be playing with these two for today should be some games i've actually never played with calm before played for obviously like four or five years with gimmicks so i know how to play with them pretty well but it'll be a new experience for sure should be some fun games let's get into our placements hopefully they're fun hopefully they're enjoyable let's see how it goes all right first game got ourselves beach emc and spade for some reason comes name is sneaky staircase let's see how this goes try to challenge quick here i respect that guys he's got the c9 decal on looking clean down to the ground here if i pass over the chairman i absolutely love that ball i don't have a quick chat i don't think right now i gotta turn it back on should i pass this down nice i don't know what just happened there i feel like that was out but we'll take it let's get past that good job to hit the ceiling should i win the left mid boost yeah that passed earlier where i launched the game's head the idea was good execution was uh bad though because it was way too fast it was just never going to be a shootable ball good try from good calm i'm going to at least be there we can have an attempt on net gotta pop this one up and go again now get a kill which is good now like maybe pass to me down field oh my i tried something crazy over some absolutely bonkers is the word i'll use put this off the wall oh that's actually a really good idea i like the idea that a lot i've never really done something like that right idea for sure keep on saying sorry shook that a habit but it's not even going through unlucky there's a lot of open space to the right side of the field so i try to play over to calm and compete attached to dribble there but i got beat on the the next pass and because me and gimmick had double committed originally i made a situation a little bit awkward so i played this down to gimmick should be fine play middle go for a bump maybe kill them which is good i go for one more bump looking for the mid guy here kind of force him to throw it away as well another plus about that damn good save to be back post well done from them should be easy for calm loss back here i played around one almost played around two that weird touch behind him it beat from gimmick play off the wall i'm back walking play it's a gimmick again back mid.com i like the idea let's get a pass play it was weird it's a good one though word isn't always bad especially in this game i think weird is actually good sometimes because it'll throw people off quite a bit good play good pass from gimmick was a perfect height on the pass so it gave me a lot of opportunity to do whatever i wanted to with it just took a hard shot in the middle of the net i think it's the best way to go about that situation because absolute worst case scenario they hit it to the left the right corner and it's kind of safe for them but at the same time you have the next advantage on the next challenge it's almost best case scenario for you every single time by just playing it down the middle if they save it it's always going to be good for you next up should be fine play to the corner move forward here i don't know why i decided to make that as hard as possible to shoot but i did and uh definitely looked cooler because of it but a lot easier than it then i made it out to be i should say hitters got above the ball rolled it in playing this down to gimmick you might be able to beat them my fault i'm not sure honestly if he was able to just 50 me there if i had 50 to i feel like it would have probably destroyed me either way and i was lost back for a bit i tried to fake him instead of going for the challenge i'll leave me out of position so i was playing for the next touch to be safe as well just a tough spot to get out of to be honest could have played it better though good safe gimmick should be that's fine actually couldn't shoot i think it was a little too far be it's behind good save definitely awkward still got out of it quite well i got the the back boost as well which is huge good try on the touch from calm day but it's off the sidewall for gimmick might be best case scenario for a shot potentially at least set up a decent play for us there we go always going to create a lot of pressure on them there nice fast touch good follow-up from gimmick and good follow-up at the end there to secure the goal all right good first game still in our placement games but we are very high up on the leaderboards already like you can check your mmr using backups mod rat like 1700 or something like that it's really grand champ two i think grand champ three something like that already let's get to the next game though it's even keep it up get back to my dubs let's see how it goes all right for last time we got ourselves sea bass keep the skill and uh lunar see this goes it fall up off the bat i wait for gimmick here i'm third so i'll play a little bit deeper just in case he gets beat should be okay for me to follow this up now good 50 to make just gonna try to pre-jump this fun if it gets over me to be honest kind of expecting it to get over me in a situation like that or about just keeping the pressure i play a weird form let me go back here don't want to get in the way of his air drill but if he decided to pass me i would have stayed as soon as i saw that he didn't i wanted to just back off i didn't want to mess him up it's okay to go for a solo play back there too it's not i wouldn't call that selfish i think it's a matter of your judgment in that moment if you think it's better to solo play go for it if you think it's better to pass go for it you gotta trust each individual's judgment especially the highest level should in theory know what's best for your situation try to go for left mid here i wasn't sure if you had it look a little bit awkward so i was trying to stay just in case you missed actually pretty good for us they have to hit it away again should be fine build one which is really big here open up a little bit of space for gimmick to work with now the whole left side of the field's open could be able to do something with this oh i didn't think he'd go it's on me thought he'd he was leaving should be fine though way back full boost try to support him mid here off the wall he wants to stay okay i think he flipped away so i like to do normally for those someone's gonna be challenging that first touch for him so i like to hit off the wall back to him and it creates a lot of space most of the time so i like doing that that rotella back here that's it done i don't know what happened but we'll take it yeah i like to hit it off the wall the sidewalls are your friends for sure in threes and twos banging off the sidewall is actually really good if you know where somebody is like if you know where the first guy challenging is sidewalls are really useful and ones obviously don't want to do it's gonna get you scored on more often than not but in team based game modes definitely a very good option good win from gimmick i'm just gonna challenge this get a bump on him that's just getting as hitting the ball to be honest because you see the situation that comes out of it right if i had fitted this it would have been even more unpredictable and we went either left or right or to the ceiling would have been very hard for me to get but me bumping him there even if the ball gets over me is actually best case scenario because it goes to gimmick freely there's no one that can follow up the challenge and leaves a lot of space for the past to come out and a lot of space in the shot as well because he's still bumped he's still floating and trying to recover it i'll be actually forfeited early i might have to do one more a little bit too quick for my liking good second game let's get into the next one a little bit too quick so we'll get into one more see if we can get back to back to backwind for today let's see how it goes all right for the last last game we got a sweaty game here we got vegas alpha kept and yolks see how this goes you make sure to have couldn't beat him honestly it should have been straight up gotta put it to the ceiling there chances of me getting a straight up shot of that was pretty low that's probably legal unfortunate that's exactly what i was talking about earlier you can't get a shot on goal on me there so he just plays it straight to the ceiling and there's not much i can do if i'm lost back i can wait but if i wait he's gonna see that i'm waiting and make a better play so it's definitely a weird situation to be in as well played from him it's a good win there i'm trying the shot all right so this guy's actually doing a good job the vegas guy's actually doing a good job of just playing it around people when he has a chance to it's the best way to play a lot of situations because you can't just shoot everything you try to go for didn't really shoot out that was a little unfortunate misread where the 50 might end up trying to turn a little bit off to the side not where i would have wanted to nice good play good play a lot of space to work with there so you want to go for the shot there's three stacking net pretty much i had one middle so using him there is a smart play to make the safer play to make and the smarter play to make very careful honestly all the players on our team are doing a good job of hitting it around in spots for most people would just take a bad shot so got to give them credit for that yeah this is the high uh ssl lobby from last season that's expected but even higher more players only make that mistake it's a very common one to make taking shots when you should go for passes instead or just hits around the opponent it's okay to take a bad shot sometimes too if you know you can follow up the next touch very underrated skill i think nice sorry about that steam scene messages getting spammed a little bit i don't know how to turn them off oh my that was crazy really good shot from gimmick that's really smart to do because a lot of people think that you're gonna maybe go for a musty flick or something when you do that he backed off unfortunately he backed off like this right so you have the opportunity to flip backward if you want to but instead of that he just double jump down to the ground so you get back down to the ground quicker like this right so you're faking the flick but you also get down to the ground a little bit quicker so it gives you more of the advantage you have to wait on what you're going to do even harder thought i'd kill the mid guy here how about my team it's turning very weird very hard to read so i'll just wait head off the gimmicks wall maybe open yeah just in like that so again i have space on the ball here right why am i just going to bang this away i know gimmicks close i'm going to play soft to the wall give me an opportunity to make a play on the ball and you did and we got a free go out of it they made a mistake somewhere in the rotation it shouldn't have been open but that's the best way to put a situation out again using the space using the time you have wisely is the name of the game in threes i'm gonna fake this one i don't want to go for this much better for the guy facing the ball he sees all the options he can use on the field pass over the gimmick try to keep it i wasn't sure if it was back to me or for somebody else middle and there was someone else middle obviously hard for me to know that what i'm just guessing nice pass down the gimmick gonna have some options off that now all right i'm lost back for a little bit so my goal now is to kill time for my team i want a fake challenge here defending this as if i'm playing safe for my team to get back right i don't want to dive early give them a free opportunity on the ball and play this down the middle maybe that's fine that effectively does the same thing plays it down to my teammate regardless i don't mind when they make touches off the walls like that because that's another way of passing middle pretty much so that's definitely me winning that challenge regardless we still gotta go out of it exactly what i'm saying so losing a bollock down there or having someone beat you to the ball if it's a bad touch for their team to follow up it's not necessarily a bad thing it's not always a bad thing to have the ball go past you if it goes back to your teammates go off the wall to the left or right if you're on their side it goes back to your teammates as long as your teammates are positioned accordingly you'll always get the advantage out of it so yeah hope you guys enjoyed good games today we're six out of ten for our placement games
