yo what's up guys so one of the previous videos i asked you guys what you'd like to see in the next few videos and a lot of you guys were telling me to try the new car from this rocket pass called the harbinger as you can see it's on the front of the car right there and uh i haven't done a video with it yet so i decided why not let's do it it does look interesting i'm pretty sure this is the octane hitbox it could be the market box i'm not 100 sure on that but it's one of those two it should feel okay i'm guessing i haven't actually tried it yet but let's get into a few 1v1 games for today and let's see if we can get some dubs i did by the way reach supersonic legend in 3x3 while i was streaming i wasn't able to record the final moments of reaching it but yeah we reached it in all three game modes finally so let's get straight into 1v1 with this car hopefully it's really good i think it'll be good let's get into it let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing against gypsier see we can do using a fennec i do wonder what hitboxes is let me know down below in the comments if any of you guys do know what it is actually very curious i can't tell from the free play that i tried it i really can't tell what it is try controls down to the ground and you always want to stay grounded in ones you don't want to do anything that's going to be too much of a risk might get you immediately scored on you always want to try to play for boost as well all the things we're going to be trying to do first set a bad touch from him i can just toss it up high i don't have to go for this ball really he's going to probably panic i could just shoot low and there we go do you want to separate yourself enough from the ball there and hold on to the boost that you do have that way regardless of what he does if it gets to the left or right you can react to it and if he misses of course you could be there to clean up the goal get pre-flipped to get back there he's going to get that boost and grab some pads it might be a shot i have to be careful of this really tough spot to get out of probably in a vehicle good job from him that's all really down to that boost steel if he gets that boost it's gonna be a goal for him what does he get pre-flip to recover out of the kickoff his chaos much better than mine it seems [ __ ] off the bat try to go for the bump you got a free go off kick off again which is fine i'm okay with giving up those goals doesn't feel like you get outplayed feels like you have a lot of comeback potential regardless how many of those you give up put this down take one touch toss it up try to get a good shot on goal there we go that fake infield there he has to respect it that's why he didn't challenge me he has to respect the fact that i could get that mid so he has to try to cover all the options that's why it's a really tough spot to be in put us back to my own side hopefully get this boost could be dangerous now okay we're good i had to be careful in case he demoed me that was the only only fear i really had there of that almost got to save it was a good idea to be patient there yeah kickoffs are really messing me up right now for the most part that's one thing that i have to try to start winning in this game because he's getting a a lot of ball possession just off kickoff like right here he's getting the boost i have to back off right that's gonna win you a game if you get that every single time something that i definitely have to start winning in this game or else it's going to be tough to get a dub here i think i'm going to start slowing down kick off a little bit so i'm not used to the hitbox of the car so to try to get used to it slow down a little bit shall learn how it a works bit better because i can win the kick off here get the boost play it back get the other boost he has to back off of this he can't jump for this obviously doesn't have any boost for it it's pretty good for us might go up i can get the boost as well let's find backflip out of it demo would be huge there there we go now we have full ball control a lot of time let's take a couple slip touches forward here should be able to get back played off the wall good job from him to stay on that but again that's a tough spot to be in because he can't really get anything going forward he's just trying to stop me from getting an attack right so he did that pretty well there made my my life a lot tougher by just trying to challenge me there even though he did get killed i'm gonna go for a fake kick off here i think he's been winning the kickoffs a lot so try to make him give us the ball that's fine if you have to touch that it's okay might have slaughtered it there we go i still can't tell what hitbox this car is it doesn't feel bad though i will say that it just feels really wide i think for some reason i think this might be the market box it doesn't feel like octane i could just be completely wrong on that but it does not feel like octane feels higher than octane for me just fake that touch here that i'm hit that get a good bounce dribble pop try to stay on this with a decent amount of boost he bangs it away that's fine good for us that's good shadowing forcing me to get the bought us it's time for the ball now let's let him come to us force the retreat go for the demo here demo would have been huge probably would have been a goal straight up but still works i have all this time on the ball right pop it up once go for air dribble i bump is the best play to make here we can get it air dribbles feel so weird on this car i don't know everything about it feels weird a lot of you guys that are recommending this car in the comments said that it feels good but to me it's one of those like cars that feels like awkward to use i don't know maybe it takes a second to like get an understanding of how it feels maybe by the end of the second game of the video i'll feel better on it but as of right now i definitely picked the oxygen over this car we'll see that's the whole point of these videos though to test out these cars let you guys know what i think personally having a lot of play time obviously on a lot of different cars mainly like octane dominus and breakout those are the three that i put a lot on i kind of have an idea of what feels good what feels not so good to me but again it's all preference really some of you guys might really like this car so wouldn't say not to try it but personally i just don't see it being better than the octane so far he's gonna pre-jump that's really a tough spot to be in i think he messed up a little bit but ended up working out he went for the flip reset i don't think he got the flip reset which might have benefited him more than if he did get it i should have held onto my flip i think though defending that would have been a lot easier with my flip good defense from him i can grab this corner boost from him take the shot make him have to go back demo would be huge here i don't think i'll get it there gotta play this quick off the back wall don't touch that i'm trying to make him panic a little bit here gonna put it slow down from him should be fine i have to challenge the ball straight away i'm gonna take time on this he has just fallen rushed me i saw him rush so i gotta jump for it i still have a lot of boost here it's right on the back wall definitely easier to defend those when you still have your flip but you still end up getting the go out of it that's what i should have done last time if you just flip into those it's super easy to defend them that's why those things like in twos and threes it's not that dangerous anymore because someone just flips into it and another person just follows up the bounce that slowly goes in right so there's no danger of that in two threes but in ones if you're good at getting that 50 50 on the flip reset it's pretty much your goal every single time that's why i like in twos and threes you really got to use your team to get out of the situations you don't really see those often twos and threes for that reason because your teammates can help you right it should be over should be fine there we go that'll be the game all right good win there tough first game probably play the same guy again honestly we're really high on mario now we're obviously high super sonic legend right now so we're playing other really high players probably gonna play the same dude again let's get to the next one let's see if we can keep it up and uh see if we get two back-to-back dubs against another supersonic legend player let's get into it all right playing a different player playing a zappatos things that you say that we found this game instantly so this dude's got to be really high up on the boards probably going to be a sweaty game let's see how it goes i think he's going for mid-bitch right now he is just toss his shots who he does toss another shot on goal probably just take it oh i'm lagging out okay my pc just froze for a second i don't know if you guys even saw that on the recording or not interesting he's gonna flick see he does let's say from him let him touch that away it's good to be in a position like this where you can just make them panic over and over again obviously really good spot to be in good demo i'm just going to shoot that one low and it should be eagle that was like that and ones are obviously like extremely important at the really highest level like you get three seconds with an empty net if you're on their side it's probably going to be a goal if you could turn it in let's go for the boost here just 50 him that's fine we can go back he doesn't have the boost to follow this i know that i don't have to worry about it so i'll just play it to my boost take some soft touches let's try to slow play this here see what he does actually really good play from him pop that up there i don't know what car is using to be honest i forgot the name of it it's probably gonna try to flick this okay kind of lost control for a second if we can go back here didn't have much of a shot you have to worry about okay i see the way he defends he kind of just like tries to slow down to your pace which is smart and then as soon as he's at your pace he'll just backflip so it seems like so you'll slow down to whatever speed you're going and then just backflip after smart way to defend gonna fake that pop pick another one play to the mid boost here it's fine just blocking the pinch hold on to some pads it's not gonna think i have any boost most likely let him save that i think a backflip shot would be better there because i don't like in his school i'm not trying to shoot off that obviously i'm just trying to keep possession here's what i did just forced him to get a safe to the corner right we could still stay on the ball that's why i'm trying to shoot that on target i'm not trying to make it hard or anything i'm not trying to go all in for a perfect shot that he might save and then we get scored on we're trying to make it a shot that you know we can actually get back around and follow up the next touch let's say from us he's going back it seems gonna go for this it's fine it's gonna be a free ball for us and we're gonna have a full boost so pretty good spot to be in he's gonna shoot this again forcing him to make that touch i figured he just played his back it'd be really good for us who's still possession it's fun should i wait for the bounce down here over the ball for where he is good 50 for us good job from him oh that'd have been such a good flick it's a good idea it's fine again i'm just trying to do just a nice safe shadow behind the ball there like whenever he ends up flicking that i can just get away from me pretty easily let's get it to the corner it's not gonna be that risky good challenge for him gonna have full ball position still because look where he lands and he has no boost he's going for the corner so you want to have an eye on your opponent in a situation like that all the time swipe from here see what he does you could save the corner that means i can get his boost try to stay on there's gonna be a little boost here for sure there we go good shot nice little ground pitch we're playing this game out a lot smarter than the previous he has one shot we have 10 shots and we've had all the possession as well so can't ask for much more than that in one's game possession is pretty much everything the more possession you have the more chances you have on gold the more obviously 1v1 opportunities you'll have to get a goal right you don't want to give them more time on the ball i thought we'd try to cut out these plays earlier we're going to try to shadow him close just play to his speed make him do something once you flick the ball out of his possession i can head to my corner put the infield let's go for the flick and now we have possession again i can go for another shot just on target make him save it it's fine take our time here get behind the ball grab the boost take another shot on goal see what he does there we go if you say that to the corner obviously i'll just be able to grab the other boost keep going so i've had a lot of possession a lot of pressure playing this game a lot better this car is actually feeling better and better though as i play with it i think if i if i give it like 10 more games i'd probably feel really comfortable with it what i'm pretty sure that was going to be a goal if the game didn't do that but so i got a flip on my screen but the server said no you do not have a flip and then yeah whatever that was yeah that would have been a goal probably gotta wait for the shot it is one of those awkward situations where you gotta kind of hope and pray that they miss i'm gonna take time play this midfield instead of playing toward him one tap forward let him touch that that's fine i wanna i'm gonna go for it again so i'm just gonna bait close played well on defense though he did save a lot of my shots i think he just needed to try to keep control more a lot of these situations because every single one of these shots that he saves he does hit it to a corner but he doesn't hit it into a spot where he can follow it himself he did get one goal out of it but it was that one counter attack off that weird flippy set thing so it's not like he had a lot of pressure on us not like he had a lot of possession right whereas in the first game our opponent was doing a good job of getting that save and keeping it close right but he was just hitting the ball too far away from him on the saves this game so in your lower ranked games it's something you should definitely think of possession is almost everything so when you get a touch try to make sure it's follow-upable by yourself right so yeah it's gonna be all for this one guys i hope you enjoyed let me know if you want to see me play with any kind of car in any kind of
