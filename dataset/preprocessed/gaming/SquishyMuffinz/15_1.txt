yo what's up guys gonna be doing all three modes today whatever we get we'll play let's get into it so you can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right after that we got a threes game we got uh chavez in seoul and glock we got garrett p on our team funny chromie and myself of course just goes insole is a good player used to be a professional years ago not sure if he's uh finding a pro again or not but i'm sure he still has what it takes to at least be a very solid competitor in this match not sure how was seriously taking the game anymore but i don't used to be very very good player so we'll see this goes wide or over nice take my time here no point throwing possession here i can then come to me a bit but to left wall myself played over all of them pretty much it's a good touch from insole to get p does here it's a good block all i have to do is block it i didn't waste much boost so actually pretty good situation for us when the left here let him go again i don't have any kind of play on that i was hoping before leave it for me but it's okay off the wall oh that's just going to be a goal there's another guy there i didn't want to shut up shoot if i should have shot i've been saved okay that was the smartest player i did back there should i hit out the walk my teammate would have been the goal for sure but as well blocks from them they had someone blocking everything necessary good job from crow me actually insane play low 50 both of them and was able to keep possession fall really close he's able to get a nice pass middle gave me a lot of options a lot of time to shoot that pretty hard for me to miss that situation i played over one here should be enough two minutes can get a good play on this and go all the way back so give me some options that way if the ball gets over all my all my teammates i should be able to give use here that's fine i did more than enough there forced the ball high maybe back off a then my team may go or at least force the touch i could wait in that here shot's not going to be perfect i'm aware of that i know the shot's never going to be like absolutely perfect top corner there so i don't have to panic for it that's good to play the situation's more passive than not because often not more often than not the shot's not going to be like top corner really fast i guess something a lot of people do wrong especially when they start playing better players against the higher ranks a lot of people assume every single player is going to be perfection that's just not the case pros make a lot more mistakes than you'd think the highest level of player will still not hit that shot perfectly every single single time so definitely don't expect someone in like flat or gold to hit that every single time that's what i'm trying to say on these drinks it doesn't happen it does definitely happen but even if it's a perfect shot it's actually stable most of the time that's why i think the patient route is better more often than not very few situations you actually have to pre-jump for i think in that but most time it's pretty obvious when you do need to do the touch gotta wait though here's a big hit here again it's not gonna be a goal i'm gonna just wait nobody's gonna be able to shoot that let my team hit this forward any kind of shot and that's good there i can't get a powerful shot but i can get a shot that at least forces him to play to the corner which uh eventually get us possession anyway i think it's good trying to beat him here can't get a good touch back and kill him maybe go for one more play middle go for a bump of my way out both went that's actually really good for us so me even just writing a bump there i think might have forced him to go for that little earlier than anybody wanted if you're coming back with that that's the best way to be useful i think spreading the bump in that kind of situation and more often than not you're gonna make them panic get a touch that they at least didn't want it's a good block and every time i'm blocking these shots i'm trying to save at least 50 boosts that way i can recover quick after the fact that i'm still able to be here and get a shot out of that because i saved my boost at the right times all of what threes wow garrett p is 24 points i just realized that that's unfortunate might be a shot here from crew i try i'm just going to fake this hits it away it's fine it's not going to be the fastest touch i'm still trying to just force them to hit the ball away pretty much these situations up don't have any boost here but i can just wait nice touch another touch i'm just gonna go for the boost look to the right it comes past a little bit behind me back wait for the bounce play it over one i try it's a good option there the passwords behind me usually you want the pass to be leading you on a bit you want to be a little bit ahead of you you see me messed up a little bit but oh wow that was extremely laggy that's okay give me one for i think it like passed him yeah the ball lagged off of his the back of his car and passed both of us unfortunately makes it a lot easier every time i just go straight back there but at the same time if i waited that guy's flick is not going to be good at all i could have saved it easily so both ways would have worked teammate going straight back and just letting me challenge for him he would have had a free save provided that my teammate challenged for me i would also had a free save that's a good opportunity to cover rotation i don't think my teammate was necessarily a fault there's honestly unfortunate that um there's a little bit of lag on that touch what just happened did i save it did he save it i don't know i don't know what just happened to be honest but i'll take it all right good first game let's get into the next one let's see if we can keep it up and get back to back dubs and get p with the solid 46 points we can all now pretty much guarantee that's probably not garrett g georgie would have at least gotten 48 points there at least minimum we would have to expect that from him but yeah the next game yeah guys we got two's game here we got tricky against sniper matt and sandvik for the last game i'm not gonna cheat on this one let's play a little patient here let's go back wall he's not much of an angle he really messed up and gave himself a lot of uh opportunity on that air dribble to challenge though from him to cut rotation a little bit of a nuisance be fine oh the bump would have been huge there actually been so important would have probably gotten the boost plus the ball had a lot of time to make a play off that but let's play around one i'll tell you about him my teammate nice drop my teammate too ready for that i think it's the best play to make there again if i put that up middle he probably reads it cuts it off and gets to go off of it so best case scenario there just go for a bump leave it for my teammate it's gonna be a free goal again pretty hard situation for my team to end up missing there no i need my flip anymore should be a goal maybe nice i know i flip anymore i would have been a goal but we had beat on the first guy made it really awkward and then me not having my flip also faked that other guy because he thought i had my flip he's trying to block my shot there which never ended up coming through nice good turn actually all done from uh from tricky let's start through this game emilia's trying to block him there and i was trying to rotate behind to get back for worse case scenario because the shot's probably gonna come in pretty quick there gonna be ready for it that's actually a really good try i had i think i had all that block though so even if the shot was perfect like under the bar i probably had it waiting 24 past middle all right well chicky's just going the solo route but he's scoring so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna blame him he's getting goal after goal right now i haven't had to do much better one here off the back wall be good good safe from him try to bump one it's gonna make a little bit harder on their defense to get back actually surprised by the fake there i don't dislike the situation i feel like it was smart because it does end up keeping possession he doesn't throw away his position a left pass would actually be good here but he does seem to like his solo plays and they have been working so i don't blame them how to give myself some more options to deal with this it's a good uh good play you opted for the do nothing with the ball strat and it does work more often than not because when someone has so many options in that spot it really does end up working just a low 50. i'm gonna fake here probably gonna bump another guy i'm gonna attempt she's gonna go all the way back here timmy should go for me i could just try not to get killed but i got killed pretty much all i could do there is just try to avoid the demo in some way but he was hunting me down i'm not gonna go for this no point let me go for this now let's interfere with him i'm gonna fake this keep control play to the left side some space get the boost as well he now pretty much has no play here he just has to hit into me again just in the same situation faking played to open space didn't get the demo my card just is made of rubber but it is okay i played it over one 50 them as well maybe a shot here maybe very hard actually really a pass though gonna have a touch around me i should have cut this off wait for his hit here try to insta challenge off his first touch he might he made a free ball and i bumped the other guy as well second bump would have just been a goal off of that but i still full boost behind you interesting you just played it around me not the best how to play around i feel like you could have had to go out of that if you just played it a little bit differently but that's still working they kept position for a bit off of it i faked this i had a feeling it would work he's going a little bit too fast he's playing a little bit too close to me there so i gave myself a lot of uh options with the fake there makes him look a little bit like silly there like he's not playing it right but he actually was had to hit that properly he would have been following it into the corner and beat me to it i'll try to do something interesting like a little reverse wave dash fake i have a lot of momentum going toward the ball and then as soon as i'm about to hit the ball i just back off last second try to keep this low for 50. i'm gonna kill time for my teammate to get behind me which he is i have to just wait now head over him one more time that could be enough but to make him keep it in maybe might be bad not sure if i can get back i'm gonna instago why not should be fine here play one more my teammate just leave it now pick the mid boost or back boost actually try to go for a bump whoa he hit it a couple too many times but this is the right idea for a pass all right good games for today actually pretty solid stuff i think we're actually getting close to the top 50 part of some of the leaderboards so pretty solid hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself on a date or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe to see us on the next one i love you peace you
