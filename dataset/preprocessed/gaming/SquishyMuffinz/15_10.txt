the other guys so i've been playing a lot with the fennick last few days and i feel like it's better in octane for me right now and i'm looking for something to switch up and feel like really solid on and this the car that's been doing it for me so it's not much different than octane and i've used it before and i've won some turns with energy in the past with it so let's play some games for today gonna be queuing all three modes whatever we get we'll play let's get into it let's see how it goes all right we got two's game off the bat it's pretty hard to game as well yeah riddle isn't too fast it's myself and be you yes goes good test for the first video with the fennec and years let's see how this goes it's a challenge didn't use much boost in that as well which is really good good bump for him you should have this pretty easily oh i messed up but it's okay yeah a lot of time to control that out or go through the corner get like a say 50 on it but you just messed up honestly really really risky like challenge for medals my opinion if b it plays that better it's probably really bad for them but you got to take your risk sometimes especially in twos there we go just read as miss going full speed as like second man and twos when it's not like a for sure thing and is a 50 that could happen like that is usually not the best idea like what happened on their first goal and if it does result in a goal is usually because the mistake beat bull just going to let them hit this it's fine you get their corner as well it's going to create a lot of pressure now because riddles and too fast both went i can't really do much to give for this though but a stall touch if he hits it's going to be bad you should have this should be with the challenge killed one which is good drop from b i'm gonna pass down to him he's gonna have this stay on the wall here it's a good challenge i don't really throw anything at it and we get to touching the ball which we want there can't we do much with this he jumps for this as well i'm blocking him i commit to both of them and bu has free ball now i know 1v1 you messed up already but it's okay if i play behind them both and i did good job at that really well played so far doing what we're supposed to do with the ball like that a little closer to did with there with the fennec is a lot harder for me to do on the octane for some reason just keeping stuff controlled close making sure that first touch is always really good something i can make a play off of it i find it a lot easier to do on the fennec nice force them high off the edge of a bump let's hold them good job so far they can still come back for sure it's a solid uh doer playing i'm gonna wait here i'm gonna let him touch this it's fine if he does i'm gonna do much with it play to myself on the wall i'll be kind of messed up yeah it's okay he's putting himself in like just bad spots to make a play out of stuff okay though uh you could have jumped for it or you could have just happened earlier either would have been good but he hasn't faded in between that that's okay i also also could have played my situation out differently as well so it's not all his fault place off myself here go for a 50 should have that nice the challenge is just gonna pressure this here nobody needs to get touching it it's more just to make them throw it away and i still have all my boosts and resources which is really good whatever's gonna happen out of this oh i did not think there was more that's fine somebody threatening it all not sure if he wants to stay on this or if it's ah i gotta fake really hard byron's not going for it i was good at him to boost today wait for him to flick this beat him would have been a goal but really good block from him good job to match it and play to the left side here i think it's hard for them to do much off of it the left touch touch right playing the touch across into a spot where i can harp them to make a really good hit out of this i think i'd have the advantage in most situations there try to get a controlled hit here good falling off the ceiling now for a while hopefully you can challenge this pass down to him oh i pre-jumped i don't like that but it worked okay i don't like the free jump at all there i feel like you'll get a much more controlled shot much more powerful shot not pre-jumping but good job still did a good job to uh adjust i think the pre-jump is hurting you more than helping you there though ah lucky i want to see what happened oh he just went with the wall backward you might have thought like you might have thought something else was happening out of me going to the corner there but i don't think there's any way i can really get touching the ball it's a good soft touch they can't do anything off but either it's really good nice shot good job for my teammate as well that was a good good time to control take your time rattle's never going to jump for that ball you just in that situation so he's trying to help his teammate so just get the pop out which is the right play for metals but i think his teammate didn't play it too great it's gonna be a goal probably nice i'm gonna play this off to be he could pass back to me oh that's not what i wanted but it's i'll let him hit this i play soft myself and then maybe double really good double wait for the double here how to be you hold on a double from us is perfect got around battles exactly how you wanted should be game all right well done good first game in the fight that's what i mean like i just feel really solid really controlled in the finnick i don't feel like i make any any kind of like like mechanical mistake like everything i want to do with the ball is exactly how it ends up showing on on screen which is perfect like everything i want to do my mind works out so that's how it's supposed to be i think let's get into the next game soon keep it up let's go all right for the last game we got whiz against nexon skills this goes really solid lobbies you're getting today just good everyone's really solid just wait for his touch here there's not gonna be anything good my first touch as well he has no play on this he makes rotating back we can see him so we know we don't panic a little bit unfortunately they're i just would but okay it happens there's no like reason to be urgent there i think that's a big mistake that even people in this rank at the highest rank make is like pointless urgency when you can see everybody you can see where their their players are you know they're not going to be challenging you know they're not going to have any kind of play on it so it's a good challenge for him no real reason to to dive at a ball or force yourself to make a mistake like that when you can see them you know he's not challenging you you know you have time he could have even dribbled it back there but good dribble there to get it back take his time oh yeah flip here play behind him maybe both wet maybe shootable nice touches place off to myself i don't want to bang off the walls and be really easy for the other guy to get touched on that so again here soft touch something that i can still follow up or at least still be relevant in play even if there's a 50 there i'm just trying to make sure i'm still useful in some way let me go straight back here it's pretty big advantage close i try to get soft enough so you can shoot it but it was kind of hard it was good for him to position there i definitely could have passed that like there's a world where i could have passed that perfectly and it's a goal but it's okay it's a good dunk put a bump on wait for him to turn for me okay i'll go for him here fine good cut from skills i'm going to fake jump challenge i notice these guys never they never really fake challenge kind of instagram everything feels like it's very interesting especially in twos you'd think that's a a dangerous way to play but i see it more often than people that fake challenge that was a little play to control there got a nice touch past them i don't think he expected it to go that far ahead of me i'm gonna play for his mid boost here so you have to do all the way back now i know that a little hard to shoot it because the right way position going forward so i'd say it's more my fault it was a good pass and there's a good attempt to try to convert on that that's gonna be a goal probably it's a good bump maybe i don't know i don't know if my team would have been ready to shoot but the guy that took his mid boost back there maybe i show him for a bump as well but it's a very hindsight thing it's possible it could have worked it also possible could have hurt us try to shoot as quick as i could let's still rotate backwards here can we cut it for him probably didn't expect me to be back already which helped a lot there you can drive into this be annoying i'm gonna end up getting bumped here i think okay that was a really bad situation for me i'm trying to bump him i ended up me being in the spot that was more dangerous oh i'm sorry but i thought i should have left it gotta jump for me it's over me it should be perfectly fine he's back oh my back foot that's my vehicle now so awkward a lot of time though man 30. a lot can happen blessing twos i feel like calculus happened just as much in tuesday doing ones like so many little goals that feel avoidable happen ensues you never really feel confident in a lead even like two goal lead with the minute left doesn't even feel good because exactly what just happened can happen easy to just get a quick little solo play goal it's a lot like ones in that way i feel comfortable with like a three goal lead at the minute maybe but just one is never never enough in this i'm gonna follow just to force him to hit it again i'm not gonna turn on that i think he's there first it was okay you almost bumped me that would have been frustrating probably gonna pass but i'm gonna go for his boost here oh it's old oh my god that would be crazy i got the bump on him by accident i think i'll just shut up our goal that'd be a good situation to flip yeah i got it let's get saved you have to just completely guess there didn't have it i don't have any boost here hopefully they don't hit some peak shot oh keep it up 1v1 no boost i like the idea to pass that i don't have anything still just got to try though it could just be a goal let me go for the midbeast here we get one more play maybe i finally get a moose in the ball this dies completely oh you got the boost it's actually huge past the wall should just be eagle yes you pass that's really fast to look for those are the passes that always are deadly because it's gonna be a last guy back in a situation where you have to cover so many options you can even have to worry about like the back wall touch the pass back like there's so many things you can do there that's really a pass to make yeah it's gonna be off this thing i hope you enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time is thanks for watching this like comment subscribe this is on the next one logo peace you
