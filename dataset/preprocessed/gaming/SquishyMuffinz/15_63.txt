yo what's up guys i decided to do some more hoops games for today i've actually been craving this game but i'm not gonna lie so let's play some hoops games have some fun we'll see how it goes all right we got y2 speedy and shockward against me and hoops nerd all right hopefully hoops nerd is crazy i need all the help i can get oh my play this oh fake i was gonna hit it off the the rim to myself but that guy's coming for the block really quick so i didn't want to just hit it into him awkward touch for me but it should be able to get there she's gonna wait for my teammates touch one more hit here i try to time the pinch just right it couldn't quite oh my it's actually close my hoops nerd might be crazy but i saw one of them going i didn't need to rush that so hard all right i should have won't be one here trying to play it over him oh i couldn't land though i want to do something like weirder with that touch back there but i couldn't quite the conversion though i thought the air dribble looks so weak i was going to try to get around the ball jump to the backboard and try something but i couldn't quite [Music] nice double tap though you can always rely on those in this mode you never quite get used to seeing people say stuff like that always feels weird [Music] everyone is really kind kinder than you'd expect [Music] like you grow up like well for me at least i grew up in games where like everyone was really toxic all the time and this game i feel like i guess i'm sure people are still talking to broccoli but probably more because a lot of people know me in this game it's only really kind people i run into it's like a double though a bit of a different one like a pre-flip into a double got you shockward nice just a bunch of double tap you have so much room to work with in this mode i really like it for that reason so much you can do and the ball has to be high to go in so you have to have pretty good aerial ability i should have went i think that's my ball to go for it's fine though put around them trying to beat him to it i can't actually shoot off of that but it's more about just hitting around him nice good read from him i should have been a little bit closer that's my problem there hard to actually get a hit on that where i was from try to bump over just be annoying nice play it around him again you see me do that a lot see the left or right of the field actually make that play around someone i tried to snipe it off the walls close that's my teammate did just enough work oops nerd go good read chocolate isn't good he's meeting me at the perfect spot on the double really good job to get to that point one touch oh trying to tip it up off the bounce really good demo i'm really i don't know why i'm like super scared of the batmobile clicks all the time when i see someone about to start a batmobile flick i like get really scared good job my teammate i flashbacks of 2016 2017 cooks here [Music] [Music] i played around them hope this boost comes back i'm just gonna wait for it i think it's worth it my team might have got it actually he didn't there's a chance my team went by he got it there god that wasn't the case huge read don't go in okay we're good it looks sketch wait this is crazy no i don't think that was horrible i don't know why i even tried this for it i was so used to oh my teammates crazy [Music] that's a good bump for the bounce maybe i could double this up the corner no i never wait long enough you have to wait like the corner doubles like the key to the corner double is that you just wait a little bit longer than you think my teammate really is a hoops nerd he's crazy yeah if you take a second like as soon as you make the first touch off of a corner for a corner double you just take an extra second normally it'll give you time to read it it's only all you need but this mode is a little bit different the corner bounces work a little bit different so you can't just do the same thing you would in a normal game but the same idea definitely applies close let him have it i think it's worth i'm gonna fake this sorry you guys heard this team messages sorry about that all right good first match though let's get the next one it was fun let's even get back back dubbed on the day hopefully we get hoops nerd again so we can have another really really solid teammate let's get into it all right we got five up and leicester please it's a netty i recognize the netty i think unless i'm confusing him with someone else wait that was crazy lester please am i live represent any flippy set ah couldn't quite get it past them i think we're starting to get into the wait this is crazy oh my gosh i didn't say i think we're starting to get into like the higher ranked people these guys are actually really solid i could touch you know we present any air dribble for some reason that messes me up more than if someone goes for like a perfect air dribble what do you just did right there you just boomed it so much harder to read that for some reason than what you'd expect just like the basic air dribble ah not quite enough nice touch off the corner should be really hard for him actually nice [Music] let's go quick here maybe a double let's be sick oh i'm not good at doing those like super fast like close to the wall doubles most of the time it feels like it's a little bit luck based if you do get it right gotta bump them of course i hit the lip huge 50. i place a shot yeah it's got to be hard for them yeah okay i was gonna say there's no way to get there go one more maybe ah not quite enough sauce on that my teammate's crazy dude it's so hard to read the bounces in this this mode every time it bounces off the the rim like that it's so hard five up shooting his shot oh he wants he's trying to to get the key right now all right well i actually can't do more for today i'm actually really short on time that's gonna be all for today guys i hope you enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night but every time you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace is
