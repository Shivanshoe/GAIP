Yodas up guys playing some more games today with really we're almost up the top 10 on the leaderboards if we get 2300 that's around top 5 so that's pretty announcer actually get really close 2,300 yeah I see chained to the game today save me some good ones let's get into it let's see how it goes all right for the first year playing is alpha cap and Young Evo funny story I actually met really and alpha cap together playing against them at 2 v 2 Lane Universal open season to us the land I ended up winning with gimmick and we played these guys in the qualifier the first LAN that was in Chicago that was a way back alpha cap wasn't me at all arrests yet now he's an RS really has a major asset but he's always been good he's always had that potential I think at least I was just funnier playing his original do a partner there we go how's he a play over Kip and then I good good double to finish it off he's got used to put together all the time got his boost he's gonna try to stay with that which is fine clean oh he has none there's gonna be a forced play if anything I always a lot my baby I didn't need to should be a go off the read though here we go also huge thank you to all the support on the channel guys you guys are incredible R up to around 825 case and like that it's kind of nice to think about we're less than 200 K away from 1 mil now it's just absolutely ridiculous I was really in shock from kept to delay their awkward position to be in for me but very good shock for him but yeah less than 200 K any from 1 million sub that's kind of crazy to think about and I will be doing a controller giveaway soon for a head okay there's a little bit later than usual but it will be coming I promise and then we'll be doing one for 900 K and a million as well oh my yeah everything we're doing is perfect this game he said Bray but he typed it wrong and just boosts nice gonna have that over me such fun to kind of fake them with the single jumps here that's fun we've 70 boost I'll just go defend maybe I couldn't really reach her that's fine nice your job to control that up the field day might have had a shot or that but all the touch the skimmer alright I'll pick up the choice really good for him I got to be careful of this so he's gonna try to bought me Anderson it go might as well go better than getting bumped and waiting being too passive there you gotta try to look at the danger in a situation like that there we go I was really good from really I think you forced out the ball there gave me a really good opportunity to score it oh my god how about the score baby off the wall they're actually kind of worked I hid around them there we go I was a good 50s and you come back middle he's gonna get the boost probably I'll just stay to be annoying I don't really need to do anything too crazy they're members trying to get it over one guy go back it's a good bait from really the Gators didn't go for the ball at all he didn't even flip into the ball whatsoever they just drove around it and he got me a free ball I was really smart how do dogs happen I don't know that was a weird the sequence I got bumped literally a fate that's tough he just looked the wrong way you look the other way able to cover the fake in the shot I just really awkward though I don't blame him for getting fake but I was really weird situation nice from kept their follow that up past a really good try the bump it actually really smart you can get the shots here for the bump have you liked that idea a lot oh my touch try to follow this off the wall she'll be able to get this I love some boots as well get a boomer try to make it as awkward as possible these high hits still very useful got to be really careful here I'm let me go first taking beta touches perfect oh no that's my bad I bumped into I was I was a little bit confused on the bait there I thought it's gonna like dive into it that kind of sucks I was gonna have a shot probably on the challenge right there just driving into my teammate it's all good that happens you're trying the shot really good save kept playing pretty solid this game I'm gonna try to go from the low angle so good though I let him go yeah a feeling that can come back it's one of those games ever never felt fully in control of we got a good girl chef the bet yeah for those flip free sets you really just have to like you already see that that perfect that like high level like really high oh well that's the beautiful preset and you just did that so yeah goes to show it goes to show doesn't really matter if you notice it still make big mistakes like that the only way to defend that kind of thing is just to have someone block hi someone block alone if he was just blocking alone waiting on the goal line there they're free cleared through corner and that guy would have been stuck in our net then we don't want me to situation for us I should have been good for us that you went for that but it's hard to know that and you know it's a simple mistake I'm not blaming or anything it happens but it's definitely definitely defendable it's not an undefendable shot anyway let's get the next game Steven keep it up it's really good first game from us and yeah really well played from offcuts get the next one all right philosophy of playing against Landon and six I might call you calm six go sue me that's what it is how you say it he's good block gonna hit it over both keep fresh a close try on the double I wanted to bump him or something help really it all there I left the boost there and you went for the ball at least one of us going for the ball and another get good fish so win-win keeps pressure again too nice you're gonna have that good block I respect your lens on the energy decal I respect it so I like to see the old one though the og one I do think I like that would you want a little bit more than a new one but they're both nice suppose clean oh my god focus I was playing with him you it was calling me a boy before cuz I you ask me what games I play and I said Cisco and Valerie call me a boy for a reason rude oh honey no is everything I know that offensive I don't know what defense of these days Oh get destroyed Italy food dance to control over round one for nothing and the flick I don't know if he's talking to me for the sign maybe maybe he wants really signs I don't really want to say no problem because then it seems like I'm assuming it's toward me so I only really reply if they say my name but I normally sign anyway [Music] almost a speed that needed good challenge you're really a challenge from what a shop oh no [ __ ] wet got the mid view so it's just good trying to make a panicky I could still get the speech maybe I couldn't if I got that boost I was huge massive so I kind of been baited in I had a free pass but a really they play left side yeah this guy bumped me off the boost is a boost Magnum I ran out of babysitting we're just good effect [ __ ] ego I believe Bank nice shot but it's tough to read sometimes you're not ready for the bounce up we'll try to dump them good touch you don't even even try to shoot that it's good that he didn't try to do honesty's sometimes worse to shoot those let's just hit it around oh by the flip that's the order to play there is a double commit there we go I should be able to get this guy might even be a goal unless I miss X it also really as it never minds we both suck I shoulda scored for sure let's fake I get the beasts big good boy everyone's so good on defense now it's crazy I'm bumping I'm a bumper tell me for the the shot here the patience pays off boom boom that's guys wrong I couldn't lay just walked it in we're gonna go for like a weird mini double tap we kids go ahead Oh and such and we could've definitely like three more goals but it's fine having fun with it oh my god these guys are nuts on defense all of a sudden all right guys for one morning no man I can't my name too far off at the flip maybe one more no all right he so it's fun you've really missed a bunch ethnicity in there hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful date or night with Alzheimer's and you're
