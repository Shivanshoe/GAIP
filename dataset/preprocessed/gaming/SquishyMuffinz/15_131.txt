challenge he goes for goes straight into my net happens definitely happens try to get control of the ball off cuffs though it's going to be the biggest thing big touch to the side here it gives yourself a lot of options i'm going to swing into this ball go for a normal shot doesn't look like anything crazy right but that's one of the hardest shots to stop from that range it's very difficult to react in time even if you're a very good player and all i'm doing is driving into that ball it's a shot that any of you guys watching this can do extremely effective all right so we're gonna early challenge a lot so we're gonna take advantage when we see him doing that if we have full control of the ball get a little bit above the 50. it's gonna be a very good situation for us because we stay grounded they go high it can react to whatever happens next our kickoff's actually been doing really well here can't get too aggressive on this but i know you wasted about 30 boosts already there's no flip here so i could just stay near the ball it's a good challenge it's a bit of score off that a really good job to stay close there and keep track of the amount of boost that he used obviously there's no threat there because i knew he didn't have his flip anymore the biggest thing that makes that threatening is when they have their flip and they're close enough to the ball to flip it over your last second that's what makes the situation's very very dangerous let's play it across here we still have the boost control in a situation so we play this out to the right side here swing and have a lot of options again look how simple we're playing out all these situations they might have a lot of pressure out of all of these i think it's a good player as well right are you left for the boost so that's interesting play there didn't think you'd do that my bum bus it's fine i get to back so i can get the pads have about 60 boost should i just be annoying here that's all boomer flick what the heck that's just into he's definitely just trying to flick that over me i don't know how i went so hard though that was crazy for just up front flip flick i think it was a lower flick i might have had contact on it but i don't know how you can possibly react to look like that like a basketball to the side here again give myself a look at all the options i have here right and if it goes fast it's fine i'm gonna keep on challenging so he still does the early challenges that's what he's trying to do on on defense a little bit unfortunate honestly bumped him up the wall into a really good position to just go back down and shoot kind of lucky probably should have killed him i don't know how i didn't kill him to be honest sometimes you gotta chalk it up to something a little bit unfortunate there we go the chasing of the demo there take some soft touch to myself here at abandonment we know what he likes to do honest challenges who should come back here kill would have been huge my car is made of rubber at the moment it doesn't have a lot of boosts already here i stay on this ball take the high shot get back around let's take another shot here there we go it doesn't have to be anything too crazy because we know if we waste all our boosts here that's what he wants right he wants to go for something very risky something that wastes all of our boost he's gonna be able to get a situation easier simpler thing in that position is almost always better very aggressive very aggressive challenges did it really work as well as it's working but it is i don't think he's complaining very all in right if i thought i crossed there he dove all the way in for that ball on no boost but he's taking risks i mean and ranked a lot of times really is nothing to lose so i don't blame you if you lose what you really lose right just some virtual points no one really cares a lot of the time but yeah people playing a little bit unrealistic you say from us i don't watch the demo here it's far away so we have a little time there we go so again very very aggressive challenge i knew he turned because he's been doing that every single time it's just a little bit too risky when you're going all in every single time you gotta switch it up sometimes right it's worked a lot for him this game to be honest he's gotten three goals off shoot up challenges as well played for him but you definitely gotta switch it up at some point and it only works so much right so this is like a series for example instead of just one game i definitely have so much time to adapt to how he's playing and adjust right this being the first time i've ever played this guy in 1v1 but i know he's a once player it's a new experience right i have to adapt as the game goes on but if this is a series i'd be able to adapt to the fast challenges and probably have a much easier time in the upcoming games even though he's a very good player just a playstyle that's easy to adapt to i think take my time to see my boost here last i can go for a fast shot there we go and we land with 40 boost in a very good position to recover get his corner boost maybe turn around and get another shot keep up the the sequence i always try to save your boost in those positions in 1v1 even 3v3 it's very good because you could turn around and stay in the play probably got an early challenge again here i'll just flick over him soon he does pop this one on goal he's gonna have to panic a little bit here i'm gonna fake jump i'm gonna be above his head he's gonna panic there it is so from his pov i can show you guys in a replay after for example but he'll probably bulk him on here here's me jump he's going to panic right away like he did hit it away give me a free goal you guys try to imagine yourself in the opponent's shoe sometimes in those situations what are they seeing if they have ball cam on the balls above them are behind them they probably don't see you at all so you can utilize that fake jump to your advantage those are the best situations to do that go back for the boost here i'm going to fake challenge early at midfield and hopefully this works i go again there we go i made him do a little cut to the side that also cut down his options very heavily i never wasted my positioning because i just fake challenge good vehicle good recovery there we got bumped a little bit to the ceiling we got back down that's gonna be the first game done while playing room you didn't play bad you're just playing very aggressively and it's gonna come down to you have to win every single challenge if you're playing like that right if you're not switching it up at all and you're playing all pure aggression you got to win your challenge perfectly and he was doing that for the first half of the game but it's very hard to consistently do that the whole game right yeah let's keep it up let's even get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right playing aegis this time it's another good player that i recognize i'm gonna try to figure out off the bat maybe you won't expect it people normally don't expect the first one but now that i did it off the very first kick off he's probably gonna expect everyone after this but try to get a grasp on how he wants to play this so he's playing already very aggressive challenge off the bat here probably something we can expect this whole game fight to guess you can tell a lot within the first like 10 seconds of how someone wants to play to be honest if you play close enough attention you can figure out a lot about a player off the first 10 seconds look at this boost here that's huge can we back up again it's a little bit too risky it's better to shadow that because you have to throw it away eventually i actually have been on target it feels a little more power on that any power shot from midfield here i'll just give it away cost a little bit too high there go back to the mid boost probably better all you can do is get onto the ground with this so it's not much of a threat yet here we go got the ball off of them bumped them off got full boost here fun another very aggressive challenge so we played two very aggressive players here back to back can't shoot off that i know that cause i bumped them we gotta try to flick a little bit earlier i think when you're playing someone aggressive like this put them in a weird spot so they're not comfortable in try to say grounded as much as you can too because they're probably the same players like to go for a lot of bumps so gotta stay in a good spot to be ready for that that's very very unfortunate you got the perfect perfect ground pinch very unfortunate normal shot there would have been fine somehow hit the ball off the bounce and got a pinch out of it live unlucky probably he himself probably wasn't even going for a pinch like that take time here look at that turn and instachallenge can definitely be a bad thing but a lot of these players are doing that in ones right now in na at least i don't know how eu plays it out but it's very um very interesting it's quite risky like that again another example of how that can be bad you're diving all in on a very very risky ball and they're trying to do it so that doesn't give me space because obviously you know that if i have space with the ball i can do good things with it but at the same time there's so much risk involved in all these challenges and it's only going to work so much right you could definitely win a game off of this the way they're playing it but there's that risk aspect to it that'll always be there ended up missing by a little bit as a tough shot to get around there too fair and get power on it fake here let him hit that on the wall again you can panic he's gonna go again here now it's gonna be my ball gotta be careful gonna go for a bump probably in a situation so i just hit up the wall i bumped a little bit i don't know how we got the boost off him so it's okay get dunked from us probably falling pretty far here but i can't go for a shut up shot unfortunately because a little bit awkward you have to wait swing wide get the boost take a better angle on it yeah we got to be careful though because i don't like these matchups to make me a little bit uncomfortable at first and i'm not too uh used to being like into the challenge like this all the time it's very weird when i like scrimp frozen ones i don't really scream pros often ones but when i play pros and ones just for fun for example no one ever really plays like this is very uh very different than what i'm used to so something you definitely have to adjust to and it does not come easy very tough thing to adjust to the very aggressive play style ones let him touch it and see if he does give us the ball back here still being played into us very good 50 from us gonna touch that now take a good shot on that there we go i'll put on the 50s a way to play the situation out really well already come out on top with an empty net on us so it's well played go to the ceiling here let's thread our flip the whole way down but not actually use it to the cb panics very well played very patiently played for him i still have a full boost in a pretty good spot here there saving my boost here i touch it one more time get this boost now clear up the wall take a shot if he gets back to it we can go again play to the mid boost here down to myself go for another shot to play defense here for a little bit i was a good follow-up recovery it might actually be a girlfriend i don't think i can get back gotta play some defense he's going to the wall i'm gonna fake challenge off the ceiling and then go back to the backboard let him flip now all right he picked up a little bit too early i made it obvious good kill from him might actually be a goal i don't know if i can get back in time he missed the boost so we're good for a second i'm gonna pre-jump this actually i'll go back down it's too far he has to use this flip here should be fine go for a lot of these ceiling pinches ground pinches off ceiling shots i should say two goal lead here gotta play for time so i'm just gonna stay in front of the ball block any angle he has on goal and there we go fake the big hit here get him off the ball fake jump there we go all right solid games today we play two very aggressive players two players that are very tough to play against and ones if you're not prepared to try to adapt to it but very fun games all around probably play the last two one of my placements in the next video yeah
