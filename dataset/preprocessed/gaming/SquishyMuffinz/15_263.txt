Yodas uh guys haven't made a video like this in a long time so I decided why not make a brand-new up-to-date video so that every time you guys have this question you can come back to this video and it's my most recent settings and I haven't really been changing a whole lot so what you see is we're probably gonna be using for a while so we're gonna get into the settings in a second before we do I just wanted to say thank you so much to all the support on the channel we're nearing 800 K we're super super close man we're getting closer and closer to every single day thank you so much making that a possibility if you do enjoy my content and you would like to help me along my road to 1 million subscribers make sure you do hit that subscribe button and make sure you hit the bell as well star is notified when I upload a brand new video thank you so much again for all the support I love you guys let's head into the settings so I changed a couple things recently and you guys probably noticed it off the bat that my boost meter is smaller than usual I'll tell you guys how to change that in a sec but we'll start off with the first tab so for a gameplay it's up to you guys really if you want to use unlimited boost in free play you don't need to you could turn it off and it might get you you know some practice with boost management if I have like 60 boost here I know what I can do with 60 boost because I'm practicing with you know my my boost actually being limited so that's something you can mess with and try to figure out if you want to use you know unlimited boost all the time or have a limited so you know your boost usage and how much boost you're actually using and maybe even learning the padding of where the pads are at that's two useful things that you can get out of not using on the mid abuse that's probably the biggest thing to be honest on this first page everything else is pretty much default it's up to you guys if you want text chat disabled some people do voice chat I disable that cuz I don't people yelling in the mic when I'm playing especially when I'm streaming split screen layout I don't think it really matters cross-platform I turn it on because I don't mind playing against ps4 and Xbox players up to you guys if you're on ps4 you don't wanna play PC players you could turn that off if you want only constant players in your games all the stuff I think should be default I'm not on visit sure about the input buffer or the bandwidth limit I'm pretty sure that you could change two of these settings if you're having internet issues if you change it to something you can actually help with that by changing those settings I'm not sure exactly what they are but you can so look into that more if you're having internet issues maybe that might help you show competitor divisions I have that on and extra mode ranks have that on and game status play level you could change this to whatever you want but have them main stats only because I don't want all stats popping up so anyway for camera this is the big one that always gets asked in my streams on my YouTube comments everywhere pretty much and I do change these pretty often but I've been on these for probably a week and a half now and we just won our first tournament under energy together with these settings so if you guys are wondering what they are here it is it's 110 270 110 negative three is zero point four four point seven twelve SP which is just only affecting how fast the camera moves left to right with your right stick and transition speed which is how fast your camera snaps on and off the ball on ball cam so those are my camera settings and what I will say for you guys that are wondering what settings to use or you try these settings you don't like them there's a pretty obvious range of what settings are used in Pro play so I'll just give you guys that range right now and from my experience I've used so many different variations of camera settings this is what I would experiment if I was you guys for the first time trying out new settings or you're just stuck you don't know what's you so fulfilled of you try anywhere between I'd say 108 to 110 that's what's used in Pro play most people use 110 distance I would say anywhere between 260 and 290 that's most of what to use in Pro play the average right now I'd say what most pros are using is 270 for height most people you'll see them using 90 to 110 most people right now I'd say use a hundred that's probably the most used one at the moment but either 110 or 90 is useful I use 110 negative three right now but there's different combinations of height and angle that go over the well together I'll tell you guys those combinations in a second so yeah big gap for angle is negative 3 to negative 5 and this one is probably the one that there is no set number pros use like literally any of these 3 there's no one that's use the most I'd say if I had to guess negative 3 is probably used the most right now I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but it's between negative 5 and negative 3 is let's use no one really uses 2 or 6 no one really uses be on there for stiffness you can really use anywhere between 0 and 1 but I'd recommend you guys to only use between 30 and 70 that's probably the sweet spot most pros use point 4 I would say point 4 is probably the most popular stiffness just because it's a good amount of like Wiggly and when you turn it feels fast I don't know it's a good amount of like just feeling fast and it feels Wiggly and it feels loose and it doesn't feel like you're too stuck to your car and you'll notice right away if you try 70 stiffness for example you'll notice the difference and you got to figure out if you like how it feels because you know some people do like outfields there's some really good players that use high stiffness and you know they're very successful with it so you just got to find out what you like to use the most that's all so for stiffness yet anywhere between 40 and 70 is what I recommend but I'm using 40 right now and most pros do use 44 swivel speed about 4.7 but honestly it doesn't matter at all what use for this it's all up to if you want your camera to be super snappy when you're looking right and left or if you want it to be like super slow so it's a slow gradual movement when you're moving right and left like this it's completely up to you just gotta find a middle ground I think 4.7 it's a good mid where I can do a slim just if I need to back wants to do a quick one if I want to so I think it's a good middle ground my opinion and again for the lasting transition speed this is completely preference I just don't like to at all snapping completely on and off the ball like this right away is it's not what I want to see at all it just hurts my head every time that little now the cut in the and the camera I don't like that at all so I like to have mine at one point too that way it's smooth and it's fast at the same time that's a good good in-between for me I'll give you guys some combinations to work with over my time of experimenting with settings you should use a base of 110 to 70 and they messed with 110 negative 3 100 negative 390 negative 5 100 negative 5 100 negative 4 and yeah that's pretty much the main ones that most people use some people use 100 negative 3 but those are the main combinations of height and angle yeah with all those ranges that I gave you guys you should be able to pick some settings that you do end up enjoying but these are pretty much where most pros are looking at right now in terms of settings it's somewhat near this for controls all I use that's different than the normal default controls is power slide on l1 and my arrow is also on l1 and I have my air roll right on square for you know air dribbles and for other things in the air it's just a different way of air rolling that you have a little bit more control over your car for to have that on square and then I just moved my scoreboard to r1 because I moved my air roll and stuff to l1 so I had to move that over to r1 that's it that's only thing on my controls that are changed so let's go back real quick and here we have our steering and cents at 1.3 this is purely personal preference and a lot of pros changes quite often I'd say the average is definitely 1.3 though for most pros dodge deadzone is really up to you if you have a too low you're gonna backflip so you want to have it a decent number where you're not gonna backflip it's all preference like I said because it depends how much you pull your stick down if you pull your sink down a lot you don't really need it that high you can have your much lower but yeah I like mine at 0.7 just to prevent back flipping and I think it's a good in-between and control dead zone I like mine at 0.05 this is definitely where most pros use see their 0.05 or 0.1 is what you'll see out of most pros but the majority user was certified by far margin but 1.3 1.3 is definitely what you want to look for in terms of a good baseline for sensitivities it's almost produced for interface I'm using 87 95 100 so 87 interface skill and the 95 display scale is what moves my boost from being you know as big as it normally is which is this to down to where it was so 87 and 95 is what I'm using right now that's why my boost is smaller and I honestly wanted to try to do this and get used to this so that I have more awareness of the field and I feel like in a way it kind of makes me play a little bit smarter because I feel like I could see more of the field that I make better decisions because I have more time to tell what's gonna happen there's not much my screen being covered by anything for a nameplate omona have been on default that's what you want to have it on that's so that you always see everyone's name play at all times it doesn't just disappear when they go far away you want to have that unfold that's the best setting to have for that matter certifications I have it on time updates only I don't like things popping up in the middle of my screen I like to only see the time updates I have this on color by mode off you can use it on if you want if your club out of course you should use this but you know some people using I'm not even colorblind they just like the way the colors look so you can you can mess it up if you wanted to force default team colors I don't have that on rocket IDs I have on notifications on team color boost meaner again up to you personal preference if you want a blue or orange you know it's up to you really if just make that choice for yourself metric and I have on ball communicator I have off that's if you want the red thing on the bottom left I don't really like it on so probably gonna turn it off ya know I'll leave it on you know I'll leave it I'm sure I'll make a change with that and Bolero I have on that's only if you want to have that little white arrow above your car if you don't want it turn it off I like to have it on because if I have all came off and the balls above my head I want to be able to see where it is quick I think it's a really really useful thing to have to be honest for video settings almost every single pro uses the same thing the only thing you'll see maybe different is will detail like high quality that's about the only difference you'll see out of some pros but this is what you want to be using the default resolution obviously some people use stretch actually I've seen some like freestylers you stretch I haven't seen any pros use it but use default res I think it's the best bet anti-aliasing off and you want to have all of these off except for transparent goal posts and then world detail is the one that I was talking about you want to have all these at low I'd say but if you want to have multiple ball shells behind the ball put it on high quality world detail it shows multiple ball trails when I turn that off and hit the ball oh just have one line only one line so if you want the multiple trails then use it on high quality but it's completely up to you really it's all preference in terms of that but that's what most pros use everything off and then maybe some probes use high quality for audio I have it on this but it's different for everyone it depends on your PC or your piece for your xbox and for chat I really changed much here but that's that yeah guys those are all my settings and I wanted to make this video just because like I said a lot of you guys always ask me stuff of how many settings in I figured when I give you guys just a baseline video that you can always come back to that has everything you know you need right here right here in one video that way you don't have to keep asking the question and it's all your fingertips whenever you want if you ever forget what settings I was using come back here and yes my camera settings will change a little bit here and there but that range that I gave you for every single setting is always what I'm pretty much using so just try to find a camera setting in between those ranges and you'll be good to go honestly you'll find settings that you feel comfortable with and honestly you might even better off finding your own settings rather than using mine enjoy him end of the day a lot of settings are just personal preference you just got to take your time and find him same thing that comes with any FPS if you're trying to find your sensitivity or your crosshair it's all mostly preference so don't copy a pro stuff just because you know they're Pro it's not gonna instantly make you a pro you gotta find what feels good to you anyway guys I hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night River time is when you're watchin is like comment subscribe and I see you guys all in the next one I love y'all and peace
