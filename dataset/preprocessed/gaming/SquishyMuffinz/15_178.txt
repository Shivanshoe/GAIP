yo what's up guys gonna be playing some twos with garrett for today should be some good ones we're almost a super sonic legend let's get into it see if we can get some dubs and see if we can get one step closer to supersonic ledge all right we got an extremely sweaty game for the first match up here playing daniel and ajax this map by the way it's so hard for me to read the the walls i don't know if you guys agree with me on that but i find it so hard to read the walls on this map if i wasn't getting chase was a very stable shot but it was a good shot regardless i think i played that pretty well in terms of trying to avoid him it's just i don't know you have to kind of hope that you get lucky in a way with the shot being a little bit lackluster good shot nice good job well done well done got it back now when someone's bumping like that you got to be creative in terms of how you get out of it especially if there's a shot coming in behind it as well makes it that much harder it's a decent touch i don't have any boost there so i feel like booming it's probably the better idea of the better place to make there there loves the pre-jump it feels like ended up beating him which is good should have passed the gear it would have been better didn't realize i had the option until it was too late very weird play but might actually still work somehow some way two's effect the ranked effect the weirder the play the more likely it works and garrett's just absolutely a legend he's crazy very good floaty air dribble those are really good because make your opponent think you're out of boost and then when they least expect it you just pop one more over their head back a little boost here in awkward situation i'm gonna let him just flip this away good take from garrett i'm still kind of low boost here in an awkward spot but let's see what he does here actually ended up reading it well done from him a super awkward scenario to be in so well played should i go figure it here let's help him out oh my bad i didn't put him in the best spot i thought maybe he'd be okay but i think he just didn't land how he wanted to he also might have they're going for another spanish giraffe here very interesting place it's actually going to work potentially it's going to boom that one all you can do is boom this back it's the only option he has so it gives it right to get really good play from us good try the challenges try to get the boost here i couldn't get it gonna be garrett's ball to bang i like the low shot attempt there's actually very smart oh i shouldn't have went for that didn't realize he was going for another 50 should actually work out pretty well unless girl gets dunked too that is a very awkward spot to spawn into i'm not gonna lie i hate spawning like that that close to where everything's going down ah good try good air dribble i was in a bad spot there played around one the back wall there we go let's play from gear to be there well done got the lead back two minutes left very sweaty lobby like i said don't expect anything less than an overtime here to be honest daniel's a very good uh he's like 13 year old the prodigies nice from garrett to cut that off that's huge because i could have been a really good shot for me jax you never know trying to play this into a corner where you can't really make a good play out of this can't wait to do much to help i can't realize that so it went for me nice they know these pre jumps man gotta run out of boost pretty soon here as soon as he does i just go for the block there we go i also allowed garrett to get back which is a win-win situation and garrosh is converting on every single opportunity so we'll take it plain solid filling in the gaps gary's just banging them home all you can ask for they're going for a spanish every single time they're not even queued up together as well that place hit a wall an awkward spot go for a quick shot close got the mid-right boost here it might actually be straight in yeah it is it's a good shot from ajax i think there's a a pinch it's well done hard to save hard for gear to read that obviously because that that could also just stick straight to the wall right it's such a hard thing to read danish had to go for one two looked over one he messed it up it's gonna be free go forget it can't get back to that it's a very tough spot to be in took my time there instead of just booming it ended up paying off got over ajax and when you challenge that close to the net like that like ajax did it leaves that last guy back in a very vulnerable position if you don't get a good challenge on it right play it back to garrett give him a lot of space on the wall here a lot of options to work with that's a bad bad pass from me didn't really give garrett that many options i tried to fake the big shot like a really fast shot and then passed down that didn't work out how i wanted it to [Music] good play though got three goal lead 30 seconds left should be should be a win here unless we choke but they're doing this kickoff over and over again wait we did the counter oh he's gonna have a double here to the side oh he just doubled into his own neck already they're gonna forfeit off that i assume they don't okay they're gonna go for the same kickoff again i'm gonna try to fake this one oh they're not they're not actually you could tell if the bad guy stays in gold they're doing something weird most of the time so one way to tell oh they would have shot well done garrett's farming right now yeah this is gonna be a really sweaty game and then we kind of just pulled away with the lead but it's looking uh looking good for this video hopefully we can get ourselves i should have came to him for the pinch hopefully we can get ourselves um another win here and get that much closer to supersonic legend because i'm pretty sure both the dudes who just played are really high up let's see they're both grand champ three okay i'm gonna queue again let's get into the next one i'm running top hundred oh yeah ajax is 40th right now ajax is 40th and daniel's top 30 as well so it's a very sweaty game we got milt and dries here okay i think it's like you say his name or drey's i'm not sure but i call him dries i like the way it sounds my fake going off the ceiling here trying to make him panic i got bumps should be garrett's ball now some may get bumped that's better just to leave it at that point pre-jump that's a good picture from him i can go for a shot here potentially i place that perfectly it's a goal but it's a little bit uh what's the word expecting too much potentially play it off the back wall close the bottom like it doesn't go post the post good 50 from us take some pads here try to stay relevant middle give him an option if he wants to use it garrett should win that boost battle good follow-up from garrett he's gonna be there for this so gotta play in a way that i don't get beat and the gear in a bad spot there we go good play again if i lose that back to garrett that's actually better that's really what we want in a situation we don't even want to win that challenge we don't gain much from winning that challenge kind of just gives the opponent the ball yeah both these guys are once players though so they're playing in a very like aggressive way so most of the time when people are playing super aggressive like that counters are what you're gonna score on the most and although it can be boring it's definitely just the best possible way to play against it try to bump them forget can't do much about that couldn't really challenge because he could have had an air dribble bump right that's the thing he has to worry about there air dribble bumps to automatic goal in a situation so in my head i'm trying to help gear anyway i can i'm going for that ball whatever it may be as long as it's at least somewhat helpful that's all i'm looking for there through where the ball should be forget wait for the shot and this is what we can counter on potentially toss this high forward is going to be awkward for him good control though wait for garrett to go for this should have one more time maybe another good box we're getting like very last-second blocks here and it's helping them a lot in these situations it's alone for a while just coming time garrett knows that play the 50 well faked one got his boost made him jump as well which forces the ball out should be garrett's ball to go for let him shoot that it's fine honestly give garrett a free save you know for a lot of bumps like on the way back they're trying to bump a lot but somebody doing a lot it's just making it annoying to make a play down field right uh i somehow got bumped off the air dribble bump pop that up there good pop from garrett again he actually hasn't shot potentially it's gonna fake tried to get another good 50. would have been actually a really good play potentially even a goal not a bad idea from us launch that a little bit too hard but it's fine gerry could turn again makes it awkward for the opponent decent try from us try to play to the right side again tried to get a bump actually been perfect we got the boost it's fine next best thing gonna be garrett's ball again we still have pressure i'd say they're playing on the reaction good kill on one of them it's going to give us a lot of time in this corner unfortunate that he's spawned there to be honest but see garrett can do you miss a touch it makes him have to back off but he has a good counter counter back should be fun i'll play this to the wall try to shoot double commit is good for us there they're playing just full defense now it feels like so we're gonna have to score off like a passing player something pretty much the only thing that can get through when teams are playing this defensive just pre-jumped that it's fine this is really good for us now didn't panic though just get on him keep this in one more time and they're just playing full on defense so it just comes down to pinpointing one mistake and getting a go out of it that might be the mistake we needed very awkward spot from the being and is the mistake we needed there we go when you're just playing someone that's playing full defense they're trying to win off a one goal lead for the entire game that's a tough thing to do very tough thing to do so i feel like it's almost better to keep offensive pressure than have to be stuck on defense but i guess it's all preference in that situation it couldn't be super close for that obviously it's a little bit risky to be that close something goes wrong and not a good position to get back leave this boost for you good save from gay all done good follow it does take two sometimes to deal with those air dribbles because you never know if they're going to have another touch over you you want to have someone behind you just in case like absolutely worst case scenario you want to have someone there so i'm trying to kill time for gear to get behind there you race the second jump i know that he has to throw it away so now it's going to be gears ball good beat as soon as you see someone use their second jump in a spot like that that's when you know you have to strike and make them do something else close good try in the shot killed one which is good gonna leave him in a 1v1 here not quite in but it's fine i can keep this in and get the boost as well win-win try to go for a bump here i think it'll be best case scenario i can turn again it's fine good job from garrett stay right wall surprise this is the sweatier game of the two considering we were playing but yeah it knows i couldn't reach that so he just controlled it to the corner better player than me getting a a bad touch if anything i'd probably go straight to my net if i tried to shoot that to be honest they're looking a little bit like nervous and they're getting a lot of like weird miss touches so there's definitely gonna be a mistake soon we just gotta look for it and try to pounce on it when we can it's gonna be awkward for him if anything you might boom it but we just go back and there's no danger in that either y'all try to play off each situation as if it it could go really bad or it could go really good so you got to be in like both spots to be able to react to that right you got to be in a spot where you can react to the good in the spot where you can react to the bad so try to position thinking about that trying to make him panic just by driving up to him force him to have to jump right the challenge from us he's going to beat us here but if i can just go for the bump kills one takes one out of the picture i can go back well if he gets beat no booster but it's fun who needs boost when you can just fit the australian internet oh good fake from garrett holy actually smart i faked me did not think you'd fake that ball alright you messed it up kinda has to go for a weird touch here good demo from him safe from garrett it's fine their touches here aren't going to do a crazy amount to be honest just gotta wait they don't have any danger in display as long as we don't make it have danger but i mean by that as long as you don't challenge it badly and give them an advantage it's fine like they're just panicking in a situation throwing it away gonna be gears ball for free again i was gonna play from him a challenge from gear i went for the air drop bump there i ran out of my flip so i made that weird they're trying to play for 1v1 now so idea what they're doing actually in a challenge like that since gear in a bad spot played it really well though i kind of want him to go for this low key it's honestly fine for us with a soft touch there we go i had a feeling that would work you go quick at it slow down and just tap it around behind a feeling that'd be the play well done from gear to get there super sweaty game but those are the fun ones those are extra fun ones yeah hope you guys enjoyed
