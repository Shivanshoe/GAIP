yo what's up guys gonna be playing some threesome today with johnny and the gimmick should be some good ones it's really late night right now we're actually almost the number one spa we're currently number two we're only 13 points off the number one spot so we'll see if we can get it in today's video let's even get two dubs back to back let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves taha tactical whiffs and pediatrics goes let's stay on this ball played over two it's a pretty good air dribble pretty good play get some pads here behind y'all from johnny gonna go for this should i play it down right good dribble from gimmick good play they almost own gold not quite there sitting on the boost here make him have to flick it over me i get that boost it's fine wait middle he wants to use me got bumped into that's kind of lucky for him there we go get past him johnny what played really good job he got bumped up the wall yeah he did he hit the ball bumped up the wall and still was able to pass the middle i beat the last guy back a good play from johnny in the past ended nice shut up all this up break the fast get a flip push from johnny i'm gonna take my time on this get it over two which is pretty good make him hit it to the corner that's fine it's actually really good it forces them wide there let's say full boost here let's say my boost go back i still have 85 going for this ball on the wall put it to myself like mid now honey should have this little bit of an awkward greed got out well there dropped from gimmick didn't have a touch off back ball tried to play it awkward for him i should have played a faster shot high there i was hoping they'd dive across maybe the low shot work good block there big challenge here like a challenge getting the way that nice one gimmick my bad i bumped him there was in a bad position should be fine better played over one nice little speed-up touch there jeff from gimmick he blocked all the angles necessary there he didn't actually need to even make contact on the ball it's more about just stopping their play from progressing forward i'm actually going to go out of that that's exactly what i'm talking about it's not a bad thing at all that he gets part of the play or that the ball even gets over his head in threes a lot of the time if you block the angle you block their play going forward you're doing more than enough any situation try to bump him here made him jump early which is good again makes him waste his boost make some wastes play you don't have that kind of freedom that you would have within challenger like that it's a good attempt a good idea there we go actually really close let's try on that you touch up the water myself landed right away got a flip almost got the shot and it would have been in but really good save wherever i got back to that the left mid here oh johnny have that behind good pop i like that i'm gonna fake here had a bump good one the back boost one of them's afk for some reason oh my gosh what a save pump the afk guy out make sure he doesn't accidentally save the ball so we like to see all right there we go i ended up forfeiting good first game only time for one more though so let's get into the last one see if we can end it off on another dub see how it goes all right for last game playing it's paul marrow cursed and taha again we gotta talk from last game see if we're gonna end on backed by dubstep over my head i'm gonna go for the back boost wish my teammates luck right to the side here you're gonna turn on this i'll just let him hit my ball here let him touch us again should be giving expo he's backward it's fine it'll be easy for johnny play right can't really follow that let him go for that it's fine gotta bang this away i'm on no boost here so i'll get the back boost stay back i'm 39 years so i save my boost for a little bit push forward it's a good 50. i still have 40 boost as well so i can stay relevant to play if i need to you could play this across let him hit this really good dunk there could have turned into something really good there for sure play middle let's take a shot there there need to be anything too crazy they're trying to keep it in i don't i can't go for like a really fast shot there especially when i'm third man because if i miss out on back wall for example it's gonna be a very very bad situation for me i'm gonna panic a bit go to the wall here go down gonna panic again good win there over two people big challenge we lost the challenge pretty hard there i shouldn't have went for that to be honest that's kind of situation i was talking about earlier if i'm third man there i can't actually go for a shot on that i should be trying to beat him to the corner or something like that johnny obviously could have went back as well mistake on both of us but if i if i can see the whole field it's more on my hands to be more patient there should have played it out more patiently well we've had a lot of pressure already and i'm really in a pretty good position when you've had a lot of pressure this early on in the game i played out the johnny nice right down right here there we go really good plays there well done well done a lot of time on that and again i don't want to shoot that ball there's two there back wall one on the ground one back wall and anything that i shoot there will be saved very easily by them only way that's going to create a lot of pressure is if i pass that gimmick's not going to miss a shot from there there's no way put it around two should be fine i don't mind this all you can do is hit it across hit the sidewall it should be there for that save all my boost off that touch it's a good habit to get into when you're done making your hit try to save the rest of the boost you have left i'm gonna create a good opportunity more often than not go for a bump there take auto boost if you can bang this big i'll go for one more here maybe hit a middle oh it was a good idea the right idea but execution was off a bit wait for the shot here well done good block good touch from gimmick as well again say pull boost back here's third so that when this ball comes to me i can make a play on it really a challenge from him i had a a little bit of a window there but i think if i flipped a little bit earlier i could have definitely had that over him but it was a right idea should be fine getting pads again just trying to go for the same pads over and over again play this side of the field try to cover one side it's fine kind of has to panic a bit here good touch from gimmick puts a lot of pressure on on there good demo from them the background boost also effect a little bit like gimmick but actually really good relief from him if he were in comms or something i would have been ready for it obviously it would have been a really good real play to make i think really good back passes i like both of those touches a lot but the last guy back as well there we go a little bit of adaptation i guess to the weird situation that was happening just landed on them why not bump them weird stuff happens a lot in threes good to be ready to adapt gimmick go puss let him touch this get that's right that's fine you can't get a shot of it obviously a little bit too far from the shoot i'm gonna make him panic a bit better two in third guy i got baited in as well which is really good it's not gonna be on the retreat here and like panicking for these balls same with this guy not the painting for this at normally all thing you'll see is like when one person panics in threes a lot of times it causes like a chain reaction one person goes for a bad ball chain reaction is normally caused and that's when you want to take advantage of it i think it's the most common thing that happens in threes one bad challenge turns into a bunch of bad challenge back to back to back well done though played this game out pretty well a few mistakes here and there but in general when we needed to be there we were there our challenges were pretty good rotations were pretty good we were always where we needed to be which is all you could really ask for all right we got ourselves taha josue and kryptide this goes so yeah one more here mid yes sir really good start we have time for one more we have time for one more so we ran one more back why not first game was a little bit a little bit too quick for my liking i am short on time right now but i do always want to make sure the video is as good as it can be right nice from gimmick there we go good play pass from gimmick well done there very well done match me can i cheat here the justin bieber thing in my name by the way is like a little joke right now that i have like if you guys know cs like zanterra's peak that's what uh i'm talking about but justin version making my own claim justin peak behind here good air drill from johnny what a shot hold on well done you're the control damn it's really good good kick off get the boost as well here wait for his touch better come off the wall a bit i have a mid pass as well there we are good play getting back and forth there stop i'm dying to be ready pass back for the bounce i don't know how i got that past the middle to be honest but i'll definitely take it and we got to go out of it as well i'll play the gimmick must have made a really good touch here that turned into a goal him hit that should be fine pop that up get me down to me maybe get back up to him i was almost insane i tried to play it off the back wall for gimmick day i don't think i could have got that straight into him off the pass i went for the off the back wall pass to him instead gotta fake him let it pick again oh my gosh it's almost insane really good idea all right i will take it i'll definitely take it a lot of goals this game we're absolutely picky for sure we're looking good all right you want to end off on there uh it was a short one just like the first but at least we had a longer video because of it so hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it's when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see
