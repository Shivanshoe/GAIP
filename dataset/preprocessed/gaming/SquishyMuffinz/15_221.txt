getting closer and closer every day and it's thanks to you guys so thank you so much enjoy today's video love you yo what's up guys going to be playing some tuesday with gimmick should be some good ones let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for first game got ourselves uh cap and zazion i'm not sure how to say that but i'm in the middle of eating a cucumber sorry guys the queue has taken longer than expected so i took a bite of my cucumber so yeah that's what you're probably going to be hearing your passion give me to start it all right let's go quick today you have to just commit in a situation like that if i wait it's gonna be hard off my backboard it's gonna be really hard for me to defend that after that so gotta just commit to those situations and just toss this one toward his net see what he does every gimmick good play good block as well i'll try to push on this it is kind of shootable it's not terrible if i could touch his back jumped over the demo as well try to control this faked one no boost for the second but it's fine give me something to just bait it that's a good play i always forget when universal open together i just got a flashback and that play he just made for some reason man i was already like almost two years ago now try to debate in one before passing but everyone's really smart now when it comes to defending that stuff oh no i'm sorry not in a really bad spot i tried to stay on this that's fine if it goes around me give me to get a free ball no real downside today i'll stay across he wants to use me good trying to ceiling pinch i like the idea probably as again like gimmick get there we go good job from giving you know he knows i'm not going to go for that ball there i'm just there to you know have some presents near the ball make them panic a little bit and he got me a free goal just by going for that get it over one better just shoot that close i'll take the corner boost good 50. good idea he's up for that already so i gotta go back play it over the gimmick side let's stay left side here it's going to go up the wall gotta wait let's challenge it it doesn't have to be a go or anything it's just trying to make it as weird as possible for them and now again we can get a free goal it's going to make sure you challenge the right things when someone goes up like that uses a lot of the boost it's a good thing the challenge because very worst case scenario is just a 1v1 situation and you got to trust your teammates to win those when they're in it so it's not really that bad if it does go bad you don't want to go for that obviously whereas if you get beat your teammates not back right those are the ones you want to make sure you don't you don't go for only go for it if you know it's a safe situation after the fact i hit this back now to gimmick try to stay on this myself oh it was close i got two out of the play there just good for us good try from gimmick has a good touch i play it across to him gonna open up some space there we go good play really good of him to rotate across like that it just gives me that option wide across the field hey y'all was passing that one it was a pass oh i don't really know which one you're talking about but i'm just gonna say oh but uh okay well let's give me for you all right so that's a good first game let's get into the next one almost 1900 which is the last avatar boarder you unlock so that's pretty hyped yes the last level reward i think you get um let's get into the next one let's see if we can get another dub back to back i think i wanted to do two for today but i'll record some more with gimmick this whole week will probably be of gimmick honestly i'm pretty tight on time right now but these are always good games to watch and they're good stuff to learn from if you guys want to learn some high level games so let's get to the next one stephen keep it up see if we can get it back to back dub see how it goes all right for the second game playing is luke and brayden i think it's just braden to get this left side i think you mix there your left mid give me soft ceiling good try i'm just gonna oh my on me on me i thought he's gonna dribble i don't know why i went in like that i should have had my back facing him and then if he boomed i react to it then but i was only expecting and only covering one option which is really bad play to make there you should have all options covered if possible or as many as possible for one situation it's the best possible way to play out twos or or ones did i pass again to him there we go good plays good players couldn't shoot again so i just tossed it over to gimmick seemed like the better move to make made up for our first mistake there on defense really that was an offensive mistake but it directly affected a goal going in so i'll call it defense good passes we still got the the pass and synergy gimmick's so probably one of my favorite players to play it's probably like top three favorite players to play with even though we're not on a team anymore we still got that uh that passing synergy down so my favorite thing to do in rocket league always has been just nail a bunch of passes i ran out of my flip on me my fried lip i cannot type right now i've been passing every time so i decided to just blast a shot because he was watching the past there so it's good to mix it up every now and then bad idea by any means oh i think give me a bump there was a good play from them if he did gonna blast a shot see what they do there wasn't a way to set up a pass play there so i think shooting wasn't a bad idea you can delay them jimmy can probably stay on that that's a good play i'm gonna wait still waiting for the pinch there we go okay now we have a free ball until he killed me that's a good demo my gimmick's never free ball again so that's fine that's just them trying to keep pressure any way they can it's a good play from them there we go gimmick was middle as well if i missed that so again all options covered that's like best case scenario gonna be over me i'm just gonna go back i'll give him a little boost for me it's actually really good if you could save this of course it's trying to be annoying i didn't have the boost for it but either way the past a little bit in front of me it's not bad either way trying to make it weird for them there if you have no boost you're next to the ball like that don't flip don't like show your hand too early you know try to make it as weird as possible for the opponent when you can good luck from getting there to beat him and i had all the the power in that situation i have a lot of different options to use so i just kind of faked them all you mix middle as an option try to use them close too obvious of a pass on me shouldn't be passing that if it's that obvious in my opinion i should have probably went for a backboard or um a shot straight up probably would have been a goal honest yeah pass like that if it's not quick enough it's just too readable something like that's good because they've been waiting for the past every single time and i saw like i turned toward the past you see the guy in the wall just turned mid for the pass he saw me taking time there so used my options well once i had them might be in nice safe from gimmick did i have to save another though ah good demo i think jimmy goes ready for it he was nice double i don't want to be too close for that it's a little bit risky if i do get destroyed be back now should be a one-on-one good play good job gimmick you can always rely on him and those uh those one-on-one situations the dominus flicks always been really good with those take one touch here i just toss it off back try to make it weird for them or middle oh imagine oh i mean there's a really good goal still i said all like it was bad it was a good goal still i was just freestyling i'm gonna cheat on this i missed that boost actually ended up being not bad i love those men that fake at the end there fake the fastback the guy just didn't know what to do just stop this check all right good two games hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time knows when you're watching this like comment subscribe i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
