yo what's up guys today we got a very much requested video we got ourselves 3v3 with torment and gimmick with the c9 boys back for a video it's going to be a lot of fun i haven't played these guys in a while together at least i played gimmick a lot but i haven't really played with touring gimmick together all that much since uh since we split up so hopefully we can have some good games let's get into it let's even get some dubs see how it goes all right for the first game got ourselves a grub snazz and warby i recognize everybody in here was pretty good you took a while to find we actually got a really good lobby still i passed the gimmick press the back play back the torments corner actually each other i was trying to see if uh if that fastback was coming to me or not it's kind of hard to tell white middle here i have full boost i'm just gonna chill not to waste any boost right now shoot it low i'm gonna make it more awkward on them than if i shoot that high most of the time i feel like someone's back when you shoot it high it's just not good a lot of time just because you know they obviously can get a much faster hit if you hit a ball fast back while you're they're gonna get a much faster hit going back your way so i like to hit it low just a lot harder for them to do anything with my opinion probably should go again here let him hit this away that's fine somebody should have this for free just stay on this now i got a little bit of a heavy first touch put it over to gimmick good touch there we go my first touch was heavy so all you gotta do is just sit on that ball really just try to be annoying like the first guy there by just literally doing nothing just staying on the ball being aggressive because i obviously had that past middle and they have to be worried about it so the hard thing for them there is to figure out when that pass is actually coming through and if i disguise it well enough it's going to be very hard for them to do anything it's a good demo give storm a lot of space on the wall now i couldn't quite reach out as i couldn't tell what was happening off of his touchscreen that first touch was really weird from this guy i'm not gonna lie it actually worked out really well for him because the position i was stuck in was bad after the fact but definitely wasn't what he was going for at first got a little bit fortunate of the way he landed and the the roller there just too fast i'm going to be able to react to try passes down middle the tour good touch one touch to myself i play mid now good fake nice those corners are so deadly they are crazy come with a little fake midday corners are deadly if you just like sit there and you know don't make any kind of like obvious play like don't make the obvious touch right away you just take a second make them wait make them have to think about the options that you have it's a lot more difficult on them i touch them give me play off the corner let them touch that it's fine i have torment across here pass it back to kim like that's the back again about it i wasn't ready for the next pass back but it's fine i gotta demo so we can keep pressure i'm up in this guy now try to pop him he's close nice clean clean stuff i'm gonna try to be so annoying there so my my planners are trying to just pop it over that guy if i could pop it over him to back wall or just pop it over a middle and create a good opportunity regardless gonna save cheat here never mind they forfeited very early all right i'll play two more then because that was the early forfeit good first game though get into the next one tv keep it up get back to back to back dubs on the day cause you had an early forfeit let's see how it goes go barry and mack one of the people from the last game the first touch here good beat from gimmick i'm going to stay safe here probably has another touch here on there dribble gotta play this middle someone's a little bit further back than i thought in my head that pass would have been really good for a shot but summer is playing the safe the safe route which is smart really close on that play there play it high it's an awkward spot for both of them he has to throw this away now i'm gonna play the corner which is smart i can kill this guy uh i messed up my pass back it was the right idea though for sure almost worked out i wanted i passed the gimmick keep that in play nice challenge played around one here i can't get much more than that but enough to keep pressure up it's a good touch from gimmick try to get the touch here uh i couldn't quite he had it blocked as well so as i played him on defense to be honest it blocked really well let's get it clear i got a beta's touch here so i'm just going to drive up they can get that hit and it should be fine so i'm not going to be able to beat up to that ball right better give my team the ball for free and not waste my position than to waste my position and get the same outcome regardless can you get a very good shot on it because of where i was should be fine i might as well turn into something good in a second all right first touch i'll just keep it in my left side if he wants to go again you should have this on the wall okay first touch try to pop it for tour i'm hitting crossbar in every shot but it's fine one of them is bound to go and we have more pressure than they do just missing the shots by a little bit when getting like this happen most of the time i just i have a feeling that we're gonna win if we just keep up the pressure but it's not really the issue's not getting pressure it's just finishing off the shot right so it's only not the hardest part trying to be annoying here play it back try to keep possession any way i can i just beat this guy try to stay on this i have 40 boost still i miss their corner boosters there's actually a big deal there right there corner boost they're in a much worse position i think it's a good block forcing two of them out it's really good might be bad for us now though let's save oh my god shouldn't expect me trying to go for something crazy you have a touch here you're not boost to reach it but it might still be funny play off the gimmick back to me oh whatever didn't insane if you got it back to you actually they've been crazy this is a good play there oh that's here it's nasty it was good so nice we are crazy i just bumped him off the ball make him go for the bump for me take my time on this so close really good attempt there oh my god that was insane block two one for the bump as well would have been really good i'm going to score i didn't see what happened though watch back to replay i can see it's a really good 50 on both of them there if i was going to get the bump i actually skipped sorry guys i accidentally skipped it but if i was able to get the bump that's why i would have been there the best pack i could have made there i think since the last game of the video let's finish on another dub let's see how it goes all right for the last game we got ourselves the modifying freeze and thunda so we got a sweaty put on here to finish it off see if we can do the patience from tour here he's going to pass this off to the right looks like a challenge simple challenge let me do anything crazy i'm going to put some decent pressure on them gimmick my first touch here see me probably push back to my team most likely i know i went so fast it was crazy touch from tour way back here full boost played off the wall should be finding another challenge for tour oh good he got bumped so it's really tough for him to actually get out of there do anything i shouldn't have went at all there i'm trying to block the shot right the shot actually didn't come through ended up being i missed shot by a little bit and that's what helped him a lot that's why those are really good to do on purpose sometimes to hit it off the wall like that get it around someone because it's just gonna create a really bad situation forever's lost back i don't know if that was on purpose necessarily looked like he was trying to shoot that last ball try to bump this guy so you get a challenge let him hit that it should be touched forward should be fine if he hits as well right behind him here for the 50. probably going to be a 50 coming back my way in a sec so just wait here i really was missing i'm not gonna lie that's how i like playing pros sometimes more than just ranked people because i never know if the right players are missing i know the pros definitely won't miss that so i would never go but rank most time i don't go for that ball ends up being bad i should have i feel like i should have went every time barely able to slide at home but yeah definitely a a true thing playing pros there i'd never even try to go because i know they're never missing it but in rank that i don't especially if it's something i don't know there's a chance they miss so i want to be there let him touch this it's fine never going to be a shot of that pass too fast i'm not sure why he's up for that to be honest not really going to accomplish much but that's good for us if anything he goes for that ball okay hey for his touch here tour i was worried about the bump there was someone that was right next to me bumping so i had to put a little bit patience see that's what i mean okay that was never missed by a pro most of the time and i don't know i'd like to be there for that but obviously it's hard to expect to miss on something i'm used to seeing people hit it's a good win i'm gonna fake now make him just hit it away go for the bump as well make both their situations more awkward than they would like challenge isn't terrible they have a shot off of it but it should be fine pass it right off this maybe should i play it up the wall toward the wall now i don't want to pick this for mid because that's the time that's gonna go badly i'll just leave i'm not gonna do any of that challenge so i could just show yeah not a big deal a lot of these challenges that are going for aren't really going to win them any any like field or anything downfield to help them out so i don't mind letting them get these challenges a lot of the time to be honest not bad for us it's fine as well i thought you really got to think about like when you're going for a challenge or something like is is it necessary to flip into it to like fully commit to the challenge probably not most of the time because a lot of time it touches like i'd say still like 80 percent of touches in a rocket game or useless most of the time i'm not gonna lie people are definitely not as good as they can be still even bros so i just think that like it's definitely get to a point where most touches are like extremely efficient it's not there yet but it's getting there for sure but i don't think anyone anyone is even close to having like all the touches being super efficient right i think like every game there's so many challenges so many touches that are just not useful like that right there that is not useful but something that every single pro does and uh you know we gotta like gradually learn how to make every single touch more and more useful it's just a hard thing to to learn i think and to be like perfect with but like throughout this game alone there's so many challenges that i stopped another team that just don't really accomplish much not much that they're really gaining from it so definitely a lot to learn that aspect for all pros no one's no one is there yet for sure but if you watch any i could watch any pro game and pick out like probably like 15 20 different balls that are just not useful at all to go forward a challenge like every single game within a five minute period so just like a lot of but throughout the game you're always gonna make those touches that's the hard thing right so so much improvement even for pros to make still let's think about rocky i feel like you've never really reached the peak how good you can get in this game it's not all about mechanics a lot of it is decision making what makes a great player is their decision making not their mechanics everyone could do pretty much the same thing when it comes to pro level games now mechanics wise yeah good set of games for today hope you guys enjoyed the games back with the the c9 boys it was fun hope you guys enjoyed that have you have a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all [Music] how could i
