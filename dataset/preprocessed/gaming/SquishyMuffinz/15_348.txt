yo dope you guys did we playing some more games today with gimmick and gear in the last video we ended off at 1971 I believe which is the sixth place on the leaderboard if you win both games today we should break into the top 5 mark and then we're getting really close to the number one spot were actually not too far off the number 2 spot as well we're like 30 points away not too bad at all so hopefully we can get 2 months today see if we can keep it up they're gonna go I have the first game you're playing against dark LX and Toni toné I'm not sure honestly who these dudes are I don't recognize most of them but this was like an insta Q so they're high rank for sure yeah kill this prior shot as well location you can have a pass back middle ok you bump me nice from Garrett that's really awkward spot to be nut bump temperatures good skin delays uh this challenge off the beginning getting kind of cool so I have you push the ball once yet but I got two bumps on the min he was gonna try to challenge so I really just give you make quite a lot of space to work with that scene I didn't mix up screams of gear but I'll back try to kill one like kill another and that's just in I'm a demo mean that's what I do MyPlate there and see what they do I figure I'll have any boost gonna bang it see what they do big pre jump from gimmick he's gonna have it first wasn't pushed up enough for that they pass it back it's good idea get her head it read there it was kind of obvious the only problem with it big fake some gear I'll leave that oh I should almost say that Tigers gonna be little bit closer to his ball in the corner I can be able to challenge really but I think he was gonna get spot for it you know much boost pretty sure I said the dodge the bump Russ a little bit pretty easy save been a game of bumps so far very aggressive all around both teams have any boost showing so I'm a first of all to get decent 50 I try to go for a shot or anything it's more just to get a block that would go up middle forget don't we need to shoot a ball like that or try to extend for sometimes gonna be a bad 50/50 problem think flip middle knew I had a little more time on it getting shot or bumping or something yeah being patient just in case there you go we got a good save there look a shot - I miss a little Sun I wanted something that would be a lot closer to me that I just mistimed it a shot what you got a double not like a go again I got bumped do such a bumpy game he's on the wall - everyone's bumping each other I'm gonna get bumps - you in a sec yeah I knew he's behind me they're just trying to do it back now yet as a goal probably got one counter-attack out of them just going for nothing but bumps pretty much on offense that's a pretty free goal at that point left why should whopper tunity as it is driving to them well another kill this much I'll take it I'm so sorry lashing Garrett all right pretty much on board and the on ball all place did forgive me such you bumped him the facet over to Garrett try to kill me on the pass a little bond then you're half right can they got it that's probably outcome regardless says okay Tony town and give me a kid him with a head ass seems uh got a pretty hostile I'll take it off gear could just behind him at that point but I'm thinking nails going we on the right for the pass I'll jump up the center literally can't wait for the inside the go save and the guy just rolled it on big plays in addition I might regardless it's just like he misses I have a goal if not my team gets it so what's the risk and going you know I wrote downside to it at the Dodger bump there just been a super super super bump every game and this is what ranked is turned into sad scenes uh-huh it's Fisher what is it goals like they should have passed it to one of us mics and then one of the bone bulb accident right interesting I bought me again dude I swear I'm being targeted keep it in its over anyway traffic yeah all right good first game that should bring us one step closer to that top five spot we're really really close I think let me just check real quick in 1975 that does bring us into the top five territory now so if we win the next one will be a lot closer to even the top three spots now so we'll see what we can do the next one Steven keep it up I feel asking her plenty of the exact same team so I expect a lot of bumps a lot of bumps again nothing's gonna change by this middle like to gear a little risky honestly she just played it forward and said what I've always been that way Amanda loves passing bathing well they'll go that's fine I'll take this any day I'll take the Freegal hope you make nurse there's no way that leads us to meet you there's actually no way I can't see it being possible oh my gosh damn let's pull stuff fake surely not right all right this should be a goal one just one for your pretty bad touch they want to enough do you make getting it the kill is a figure goal know what I missed fake them okay now do I jump out of this to save the ball that is the question here is it worth getting out of this just to save the ball here because I can I'm in a position to this is a very weird link-up honestly look we're not even head-to-head so you're just reversing into my side I don't know I just started I don't remember how to start it but pretty interesting stuff just scroll to Twitter here all righty and he's still going so we're two minutes into the game and no one has scored this to beauty however gimmick and Garrett not be able to score yet this is kind of crazy I'm sure to play the game did okay the guy wins they both committed this guy has to retreat now here with the one-on-one the Bangor closer so guys love you just got full pretty much casting at this point gets all the way back they get his time he's trying to slow down with this yeah take one side flip decent pass over go geared always like to slow down in there and she doesn't just bang it away for nothing and tries to keep control at least one extra touch nice if you touch off the wall here probably  you up for this is ready Labiche yeah I could dump them so far is that a bad session giving it almost a free go out of it oh I'll actually kind of nice though I surprises over get the double out of that I'm perfectly back into me it was nice to actually find the game again so it's just went into that all right they met each other up might even be free go there we go look at the pass nice lip you said to slow it down as well they thought I just handed away freely so I was good the guy's back board probably should have had to be honest but I figure touch here all my teammates will be there for this most likely Oh let's get bass for them that's over to gimmick play the killing them couldn't quite reach him but it's fine so force him out can't get the touch that he wanted cuz I was there whatever what what the hell I was getting there - I caught me off guard so hark I'll slaughter you guys are saying at the recording like the quality of the video isn't better as I searched my software so I'm glad it's been good and we'll keep it on this until it gives us dishes again in the future if it ever does but hopefully it doesn't but I wash it back it looked good for the most part waiting on right for passing good for double I was looking for past I would like have a passer but at the same time it's like it's GERD you probably scored that most good time so it's no real downside there I'm at least trying to go for it plate is down middle get beats me to go get pass back another pass back nice little back and forth play all the way down the field so I like to see nice all right that should should put us over top five for sure and I think might also bring us into the top three spots so we'll take a look at that and then I'll end the video then no her dude so we're at 1978 did not that yet it still says 1975 but this bottom number is what we're actually at so in nineteen seventy eight right now we're two points off the number five spot so we didn't break in the top five quite yeah I guess we didn't get as many points we thought we would have out of those games but not a big deal you just play some more try to break into it in the next one but I mean no big deal we get in the next one hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever times in here right now watch this like hum flips gotta see you guys all in the next one I love you you
