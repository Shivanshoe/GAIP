before we get into the video guys as you know we are on the road to one million subscribers and we're nearing the end of that road we're at 980 000 ish subscribers by the time this video comes out thank you guys so much for making that a possibility that one million subscriber montage is done it looks great i love how it came out it's edited by me eclipsed by me everything put together purely by me so it'll be a pure squishy muffins montage like you guys used to get back in the day so i hope you guys will enjoy that thank you for all the support i love you all enjoy the video yo what's up guys so we're one game away from supersonic legend in 2v2 so for today hopefully we can reach it and play one game in supersonic legend as well hopefully we can get the back to back down let's get straight into it see how it goes all right for the first time we got ourselves against bobstove and flitz we have buddy on our team this would be the promotion game i think all high mmr players very solid lobby should take my time on this should i get a good clear it's a good boom away i'll try to follow this now hold on to my boost take a touch first put a soft flick over one that's good enough to pressure at least and my teammate can get a free ball out of it not bad at all to get beat to that ball also because my one montage is complete i'm super happy with how it turned out to be honest so now all it's left to do is hit one mil and then i can release it yeah i'm looking forward to it quite a bit i honestly really like how it came out i think that certain parts of the montage are so sick with the song to be honest the way it lines up with the beat drops and stuff i go there a little bit unfortunate teammate got beat to a ball and then they just counter-attacked pretty easily off of it but it's okay kind of stuff happens just take time here i don't have any boosts he's gonna challenge me let's get 50 teammates not in a very good spot to follow up though so i have to try to help him should be a 1v1 dribble now yeah really looking forward to releasing that for you guys try to take time on this over one that's a good follow-up from him do you should have a shot good try good follow-up good goal as well good work yeah it's crazy i think as i'm recording this video we're at 9.75 right now so we're only 25 000 away very very close couple days thank you guys so much i honestly can't thank you guys enough for all the support on the channel for forever now you guys have always been crazy i'm gonna hit that i don't think you can shoot off this so i'm just gonna wait try to challenge that almost work team is a little bit closer so i didn't want to mess him up kind of made me mess up what i was going for originally but it's okay ended up working out blocked the high play there on the air dribble my teammate had the low we go for a low shot there we go why does that always work i swear instead of just trying to like place the top corner should i get anything on target and it works better it's so weird this game is weird sometimes those are the the turbo shots fire used to shoot like that all the time too fire burner i remember that was like his go-to way to place the ball good dunk from him i should have stopped the back wall i'm gonna try to make it harder for the follow-up guy to shoot there we go i had to put super patient it was really awkward we got it there i had to wait for a shot might be able to shoot this there we go the simple shots man i'm telling you those are the ones you gotta hit let's hit them on target i'm using 110 negative three what's in height negative three angle my normal settings and it feels good i feel like i can hit my shots more i don't overthink my shots i kind of just shoot the way that's going to get me a goal which is what you need to do like sometimes i over complicate things in game like i'll shoot it way more difficult than i need to end up missing when all i have to do is just get it on target right so it's a good thing to try to always get into the habit of just shooting what's going to get you a goal same situation right there like i feel like normally i try to go for a double tap there but just a straight up shot is good because if he does save that it goes off the backboard to my teammate most likely so there's really no downside to it try to just control this in the air 50 maybe that's good keeps a lot of pressure i get these pads now it's a good demo teammate has to play this well i think he did i sit down i can wait for a shot now good job my teammate i'll move forward with pads not gonna waste any boost that way if this ball doesn't get hit toward me i shouldn't have probably jumped for that that's fine though out of it i think you can have a follow-up teammate should have pretty easily i'm gonna start moving to the side popped it up for him i thought he was behind me for some reason i'm gonna fake the straight up hit hope my teammate can get off in my head if i fake that my teammate has a free ball most likely because the guy that hits out the back wall it's not gonna be a good hit but i think my teammate might have got faked by me faking the other guy so it didn't work out the way i wanted how many boosts here i just faked the bounce head over one for free almost gotta go out of i jumped at the perfect time i had to go back now though he's gonna fake challenge this is really awkward yeah i can't he shot at a really good time like midway through my fake challenge he shot it so couldn't really get back i thought he's gonna dribble that's why i fake challenger just to stop the dribble but i should have waited back first and then fake challenge after it would have been a better play i think all good though not going eyes when i first came on in like two days because i worked on the montage the whole time so not too disappointed with how i'm playing considering i haven't really been able to play this weekend i've just been grinding the montage as long as you get the dub when we get the the promotion come down i'll take it a few little mistakes here and there but it's okay let's take a shot off back wall try to go back here i'm gonna go all the way back for our corner boost let's play safe we have a two goal lead here 30 seconds this is a fake challengeable situation i wanted to give the ball away he's not doing it yet but that's fine i could wait to the very last moment to save it was a good idea it was a good job to control that pop this up should i go for a double that's a good try i think i need to slow down the ball a little bit more there it would have been a goal should have this it's a big clear take the mid-right boost i'll just go for a shot open my teammate landed on it but that should be the promotion to supersonic legends we almost got 1k points i think as well so not bad we made a couple mistakes here and there but it's okay it's just the the rusty mistakes there we go we got the promotion in the supersonic legend that's hype we got in two out of three of the game modes now we got to get into 3-3 which is something i'll be working on on the side and i'll make a video we're about to reach it again yeah let's get into the last game of the video our first game in supersonic legend 282 for this season let's get straight into it see if we can get the back-to-back dub for today let's see how it goes all right we're going to sweat a game here we got sea bass we got stealth and knight for the final game of the video winnable winnable everyone in here is really good obviously all very high mmr players see bass i think right now is a sub for kansas city i believe pretty sure oh i should have been a really good play you gotta touch on that i'm wait behind you see if i should be next up to challenge this it's fine i have to get in the way that you don't want to give him a free dribble in a situation i'll take my time on the wall here watch how to fake the jump actually almost worked did like a fake aerial and then i was gonna go for the straight up shot almost paid off so ended up getting sea bass the ball there by shooting which is always good try to keep this in one touch up i was trying to pass middle off that that's fine again i was going for that still give seabester ball so it's not a bad thing at all have full boost here i'm just going to wait in one of those awkward situations like that you want to just be more patient try to kill time for your teammate to get back that's the main thing in that situation i'm alone for a while there oh it's a good idea almost time to flick well i'll wait middle here if he wants to use me i'm not going to go for that straight up again sebas isn't back for a while here so my goal is to kill time hit it to his corner there's kind of empty space there for a second if i can get a kill on him that'd be huge i'm gonna go back now should be over temporarily it's a good play in hindsight i should have just backflipped i've done anything to to help seavester because he couldn't challenge i was hoping he could challenge after i was on the wall but hard for him to know what i want to do there obviously it's not going to be in i don't think should be fine nice he's gonna turn on this that's fine not bad for us to be honest we're not gonna have much out of this we have a free ball after the air dribble see best should be able to get it nice all right now i gotta wait this is one of those weird situations where you have to kind of play patient wait for your teammate i couldn't shut up challenge off that that's fine see if i should have trying to get some boost here because he's low boost right so we want to be in a spot where we have boost so we can help him out over another one it's a good touch from him see if i should pass this hopefully not exactly to me but we could still work with that over one i can't recover it under my back nice play i got launched into the wall just on my back not being able to turn around so helpless just falling down the wall nice from sea bass good touch i kind of creep up on this side now i'm trying i go for this make it ready for them i'll be behind him here full boost so he has all the freedom to challenge now i have a lot of time on this ball heading up for something alone here everyone so good at pre-jumping that stuff now like i get to get players so hard to get plays like that these days unless they mess up like they have to mess up for that to work i feel like it's like no in between anymore try to go with the back wall i was gonna be in that was a good safe from them trying to go back here okay see what's gonna be behind me so i'm gonna say this to the left side most likely it'll be fine for him good patience good flick he's gonna be awkward here gotta just get that on target there we go like i said last game when it comes to high level play now it's all about hitting your shots you just have to be able to hit your shots you got to be mechanically consistent enough to to make sure you're hitting the important ones right not necessarily about how good you can air dribble anymore because everyone's so good at defending them i feel like it doesn't even matter like that didn't really do much that was a mechanical play for me but i didn't do much right it's more about just being in the right position and playing smart you should have this across i'm gonna let him hit it to be honest it's fine it's your best jump so i'm not gonna waste any more boost still full boost back here so i kind of canceled all that double commit made it better made the situation better i'm going to challenge it away i know office first touch there he's not going to have any any kind of playoff past middle there we if you go someone straight off their first touch like that they can't do anything right he lost control i knew lost control so don't give them time to gain full control of the ball before you challenge right you want to try to stop any kind of play from being able to be created that's a good play from them it's gonna be cool good job sea bass couldn't exactly challenge off of it it's well done yeah he turned if he fake challenge that and didn't go i think it would have worked better but again hindsight is of course 20 20. that's something you learn from right if i'm him in that situation i look at that and i try to learn from it not going to be in should be fun i couldn't reach i don't know i even tried to to be honest it wasn't passed to me i don't think i think he was just hitting him into the wall i thought maybe he was supposed to be past me so i went i should know okay i was almost scary because he could have ground pinched i was trying to cover like four options should be fine though hold on to boost here all he has here is an air drill he's gonna waste his boost so i'm gonna wait till he has nothing and then i'll just go after should be all sea bass so i hope you can get his touch nice little weight in the goal here on the inside all right we got everything blocked every possibility was blocked there because if it did hit the ground it's going to end the game obviously i'm blocking the high that's the main thing you have to worry about in a zero second situation block the high always force the ball low that went to the game right so not a bad thing if that gets under me that's the whole the whole situation there it's not a bad thing at all all right there we go there we have it we won our first game in supersonic legend i think we played pretty solid we got the goals we needed to get we got the shots we needed to score a couple mistakes here and there but that's just rust honestly because i haven't played this weekend this is the first game on a little bit so but yeah guys thank you so much for
