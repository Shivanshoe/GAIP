what's up guys so it's the brand new season playing my placement games now with justin it should be some good ones let's get into it already played two games we won both hopefully we can go undefeated that way we can start up high up on the leaderboard um i think that there are some people already at like 1600 mm i'm not sure what that is like rank-wise i don't think anyone's supersonic legend yet uh just came out too long ago so pretty brand new here playing against someone named grand champ or someone named bronze so we'll see how this goes but yeah i don't think anyone's super sonic legend yet i'm not sure what the mmr splits are i'm sure it'll be announced like really soon or someone will just read super sonic legend pretty soon i'm guessing one of the pro players hopefully we'll reach it soon i can let you guys know give you guys info on it and we'll be doing the road to supersonic legend series pretty soon as well i want to start that up it's a goal of mine a lot of you guys are asking me to do that in the previous video where i talked about the update so yeah really looking forward to free to play as well we have a lot of new players coming to the game got a bump there let's get a bump from uh from bronze good job from him justin go alone here get fake it's gonna be eagle in a sec probably if i can beat this guy potentially never mind wait there it is yeah we had a lot of pressure that one miss or that one beat on the back wall that i got on that guy was uh pretty big because no one can follow it up for a while one shot we had a top hunter for the season unlucky get 50. there we go it's a good shot i like the single jump for those 50s because you can land much quicker you can recover straight away that's easier to get a good shot of it after the recovery pass over to justin let him go for the double i'll try to pass back middle for some reason i'll pass back this to justin again i'mma leave now pass to the right side again there we go a lot of little passes but they work that's pretty much always been my play style it's always have tried to play i'm trying to look for my teammate at all times um it's obviously a lot easier when you're playing with players like that are very good at the game like pro players oh oh dude that would have actually been ridiculous i'm actually so sad that we didn't hit that i saved the replay i was nuts dude holy actually one of the best goals i ever got like you've been a part of i think that's like the perfect back and forth we both went for kickoff we kind of kind of messed it around there but that wasn't nuts dude damn that would have been perfect kind of sad that was the first time i've like felt sad after gold didn't go in in a while especially because we were actually recording playing high he's gonna be really awkward might miss it's a free goal for justin he banged it at the crossbar he just played i i'm faking this probably adjusting the ball for free i could try to bump this guy help him out went up early play back here fake them i'll stay right side oh we got killed should be okay though i'm gonna full boost now i can fake this it's fine again my goal is always to get my teammate the ball for free so those fakes like that are really good because i don't have to go for the ball and look what happened my teammate gets the ball for free here put it off the back wall for him i'll play this middle to him again close good dunks from them they're reading the passes now i might have to switch it up a little bit but it's been working still we still have a lot of pressure out of it pass it back to him he passed it back that guy's no boost i think i played just inside the ball movement's crazy right the now [Music] this is the funniest game actually we can't hit the net bro we're crossbar kings right now a decent shot it's gonna force that a play you could pass this to me close just faking it i'm not gonna get a goal out of this i can start moving forward potentially for a play here couldn't pass he's just staying on it that's fine it's a good idea i get this boost like a pass maybe oh i thought i had my flip it must have just ran out there we go the banger yeah a lot of good plays though passing the ball around well [Music] i'm not sure who he's talking to so i don't really want to answer unless he says the name because could very easily be toward justin i think they might have given up though i'll pop that should i hit at the ceiling no way dude how did they save it you know they're saving everything they're like just getting back to all the cool place the double pass it back maybe trying to give an option middle if he wants to use it just waiting now i'm going to bait this out same idea as before i know if they beat me on a challenge here i goes straight to my teammate so it's really no reason for me to flip into this ball just trying to make it as easy as possible for justin after he isn't a good spot for it it's a little bit weird in the corner but we take it that's how two's is these days let's get to brazil 26 seconds need one more there we go there we go finish it off with the bizarre all right good first game to start it off let's get into one more for today justin's banner looks sick that combo looks really nice i actually want to get that i want to figure out how to get it but yeah these guys are already ranked right now so it's going to be uh going to be interesting to see what the threshold is mmr wise to get into the the higher grand champs and supersonic ledge and stuff like that all right let's get into the next game steven keep it up let go let go all right this is definitely going to be a sweatier game hockey uh is a very solid high mmr grand champ player from last season so we'll see not gonna be easy one whatsoever playing against robo as well who's solid got the bump on him oh you have to bump on me that time killed one and try to kill the other one maybe he's gonna just go for it right away that's fine i have 90 boost let justin get that nice everybody admit if he wants to use me doesn't have to i'm just here as an option he goes for the solo it wasn't the best spot to get that honestly off the 50. let's get from justin he's probably gonna score off this though yes sir there we go good goal good pressure good idea to go for the solo there nice everybody on the right side he's gonna go alone probably probably for the preset there we go this is the life of uh being justin's teammate i don't have to do anything i just get a watch give him the ball as much as i possibly can and uh yeah the rest is pretty easy it's the beauty of it there we go lose the challenge on purpose give justin the ball let them hit it just in the can preferably this is fine so i'm not going for any of these there's no reason to i mean the majority of the time it's just going to go over to your teammate if someone's beating it to the ball like that so really no downside to it try to get this mid he wasn't going to be close in threes it'd be close for that because it's gonna be like somebody back wouldn't be a a bad idea let him hit that off the wall to my teammate again one's bumping it's actually really bad for them because now justin's gonna have a free dribble most likely and even then that's fine as well don't even have to go for these balls i'm not even challenging and they're kind of panicking and throwing away possession right away i'm just gonna bait this again let's drive into them keep driving into them dude you gotta love twos bro you see justin just bulldozing them over just driving into him it's already all it is now man trying to sit on the ground as long as possible truly is beautiful the purest form interesting somehow it works all right i gotta do one more i think because that one was just way too quick but that was a solid game i didn't have to do much justin got a flippy set in a good ceiling shot so didn't have to really do a whole lot but we'll take it they're ready grand champ one as well i think that's screenshot so let's get into the next one see if we can get some more dubs let's see how it goes all right playing some more hi to kmart players here duck and sin so we'll see if we can end off with a dub here try to stay undefeated in these placement games that way we can uh start with the highest possible rank adjust and go for that nice gonna be there i'll try to just pressure it there's no reason not to good fake from justin just faking you i wanted to give us the ball again justin the good good bait trying to give justin the ball again by just baiting it out there we go full boost middle now he's gonna be able to make some sort of play so i get it off back wall wasn't the best because they can just get a dribble out of it and they got that goal as well that's really hard for justin to save like i just got good control out of it i was hoping justin be able to be closer but it's hard for him to know that's gonna go because it doesn't it doesn't look like i'm pinching it right so you got to be ready kind of like left or right to go for that there we go we will take it a good air dribble to control that round one there gonna get 50 at the end that's so 1v2 play justin has control now so i'll be back full good job see if he can do it too and he does both just doing the same thing to him i think he likes to go for these in twos and threes normally i always go so it's a little bit uh confusing for me sometimes and twos i have like that muscle memory of just going i've always been like the kickoff guy in threes let's say from justin tried to pass could have probably just kept going myself would have been better but justin might still score off this honestly double tap close i had to wait there should i let him go for me that's good good play 52 of them made the main justin's at 1v1 now good try it's going to go up the wall gotta go back here try to stay on this if i get this boost that'd be huge pass down nice i'm gonna fake on full speed here oh it's a bad pass a little bit too far from actually get a shot of should have placed the pass better my first touch try to fit them can't go again but i still kept pressure in the corner so it's not bad it doesn't get a touch here for free i go first fake the shot pass back oh i should have just shot in hindsight i think they're just expecting the pass every time shot there might have actually been a goal anyway oops on me my perception was weird i honestly thought justin was closer i tried to like pre-position for a pass but you should never really do that because you don't always know if your team is going to have it so you should position in a spot that you can react to both situations like the absolute worst case scenario and the good situation should be able to turn for both ah i couldn't quiet first touch was too heavy one too far ahead of me couldn't follow it up i'm gonna freestyle pre-jump never mind i'm going back down any high off back well i want to make it weird for him i'm not gonna challenge quick i'm gonna fake i'll be back now i can actually commit to it there's no danger there we go hold my flip there for a while that way i can react to either situation pass down to justin off wall i'll fall again he's back so i'll hit this back he's going again so i'm just gonna leave i thought it was a pass at first but it's better for him to stay on that himself if he can doesn't waste two players for that play just baiting it out i'll try to kill him now or bump him off a bit i've adjusted as the ball it's a little bit awkward for him i don't think he expected me to do that but his 1v1 now and i'm pretty sure he'll score this he's pretty pretty confident these spots wait for the hit down nice i can hit this back middle double close i'm gonna try i'm gonna die there nice 50. don't take our boost but i have pads i always get those little pads if you get the the big ones taken that way we could be in a better position to score potentially i'ma hit this back give him time on the ball it's okay to reset sometimes like that you don't always have to move forward i think some people forget that there is that pass back option whenever you want it good cut should have the ball for free here try to 50. all right it's gonna be a little bit awkward now cause i don't have much boost i should just go and try to 50 to the side i can get a lot of boost here from pads this is a good spot where you should try to collect pads because i know justin's gonna kill as much time as possible for me so even if it is toward the net i can still get back there it takes a lot of the danger i know especially especially when you have somebody who who can kill a lot of time it's really good to do something like that because you can just get ready for the next save even if you are a low boost going to ot here justin should have the save here we can actually counter off this doesn't get to get touched to me try to block them what is that bounce dude i tried to read it but it bounced so weird for me good touch she's gonna have that though play this down right there we go all right good games for today let me
