yo what's up guys going to be playing some more extra modes with justin for today we'll be playing some drop shot games a lot of you guys have been asking me to play drop shot and i haven't played any yet so today will be our first drop shot games on the channel for this season i played it in the past way back but it's been a long time so hopefully we get some good games hopefully we can pop off all right the first game we got ourselves i can't read the names the game's starting too quick wow this game is so much more filled with action normal rock league feels like you're just straight into potentially getting scored on it just feels like so much more dangerous for some reason pre-jumping actually a good read pass to my teammate actually a huge fake even i messed it up fakes are probably like gigantic brain in this if your teammate hits the ball to you and you just don't hit it at all you just do one big fake just make them panic super hard probably big brain that's right from justin i'm gonna fake this make a panic oh it's huge ah i honestly wanted to flip there i messed up run that on my flip i got a touchdown i was just huge got some more damage on our side nice got the touchdown drop shot's actually a really fun mode it's a lot of fun something about it just feels like super intense the whole time at all times it feels like at any point in time like the game can change really quickly you get scored on in an instant if someone like ground pinches it's like a bunch of touches with the ground super quick teammates shouldn't let that bounce probably extra time there he's a little risky but it should be okay this is a super risky spot yeah at any time it just feels like the lead can change and switch around to always be like on alert there's so many different places you have to watch because the nets are all like dynamic right there is no set in stone spot where you can score it's kind of just everywhere it's really a tough thing to keep track of the skill to be able to keep track of that well i'd say wasn't exactly what i wanted there but it'll do what are these bounces we've walked i don't know if you guys saw that that didn't seem normal though sounds like up really oddly there it's always kind of been a thing and drop shot if i remember correct unlucky ended up bumping each other there she go again nice shall we right wall i can read them to be huge get some good damage our way right side again here oh my god wait what 104 miles per hour that was crazy but that was actually crazy what that seems so fast i also like the idea of the kickoffs being in the air i wonder how like normal rock thing would be if the kickoffs were airborne especially for a 1v1 i feel like the shots would be not to ariel for once same would probably go for threes to be honest just don't ariel as well probably the better play i can kill him and be big he's gonna try to dribble a little bit unlucky hit my teammate but won't be too bad get a challenge on that it's gonna miss good touch from justin probably has one more here i'll let him hit that it's a good second touch gonna make it really awkward for them and justin can follow that up nice i want to say that i look like in real time like on the replay i turned off ball cam as i hit it to look a little bit weird i think but okay that was kind of what i wanted that's what i was going for good start though i say start but the game's over halfway done already good read from us so i hit it around two of them try for my teammate i mean justin both almost had a thousand points right now already i'm pre jumping to the left close i don't know why i tried to freestyle that we have a three goal lead here the thing is i feel like if you do have a more than one goal lead in this game mode it's pretty easy to hold on to it i feel like that's one thing that is different from other modes a one or two goal lead is like equivalence i would say like a three four goal lead in a normal game it feels like it's a lot harder to get goals back that much that quickly at least you can make like a one or two goal come back but i think three goals is very difficult because even though they did get that goal they had that hole on our side pretty much the whole game and it took them four minutes to actually get to go out of it and now they have to start on a brand new surface right where it's completely unbroken so i have to start breaking down new tiles and they can do that but they have to start really quick it's not a very hard thing to you know kill time and not let too much damage start to build up on your side it's a really good touch from them just out of reach of all of us kill better time is dwindling down pop it over one good play for my team put it over one again nice a lot of speed coming out from us this game mode is a lot about who's the faster team our team is pretty speedy i've been playing pretty speedy this game so we're definitely going to have the advantage i'd say one more touch from justin here put that high see what they do one more over to him nice one more goal oh the zero second almost all right good first game let's get into the next one let's even get back to back dubs for today i'm pretty sure everyone in this lobby is already grand champ three so almost super sonic legend but yeah let's get into the next one let's even keep it up let go again all right for last game plenty is some similar players from the previous i believe darien herbie and panda i think i recognize should be fine though try to keep it in oh sorry didn't mean to cut him off there right behind full boost nice tim is behind me i think i hear him i'm just gonna wait for the bounce here you should have that good touches it's gonna be down probably it's gonna be hard for them to keep up nice probably as well more here justin go for this nice so what i do remember i used to play drop shot quite a bit like back in the day when it came out what i do remember is when the ground is like prime like that like when it's already blue if it's about at the ground just like pre-jump that slam it at the same tile and it's gonna be a go every single time it's something that you have to try to remember i always tried to keep that in mind in those situations that was good from justin to pass like that cause i can just get a free go out of it try to just bait out the pop from them to get beat from us and my teammate beats here it's huge i keep on messing i'm dressing that i mean too there though nice should be fine there's a good bait got the ball back here he's gonna have a touch don't touch that again actually both of the same idea a lot of times like that will happen in high level lobbies like two people have the exact same idea and they'll like slow down they'll fake a challenge then they'll go for the challenge the exact same time because they think it's the right thing to do but both people think it's the right thing to do so that's when a double commit gets dangerous and someone does the exact same thing it's not necessarily a bad thing it just means you're like-minded in the way that you think but and lower rank i'm sure it happens too just at a different scale where the ball's in the air no i think i should go for the ball and that's the extent of you know the double commit which i guess in a way it's the same kind of thing in high rank but most of the time it's just two people having the exact same thought process and not really looking at the other the other teammate do you guys should go for this don't want to give too much time and ice was justin back let it bounce it's gonna get a touch there i feel like because it gets some more damage instead of just letting it bounce to get once out of the way i think we got a bunch more out of that not a bad situation at all for us should be okay good defense good fake as well nice good goal well plato played should i go for this quick i think the more above that ball you can get on kickoff the more chance you're going to win it if you get two below it that's when it gets back it's probably gonna get over your head so i would say for that kickoff and drop shot if you're trying to get better at it or if you understand how you can win it that would be what i would tell you try to get as many touches away from them as i can being as annoying as possible [Music] my stress should go again here let's hit play close we gotta touch down it would have been huge probably there's one more here i'm gonna fake should i go for a shot be a little bit cheeky don't touch that okay it was almost super dangerous had to be as careful as possible here teammates should have it nice definitely dangerous look how much of a gap there's on our side here trying to keep it in play back to justin's side should have ah too much of a a net to shoot on there it was pretty massive teammate didn't get the touch he wanted he wanted to go up the wall probably we both went but it should be fine we have a very blank canvas here on our side they haven't gotten any damage then obviously because there's got to go so we should be okay temporarily let them touch that i said again that's fine good fakes makes them panic a little bit it's good to show presents in spots like that makes the opposition kind of panic a little bit justin should have this good shot yeah that's almost impossible to stop i feel like because the only way you can stop that is if he doesn't flip most likely if he like dribbles it then hits it to the the part of the hole that like would bounce the ball up but even then it's extremely difficult nice operating middle plate off back wall nice should i put this up the wall maybe i was trying to like wave dash backflip onto the wall i think that would have been the play wouldn't have been a bad idea at all it's good fakes twitter behind should have this most likely that's fine baiting that out for me is not a bad thing at all because it ends up going to my teammate regardless bigger kill that's gonna be a game anyway they can't can't do anything else try to get one more touching this side maybe i messed it up kind of hopefully you get something good out of my teammates but it works all right i hope you guys enjoyed another two good games in the book ended up catching two dubs in a drop shot for today if you guys want to see me play any other extra modes or have any ideas for me i kind of want to do a 7v1 vs golds i feel like that's a really good idea that i've wanted to do for a while i just haven't had seven goals to do it with so i'll be looking for people to do that with but yeah i'll be looking in the comments probably and i'll probably tweet about it so if you guys aren't following me on twitter go follow me on twitter right now at squishy muffins and i'll probably tweet about when i need someone golds to help me out with video ideas like that so yeah appreciate y'all hope you guys have a wonderful day or night or every time this you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
