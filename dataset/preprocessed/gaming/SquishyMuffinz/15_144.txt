yo what's up guys gonna be playing some games for today with turbo and gyro who just recently joined face a huge congrats to gyro on the the face pickup as you can see looks really dope in game yeah super sick to see phase and rockley man it's been so long everyone's been waiting for forever c9 left and kind of have a big org to fill that that void now now that phase is back there crazy crazy crazy stuff good job from turbo and of course we're playing with turbo as well who that's one of the most world championships in the game so got some uh pretty big names with us here for today today's video good for turbo's touch my jaw get a good hit here wait behind him he's gonna wait he's backward but i can make a panic a little bit let turbo go it's a decent block for us because y'all get it to me now if not that's fine because they're still in a pretty bad situation to be honest a a touch from turbo good block from jar i'm gonna go all the way back here i think it's a safer bit rotate a little bit wider let him flick this that's fine so i played over him over the turbo side a block from us try to stay on this try to just block them that works fine though i'll play from turbo good demo from gyro i'm going to leave turbo with a wide open net he's never going to be missing that one maybe well played from gyro there he's not doing anything abuse and that's out of the field and i just landed there so best way to make himself useful just swing on through for the demo and turbo gets a really good touch over the other player there a little bit weird i don't know what happened i kicked up here went backward and then the cheater just went for the demo on me which made it really difficult and i think you might have bumped gyro as well so well played good bumps to go for and they're part i don't know what i just did that was a weird wave patch to be honest one more touch middle here i'm trying to pass over to gyro i didn't even see turbo underneath me thinking maybe i can fake the high shot and shoot low there works against pros especially because pros expect every other pro to shoot it perfectly that didn't work in that situation that's my back wall here can't do much in this situation gyro is challenging off the ceiling as well so we have pretty much everything covered every option they had good ceiling turbo dropped a little earlier than i thought as well there i was trying to put in a weird spot for the opponent but it must have worked out okay for us here push forward for gyros touch close still push forward on the right side or turbo touch get a good counter downfield it's gonna put a little bit of extra pressure on them that second touch whereas if i just left it off with turbo touch it would have been a lot easier for them to deal with i'm gonna take this back corner yeah i should have this good try got one more out here most likely it's a really good dunk for him good block from turbo maybe one more middle here i'll take my time play it off the wall now played it patiently because i knew i couldn't get a really good touch on that right down to me oh played it soft so you had time to control the next touch and maybe we can get something cool out of it but a little bit unfortunate able to play that over one around him again maybe even a dunk not a bad outcome there at all considering having no boost going to that i don't know how i saved it but i'll take it i obviously thought we were we're screwed there they were just going to score out of that but we'll take it sometimes the rocket league gods are on your side and normally you could tell when they are and when they're not but nothing's going your way they're probably not so turbo take that right side now a lot of space here pass back over to turbo close i'm going to fake this one teammates are both stuck in the net so not good to commit to a shot there when it could go very badly i should have this one more to me close i'll be back here the bump actually doesn't affect me too much it's not a pretty good position to deal with this it's fine get 50 from gyro turbo should shoot this on a bad try play back mid to gyro maybe a double try again middle again mystery from turbo but it's okay one of those balls that like the slightest to the left or the slightest to the right changes the bounce so much so it's a tough one to read almost always better to wait an extra second just to see where it ends up and then go for the the early read it doesn't really give you an advantage a lot of the time they earlier be on some of those plays you can tell you how to double i'll just go back here this place is always going to be into the backboard so as long as our way back while we have everything covered there we go good first game a lot of weird stuff happened to be honest but a good first game regardless let's get into the next one stephen keep that get back to my dubs see ya guys all right for the last game we got a super sweaty match here we got a dapper porky and linear see how this goes i should be able to land on this wait that was just in actually would have been crazy went for a bump there which is a good thing to do creates a lot of danger i'm gonna have to deal with should be free save for us put it around one fit the other one let him just touch that should be fine someone's back wall good position to deal with that from good pass from gyro grabbing some pads here adapter go not a big deal play a beat it's fine as well that's a big challenge because of course that guy not be able to force the guy not to be able to follow it up good demo as well from us it's fine as well not a bad situation for us at all pumped one here gives her about a free shot good try i went for a double not a bad idea here whether they're playing their defense out doubles one of the few things that would actually work wait for gyros touch try to just snipe the top corner shot was a good try one of them was just sitting back wall though so it didn't quite work let's get a bump from them almost messed me up enough just able to get back there i'm gonna take my time better bang a shot here force two out which is big they can get another shot of it and there we go forcing a double commit like that and a fast shot is really good also guys one tip for the walls that might blow your mind that helped me a lot way back i started thinking of the walls as just the ground sideways so just think of it like that and maybe you'll be able to get more power on your shots from the walls and it'll feel more consistent to you i don't know if that'll help you guys it helped me way back but i even started thinking of the ceiling as just the ground upside down so that's how i got good at two shots and and wall wall stuff in general i started thinking of everything as everything is just sideways that's how i thought of everything and made it a lot easier to me so let me know if that tip helps you guys out it's a weird thing weird thing that i just thought of one day like way back this is like 2016 i'm talking maybe 2015 and while stuff was very new still the game just came out not long ago i just applied it to ceiling stuff as well yeah i couldn't really save that at that point it got over gyro really close to the net so effectively when it gets over him that close to the net it pretty much turns into a 1v1 it's not much i can do after a certain point so should have been positioned in a different way to also account for the chance of that going over him that's where i made my mistake but after i am where i am there there's not much more i can do i got a little confused but should be fine so it should work out okay for us pass down left close grab this mid boost here he's gonna backflip why not see if he does maybe don't come that's fine all you could do now since i forced him up is just play it forward into my team so we're always gonna win the next challenge pretty much guaranteeing that my team wins that ball just by driving there pretty big thing there to do small detail but actually does a lot for us good win there in the air turbo should have this forward to me one more i would have been insane oh my god i got a flip and i almost was able to backflip as well and tuck it in would have been crazy good 50 go straight to turbo dodging the bump just in case i heard one was really close to me i don't want to go for it since i saw him jump there's no point i get beat to it i'm gonna fake the big hit make him have to panic a little bit play it around one hit another one like two out of the play on that one challenge i can even bump the third make it even more difficult unfortunately turbo dunk gyro still gets a little bit sketched for a second here i'll be back post and decent boost should be over sorry looks like he's bumping dapper ah a little bit unfortunate it's a good try i was so focused on what's happening beneath me good dunk from dara i was so focused on what was happening beneath me if jarrod got the bump or not i kind of stopped focusing on the shot for a second really good dunk from gyro well played i this what a game for sure to end off on got a minute left two goal lead definitely can hold on here fork is off the roof gotta be careful with the challenge play the gyro back wall nice good play from gyro play back down passing play all right guys it's gonna be here for this and i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
