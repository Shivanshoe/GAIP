yo what's up guys but today's video gonna be queueing all three game modes whatever we get we'll play let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes all right we got a pretty sweaty game here we got 4k against chicago and torment very interesting first match let's go quick try to block them because they're both very good at twos obviously on tournament but it's very good at the game in general porky as well very solid player good all-round lobby i'll be like this is all about though you're just playing solid playing consistent not making too many easy mistakes not giving anything for free try not to you know make the make the easy mistakes because that's what they want you to do is make those simple mistakes make the game easier for them right all these players you make any kind of error they're going to capitalize on it right away just gotta be very careful the one thing about lower ranked games you can definitely get away with you know making those mistakes way more often these games no it comes down to like one thing most of them bring it around because i don't want to get a free touch much better to have him have a hard time get control of the ball than to just leave it for him for free unlucky we at try to get back to it i just had too many options there i was lost back for a very long time it was a good first save for sure should be okay [Music] how do i go so far i'm trying to get like a soft touch i ended up blasting it back too could be okay though hit to the side should flick this it's a good block trying the shot might be a goal for them but they can get back barely could hopefully before we get to get everyone here kill some time for me as well only that's what's really good about air dribbles like that no matter what rank you're at kills so much time allows your teammates to actually move forward get boost whatever it may be it's almost always a good thing to go for an air dribble like that just slow down time as long as you don't get dunked there but it's like the only thing that could go wrong being dunked like really badly somehow getting me to be there i think a fake tour it's fine should be okay for a bit nice good fake really good flick too plus very unlucky actually kind of just fell into the path of the ball [Music] pop it up make it weird for him working should be next here anything he does here is good just make him hit the ball that's fine he'd have to go again but it's fine he's trying to make sure let him hit that should be okay i'm gonna play the control touch here fine should be awkward for tour for a bit my first flip it's fine i didn't only have one more touch max i could follow it up try to do something off of it parker's gonna waste all his boost actually you get situation for us to be honest targetly his only rule here is try to kill time so as long as you overcome it there's no real way you can get scored on and now we have one more one as well pretty good situation there we go we gotta go out of it jet spot is really all like i know it's so much decision making that goes into that because four keys into challenge um that air dribble that kago had is so really pointless to do that because that whole air drill is never going to be an attempt on that it's more just trying to kill time to put the rotation back together so the fact that he didn't go for a challenger is so huge oh yeah another pump and that's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes you get the situations you play it right good maneuver around cogger there i know he's gonna go for a bump there i know he's trying to do anything to help tour and he's ahead of the ball so he can't get in the way that's close it's actually really good play super super close to getting the perfect flick there let's try from 4k that's fine should be easy don't mind that touch i would have liked maybe if you just left it for me to get like a much bigger hit but actually gonna work out pretty well here still really good demo to 1v1 now good touch around actually really good trying that i was just going for a bum it's okay shouldn't be too big of a deal good challenge maybe a shot here i'll try i'm just gonna wait patient right i'm last man back focus i'm gonna help me yet now i'll go because i know forks will be behind me by the time i can actually challenge this there's no way anything can go wrong there really should be okay actually empty net working shoots holy let him hit that click this boost maybe bump tour i can't actually reach this nice really good play the important both of 611 points really solid there i knew torque couldn't reach it so i was just playing the miss could pop over cargo you can't go for it and then a really good air dribble to follow it up perfect game well done couple mistakes here and there from both sides to be honest but it's okay solid lobby stuff like that will happen play one more game for today hopefully we can get a dub to get into it see him keep it up i'll see how it goes all right for last game we got 4k again against dorito and tristan this time so another sweaty lobby really good set of players again twos is always going to be a little bit random in these scenarios i feel like but it's fun still part of the excitement of it take my time here it was solo i know there's not much boost so i can play it over and probably i'll look for the angle a little bit ambitious i went for like the perfect ankle from up there that was a good try still really good flick porky i can't actually focus on this let him hit it away one more time i know he can't reach the second ball here so i can sit around i'm not going to go for this again actually i'm going to leave it take the pads on the way out nice nice shot from porky good job to read that actually it's really good well done right to the wall for myself he's gonna wait on this i know i can fake think again maybe it's a good play i try to go for the low that's a good read though the fact that we knew he was going to wait she was very important i almost got to go out of it let him hit that take the boost as well be pretty big actually i'm just gonna backflip if you guys ground that's fine i can stay on this now okay put a bump tristan all right i wanted to stay on this ball i don't do anything too crazy and then fake interesting and i have free play on this that's all i have to do it's a little bit of a fake it's a really good play to make again doing nothing is sometimes better than doing something especially against really good players the players will have the read on you most of the time right so you want to try to get in their head do the opposite of what they think that you're going to do that was a really good example of that really good job goodbye both of them really good lobbies though today actually saw the players all these lobbies one more touch gonna leave that should be good for porky he wants to go it's fun it might still be bad for me though one touch so i can really do good flip it's going to kill some time you have to respect the fact that you could pinch that right huge huge dunk there actually play it around good job fork you left that booster that was huge had a pinch with him maybe go ceiling to myself i'm not trying to score this it's more just trying to kill time doing a good job with that blocked both of them and 40 should have a free ball now it's a really good situation knowing when like when not to go for a shot in a situation just so like such a hard thing to learn too i feel like everyone wants to always go for the shot they want to be the one to create the play right but a lot of time not even going for a shot in this spot like that is like so much better so much better than trying to go for a goal and forcing something that i can't even come anything if i just bump him here play it all the way back not a fork he said give him so much space on the ball let's just go for a shot maybe let's get a try it's actually a really good shot show some time i'm gonna fake it don't panic much space i gave myself because of that it's a really good pre-jump i just blocked them because 4k is pre-jumping my pass so i had to be really careful on that should be okay as long as you challenge as well really good challenge actually put up backward i just don't want them to get a good touch on this it's gonna be hard for him again not going for a goal there right because if i go for a goal they save that porky's landing on their side i'm falling on their side i wanna see in a really bad spot if that situation happens should be fine you can't shoot i'm gonna stay in front now huge flick and i have 1v1 i'll probably just go for a bump honestly it's going to be pretty hard for him here we go thank you really the game's later though like these games are super super good i love playing these zombies really solid it's pretty rare that you get lobby's this good two times back to back honestly it's gonna be a goal good job it's a good flick from him i think fork he missed other boots the other mid boost would have been back because usually it's fine to go for a challenge i did there timing would normally make sense too maybe awkward situation again but should be fine force them high enough oh a little bit of panic and four key yeah it's gonna get him square we're good it's actually a really good challenge for me posing space down just right now for the point where it's gonna be over the net porky should have a free ball and even a 1v1 there but it's okay a little bit of a mistake a little bit of panic that happens sometimes we almost got one back i thought he was gonna be back at all play it back to porky here hit it around him it's good we should come back right about now hopefully there it is again someone must have missed that boost for that to be that late it doesn't make sense off could go play made support key should be a free shot and a goal nice yeah very very nice so much space in the mid there most people don't cover that in twos even in threes they don't cover it sometimes you have that opportunity you have to look forward and it's going to go every time you kick off well done well done
