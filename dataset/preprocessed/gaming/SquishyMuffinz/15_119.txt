yo what's going to be playing some threes today with gimmick and johnny yet again like i did in a previous video i'm gonna be using dominoes for today i'm trying it out again we'll see if i actually feel good on that see by the end of the video how we feel but let's get into the games let's see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game the dominus tester we're playing against butter saucer kaiser and piatrix yeah this goes i got absolutely the show on the kickoff but that's expected because i'm used to using a much higher car dominus is a absolute pancake a little bit of a mistake there should be fine over one i can follow this up by 40 boost let it kill one got the demo good shot well done well done i'm also trying slightly smaller name plates again like i used to use i used to use this way back um 100 nameplate it's like the default i've been using 150 lately if you guys are wondering why the nameplate's a little bit bigger normally that's what it is go to your um your gameplay settings i believe it is and it's like interface scale something like that i'll show you guys after interface display or nameplate and uh i was using 150 by lower background to 100 like i used to use back in 2017 i'm testing it out i might be back she should be there fine i actually went for this should be okay though i took my time on that not a bad thing to take your time on you gotta wait a second here put a potential shot gotta pass it back close a little bit too far on the pass back i'm gonna leave that mid boost let me show you behind you instead let them touch that it should be fine better play it around them let me go for a bump here before i go back i think a kill would be big wait a second play it back here play mid good speed shot with them it's a good play there nice little soft touch middle really good speed there to get it off the back wall and then a good shot as well follow that up okay left side left side pass would have been really good but it's also kind of hard for him to get it perfectly wait left side here he wants to pass again can't really go so i shouldn't even have moved up to be honest the past was like it was a good idea but if i'm not like extremely close there then it's not like something i can score i think it was just not as fast as he would have wanted but it was a right idea i think would have been a goal if it was executed perfectly it's a good demo on one my first touch here no one he actually stole he actually got the touch on that it's kind of insane i went for the absolute banger of a shot on that i'm gonna tell johnny the fake maybe he's ready oh never mind i don't think they're ready for it it was it should have been me telling gimmick to fake not johnny but i might still be fine here i could pop this middle close got the mid left boost here can actually reach this might be a goal we got back it's fine if the mid boosters are all the back boots i should say that's right uh it's probably going to be a goal actually had a good line on the double there i think all the way back maybe touch back here that's fine if he beats me i got the demo on one gotta bump the other play it across to me maybe not gonna go for this he has a block on that play it across again it's fine that'll do got it out of danger should be able to be there first i sit back kinda don't wanna play that forward wow i was actually almost crazy i was just a little bit would have been closer there we go nice little cross map play there good job from get me to be underneath it as i always feel super nice on dominus feels like you have a lot of control over the little touches in the air yeah good first game let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs dominance felt nice but we could have definitely done better so let's get to the next one see if we can play better and finish off with another dub see how it goes my game was all tab we're back we're back all right we got creamy tosses and spoon i am dead i was all tabbed the queue was taking a while save hit it around me i'm gonna call it all the way for their boost here i think it's worth you can get a big flip over all the way back here good kill let me touch that oh actually i plucked him i think i was trying to go for the boost taking all the boost it's fine don't mind that it's actually going to be a really good position for us that's a goal yeah i don't mind a situation i feel like the bump he goes for there just takes him really far to play always going to be putting us in a good position as a team and a good spot to score me go back left here say my boost off the bat my first touch should have this nice off you're left side he has no boost here so i'm gonna wait a little bit closer than i normally would there we go try to play off a good spot to follow up the 50 50. that's the best spot we probably could have been in to be honest gonna go there divine it's a decent block could have went for a should have passed there probably would have been a good play but not too big of a deal i don't doesn't end up too bad for us gimmick should have this off back wall putting in the goal here going back down the ground someone's gonna be back ball should be able to clean it up i can go to the boost now let me go for the bump here make a situation awkward play it down the middle now of course i panicked from two of them which is good and i have a boost should be fine playing this far he can't get a good hit he has kind of carried up the wall again drive up make him jump make him waste all of his boost because it's actually in a really good spot for our team to make something out of it should be a follow-up touch another follow-up touch unlucky that should be fine let me go for this here worst case scenario it gets over both of us but even then it's not going to be a goal it's not going to be enough i'll focus here back the blocks better block them again i still have 60 views so i want to hold on to that a lot of good back-to-back touches from them to be honest but we get out well they don't have much of a play going forward at all now for the next little bit might even get to go out of this potentially get safe from him where's the recovery there we got the boost go for the double no it's actually so close almost the the slightest little touch there hit the double on that if i play it down to the corner one of my teammates just went back for a little bit i can wait middle so it's a good spot i mean i don't want to go for that though that becomes a little bit risky my first control there's no option but to go right here i'm gonna sit here single jump 50 again no boost i got bumps they make one the ball really hard should be a goal maybe i could score it no i went for the the flip reset man off the back wall not used to getting down the dominance on the octane i probably had that to be honest around one i'm gonna pre-jump this i didn't hit it right if you had to hit right i had it read so i put on him to realize that i was going for the read there give you a bump here of course i hit it away at the very least right left close to your play there think all the way back my first touch nice room pretty good spot for i gotta hit here let me go for a bump with the last guy back this bump is actually crucial to get you can find a kill like this normally opens up a lot of opportunity for the next couple of hits so looking for the third man on bumps like that is pretty much the best bump you can get i'd say right here's another good chance to go for a bump in this guy you bump them and the situation is normally again they have to risk an instant jump on a touch they probably don't want to get almost always ends up really well for us but yeah today i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time that you guys are watching this i'm going to try some more games out with a dominus and see if i like it but hope you guys enjoyed gotta get to grinding some more for the rlcs championships coming up next week love you guys and i'll see you guys on the next one peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
