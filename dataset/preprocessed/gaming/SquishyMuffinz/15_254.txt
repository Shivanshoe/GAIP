hundred thousand subscribers now which is just nuts to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo what is up guys do be running some threes today with gimmick and wonder mic if you guys are unaware one of my is he's currently getting a tryout with torment and gimmick he's an up-and-coming all the rest player so they're giving him a shot and yeah it's not necessarily their official 3rd I don't think but but he's been playing in tournaments with them and yeah he's one of the one of the options I believe so what are we playing some threes today with these two should be some good games good fade into it let's see how it goes I have the first thing I'm playing against false FTM here and changing Jesus so this goes I don't recognize one of them the JJ guy the other guys I do you recognize so we'll see how this goes I don't see me tough math on this game pretty quick so see I'm not gonna go for that I don't go first nice way behind let's try the double I got this now hit it across this is a good attempt on the pass good try again that one to go I'll you launched me out could be a hair drill play all fine get killed little bit perfect should have it nice from where I'm guessing there we go does the uplifting gimmick I trusted I'm fully they have the second touch there's no reason not to they're really a few misses that I know I'm gonna have another two minute back anyway so would have been fine regardless so therefore this so just flip for it [ __ ] I passed forward almost [ __ ] on our net put it down lucky it's actually really good for us see what happens to you gimmicks up really early I'm gonna wait I had to wait again for this next touch I just gotta run one to the right here got to be careful there touches that's the gimmick Oh smoo you're back now you should have that oh nice save I think it by I want to see it started moving out to really off the wall I see make a really reach for all of them so always in your boots now and we should eventually got to go out of this if they get a bad touch you it's pretty much all rely on this touch from them nice leave everything go soon the pressure we have right now we're bound to the plane reactionary off all of our touches so one way or another is gonna eventually going there we go it's gotta keep going keep applying that pressure don't stop and it will just go straight in that's the whole the whole point of threes is using your team to just slowly break down the other team make them I sell their boost and eventually you get to go out of that which is how it works you don't want to first force your plate too early most of time it's not gonna pay off you know there are a few few times where you just go for a quick play by yourself and it'll work but most of times you force a shot too early or you try to like do something too quick without really taking time to break down the opponent then you're not gonna ever get anything going and you to feel like you're just stuck you just start doing absolutely nothing so you try to break down pressure when you can like you I have to go for this I got two of them go I'm gonna go for it again there's really no no reason for me not to and I can get a free shot I missed I think but it was still a good attempt and ended up getting us a goal so they're my patients just lets you you know then throwing the ball right to me which eventually led to pretty much a free and also I'm not sure if I want to finish mean or not I've been on thetic for like what we can have two weeks now pretty much want to turnin me on it I was feeling good on it but I don't know I've been very entertaining about what I want terms of cars oh I'm trying to actually do me better and I boost was really bad for me this time the jump nice run on my back here and that's the thing too when you're on when you're on defense you got to try your best to to not get beat easy like I got beat super easy to there I should have died honestly like I tried to kill me but when I'm defense yeah I try to do the opposite are we doing an offense right so just trying to waste your boost trying to get beat super easily and you know try to just keep out as many opportunities as possible and if you find that you're banging the ball to them over and over again then you just kind of control it like give me go close on the 50 that's two of them they're not just go I beat two of them with that touch so it's gonna be huge bigger win this next this next battle in the air nice just really good for us though I'll just go again I'm near my teammates are here yet so just make it weird for them make them get another bad touch out you tried to pass on a bad idea it's on a block close some a lot of pressure oh forget the bump we're gonna go was a good try like you should always try to turn it mid field boost if you can if it's there obviously that's like one of the best things you could possibly do when you have a lot of pressure going forward I should really just be like you go for a touch you read sit around and try to make it as awkward as possible and then you just try to get that mid boost and turn keep repeating with your team everyone's working together like they should be then that should be working pretty well trying to keep it in keep pressure that's fun team it should have another missing miss okay we always have a backup guy back he makes me jumping off the ceiling nice good patience to slow it down and you got two out of the play from that like I put his back right hopefully I wanna see that you do that nice go for that top the back wall make it really weird for them good patience he left himself in a spot where you can't get back even if it was over his head it's what you should do there leave yourself both options nice alright good first game came to the next one sleeping to keep it up that was really solid though I'm just I'm just messing with my camera settings right now that's the main thing I'm messing with a lot but I've been pretty confident fennec I don't know my main thing is cameras Ted he's trying to figure what I want to use for that but anyway let's get to the next one Stephen keep it up and it goes again for last see I'm putting in Joshua Squasher and pure LT as well as titanium I always think when people that L of T in their name that it's um like part of their game for whatever reason like actually part of his name I read it as like pure lft instead of just pure for whatever reason I don't know why I do that I still do it after playing so many people that have that in their name we're so long next guy could be a much better touched yet better controlling that but it's fun you make sure plug it over one's gonna be terrible though cuz I didn't let me get spot for it yeah if you it feels like back in coal you don't have momentum to get there but kiddo just kept going alone or fifty did or something right side you're gonna be there just gonna fall save my boost grabbed a home here nice my kills gotta be good I couldn't kill any of them they all kind of missed not chem exceeded did the classic it's okay I think I feel like they're trying to steal it and just say they shot that see the placement oh ho silly all right all good regain what better way to regain the top quarter pit never mind I thought it was gonna be in top corner pinche Rooskies I'm sad I'm sad that they did go in we're gonna get a Content what are these guys doing I'm confused we can come back I believe just got a regain three minutes a lot of time that's like 10 years rocket League minutes raka big time wait what what am I saying yet I mean three minutes like 10 years in this game god I don't know what I'm saying this game I'm losing it then you take a mini break after this probably alright if he gets the beat here perfect alright we can make some out of this that's the gimmick if patience you should be buying shot like it's not the backward probably best bet here we go good play well done well done there's no point in me trying to shoot that I'm never at that angle never have a speed on that shot so I might as well make it suitable for a teammate best possible way to get that into their net is to try to pass that I trust gimmick you you know he's really awkward out here for this one now try to block nice you control it 50 that's fine should go up bad shot you could probably take this I'll go behind him try to follow up in KC misses I bumped up I feel a little more awkward now but I still have it there we go I'm gonna go back now not something I should stay on I don't have any more boost to follow that up I seem able to fly you have more boost coming in on it they can make a better place and I can with none obviously give you why it's fun I just go the other way I should have liked it there off the wall for gimmick I'm not a very good 50 but it's fun you could probably get there I didn't want to pass that back honestly I wasn't sure the best way to pass that back would be nice you could probably get this I'll be behind him if he doesn't nice dunks I got bumped that's worse than it should be back I like that from giving not bad well I'll see you living if you have passes perfect they try it I'm gonna wait behind I play to my teammates I'd close on the pinch attempt close you should go quick on this nice there's just no boost anywhere oh this is it I've seen them do it yeah it is the slowest those little flick but it works slowest little thing Bank take back what nicely done try to kill them I couldn't it's fun to be wide nice you could probably go you touch probably finish nice you three may play what done what that I like not to jump on those just because I came out positioning right like if I Drive it through that ball gimme could follow it up it gets past middle I can be there if I flip into that I'm still hanging in there wall outside giving passes that so I just say give him some sort of option there anyway three off today's video guys hope you enjoy it heavy sup wonderful day or night with retirement watching his like comment subscribe and I see you guys on the next I
