yo what is up guys going to be playing some games today with ajax and gimmick i played with them in a previous video but this is a completely different day it's going to be playing different players but yeah let's get into the games for today should be some good ones let's get into it let's see how it goes all right first game playing against uh league slubby and linear we'll see late night 3v3 is always um interesting to say at least so let's see as of all pinches 100 miles per hour into my net somehow i'm getting strategy for it of course took all their boosts get touches from gimmick messing up pretty good you guys can get that nice should be fine i'm gonna hold on to my boost here it's fine i don't need to really panic for these balls it's not like they have an immediate shot any of them really i pass oh my gosh almost worked the freestyle okay give me coming in trolling full speed into my butt try to pop it up supposed to get past the game but i don't think he had enough boost for it that's what it probably went yeah i should have nice over one it's not a whole job there pretty much to get over that first guy it doesn't need to be a goal or anything you don't need to try to always go for the net you just gotta try to break down your opponent slowly that's my whole whole goal there get it over one guy it's gonna help my team eventually break out it's fine a little bit awkward these touches but we'll get something here in a second i believe play forward one of them jumped which is good it's gonna be a bad touch from them should be a goal there we go kind of forcing them to make the mistake by just tossing it high i'm gonna cheat on this you should always see it for the middle on this kickoff because if it does slowly die you can get it if not let them get that wall hit your teammate should have that should be past the gimmick should be a goal close leo for ajax didn't bounce how i thought it would i can go all the way back here they'll probably have a touch over to me so it's gonna be easy to hit back ajax up for this i shouldn't be here probably and the whole situation was made so much more confusing because i left it for him and i should have just done what i was going to do gimmick trolling as usual as per usual nothing new it's the same old gimmick i'm not gonna go for this quite yet i'll just wait it's fine right to the side it's normal downside just being really patient there it spell like that better one again played over two actually it's gonna be a pass over to gimmick should be a goal close he missed the setup on the play was good i think it should be a goal maybe of course it wasn't quite close enough to get the the clean up there but it was a right idea let me slow down that play maybe i should go unless he's gonna play right side that's fine give me cast pretty easily ajax should be open a shot looking for each other pretty well that's a really good shot that's a tough one to get you to back up all the way and then get a powerful shot to the corner oh give me a pump you can dude let me see more team bumps enemy bumps what is this he's trolling me man marry for the pinch here potential of the pinch the ajax stick that's fine there's more metal coming on that it's not a bad thing to do it all day it around him that's fine the fake works too keeps his position so i pass i kind of messed that up might be good for us oh i got it over the second guy it's probably a goal for us honestly but a little bit greedy i should have just flicked it instantly oh i'm in a really bad spot now though god of it somehow but definitely more dangerous than i needed to be i'll just leave hey i should go first you get the message that went behind him let's find a decent block oh my god that's so sketchy you almost own gold just bang the top corner i like the pre-jump plays should i make my touches around them that's fine i'll take spawn and back on 30 boosts my teammates are both free jumping best case scenario honestly should be a goal there we go all right good first game pretty solid stuff let's get to the next one so you can keep it up it's probably the exact same people just because pretty late at night right now just been chilling so most likely to be running into them it was a pretty quick queue let's queue it up again see if we can get the same guys it's even cute with the good stuff see you guys all right running to dab abdul and abood i don't know i want to go kind of trolling but it's fine we regain yeah i hope we can get the two back-to-backs here i control this glad you make trusted me on that good 50 oh the pass we take those for sure hundred percent we take down it was a good idea to control on the wall there i know both my teammates were stuck in their net trying to kill time for them in that spot that was a good idea for sure i banged that way too fast it's not bad try to shoot nice good patience from ajax is really good he still has to make the good touches here but oh i was gonna do some depth that was really good patience though from ajax regardless of the second touch that's probably not what he wanted it was really good slowed it down killed time for both of us to get back and the only downside didn't get the 50 on the last touch everything up to the last touch was perfect good block i'm gonna hit that again it's fine i just can get it it's over me your control double close dapper is obviously like he's pro player he's never going to miss those those reasons if he does extremely rare you can't just bank on them missing that has to be a really tough hit for them to make come to even come close to missing something like that oh the reed mad close let me go for the boost over one tried to bump the other it's a good idea giving her for the double was also really good good try from him there's another flip so i just keep going for flip resets classic in a any ranked man oh the double man i felt that i felt it was right there it was a good read got to take out the wall probably oh we're getting so close to scoring man they're just everywhere they're all over it from let him take it good touch forward off back wall should be good for him i think it shows up the wall would be good oh so unfortunate i was so close to getting the touch i wanted so close nice good reaction there how's it going dribble there's not much i could do the position i was in as soon as i get over gimmicks head it's a little bit too late and i don't have much of a way to challenge it though that's fine two minutes left he's got to capitalize on when we have opportunities we're making more opportunities than they are for sure kind of just relying on solo plays so we're bound to to get a goal here pretty soon i think we just keep playing how we have been i think we have been playing as a better team oh so close again man they're stopping the shots that are about to be in like one second before they happen every time it's fun pass over to ajax what is this pre-jump it almost worked too just made it really weird for me though jimmy's probably just messing around but it's kind of working a little bit i mean it's creating it's creating chances just forcing me to play a little bit more patient that's all you almost pre jump double tap that like super far in advance got the equalizer though it's pretty good good position to be in like i said we've been on the attack this whole game it feels like i was actually in as well they just keep on saving my shots they're all over it wait for the flick let me give it a challenge off the ceiling i was good to beat him it's going to make us have the advantage here we have to play off our touches now over and over again for a while should be really awkward for him but again he's not going to miss those you're very rarely see a pro player miss that kind of touch try to beat him to that got the bomb it'd be from gimmick that was good just hit it around now we still have pressure here they're going to be open for overtime because we're really close to getting that goal that's something unfortunate the timing on me going for the beast the floater yeah they'll definitely take ot here because they're in a really rough spot give that like five to ten more seconds you're probably gonna go he's trying to force his touch it's fun doesn't he be anything too crazy as long as it makes him get a hit that he's probably not happy with getting the bumps on dab that was good good block ajax has to get hit here though try to bump one no one's going for the ball what is this i've never seen this should be good enough of a pinch they can't really shoot off of it take my time here just wait on back wall nice left side i made all of them jump this is huge there we go i got all them off the ground baited them all in for that it's got a good 50 i want straight middle all right pretty good stuff weird games honestly but that's what you're gonna get this late at night it's 4am right now and i feel really tired so sorry if the commentary wasn't as good as i would like it to be hope you guys have a wonderful day or a night with the timers when you're watching this like
