yo what's up guys we've been trying to go for the top 100 spot in 2v2 we're almost there so we're going to try to secure that we've already secured the top 50 spot in 1v1 top 60 spot when we went actually from last season apparently all the mmr did for 1v1 was just take away 80 or something like that so someone in my twitch chat told me so uh we're finished off at like 16 something last season then we're at 1540 something right now in our ones mmr so we're already already top hundred and ones which is good we have to worry about that we're gonna go for top 100 in twos for today we are at 17 20 and we need to get the 1751. i don't know if we're gonna get enough points we're gonna be really close for sure um and then we're really close in threes as well uh we got placed in at gc3 and uh we're at 1780 right now so we're 30 points off of it in threes as well so pretty close in all game modes let's get into it let's even get some dubs see if we can finish off in top 100 for today all right we got ourselves tricky against lope and heck i recognize heck he's pretty decent i'm not sure anyone else is this lobby but we will see not sure what to expect out of this i play close here decent challenge and didn't waste any boost as well which is really good you wanna try not to necessarily waste boosts on challenges like that for sure just gonna play patient here teammates should go for me might be fast enough to be in i think i took a good timing on the shot i did good job to save booster we're able to get so much power in that shot and be ready for it because we saved all of our boots on two challenges right that was well played on that part trying to maintain our resources for when we needed them i think it's back boost here it's a right idea trying to pass back hoping my teammate wins that it should could have should have challenged that i like that he took it patient though not a bad idea either either or is fine as long as he doesn't get stuck in the middle if he plays the patient and then like kind of like half commit to the challenge that's when that gets bad oh unfortunately i got bumped a a challenge maybe it's in oh should say from them you must take his time here you shouldn't try to force a play don't need to rush it that's fine i prefer when like take a lot of little touches on those balls because you can get a lot more done with a small first touch than just banging it away right i think when people just have a lot of time they tend to want to hit hard fast away from them as fast as possible i think that's not always the greatest idea but there are some times when it's good letting him challenge for me i don't want to commit with him right be patient on this for the shadow of the place though full boost again just saving my boost that when i needed i could take a shot could have actually been on target it was a very hard shot to get but try to be a nuisance for my teammate should go now nicely done or some really wide there so my team didn't have much of an angle that to deal with at the end so you want to be helping your your teammate as a defender there one more touch over them try to take the other boost it's fine if i get demo i'll be back for 30. trying to play smart on the challenge did i like it it should go again for me though yeah good timing on that and jump to the wall here better play page on this again i don't want to commit right i didn't have to commit there and actually force two bad touches out of them and now there's only one guy on offense a fake touch here down to the ground i need to hit that away there's no point too so i'm gonna jump to the wall try to control it my teammate take it it's fine there okay for this touch and last for a little bit so i'll try to play this to myself there you go no boost but it should be behind me he's gonna have full boost as well i'm gonna trust him for a second grab the mid boost here we're gonna have a free solo play here i think how to fake the high let it bounce always works always works in situations i swear i'll just go back here now i want to be back in support just because timmy gets beat he did well there first touch light to myself try to get a double here maybe i could try you can really be their middle good of him to play a little bit further back there it's not bad at all i'm glad to get out of that that's a very tough situation to be honest i have to pick the perfect time to challenge that let him stay on that it's pretty awkward now though yeah that's right that's really unfortunate to be honest i don't think my teammate needed to touch that in the corner like he it was safely into the corner i would have the free dribble and he kind of just like hit it up maybe he was able to fall to himself but then he got dunked pretty hard which left me in a bad spot so i know a lot went wrong there to be honest it could have been fine uh i think it was just a mistake in a few areas but also unlucky that he loses the challenge so hard there should be okay on my teammate bump the last guy back he's hoping that'd be a demo because it'd probably be open but it was just a shy of one i think nobody doesn't have a flip there it's my green light to challenge that teammate should go now should be back to challenges it's okay take my time on this we have 40 seconds left we're all tied up no reason to panic for anything i'm gonna get bumped here fortunate that i get spun out there i think i'd rather get demo to get spun out right there for being behind my teammate then to be um spun out like that i'm like not really of use for a bit should be okay hold on try to keep creeping on the right side here full boost teammate can actually pass this wall when it's this game nicely done good job to go for the pass there now you need to do anything crazy at all again i just need to not miss right i took my time i'm not gonna flip into that i'm not gonna do anything too quick we have seven seconds to get that goal and that guy's going for a bump on me right there on kickoff so i just gotta dodge that and we'll win the game got to be careful on this now i'm going to pick challenge early got to make him have to jump right he wants to stay on that now he has to air dribble that all the way down and he's going to run out of boost it's not going to have much of an option so try to force that play as early as possible that's why i pushed early but i didn't commit right so i'm still saving my position and forcing his player which is the best move to make there oh yeah good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes oh he's queuing with a friend maybe friend of the smurf i'm not sure but that guy was equally as good as him i'd say so that's surprising but let's get into the next game it's even keep it up so many points you got from that as well actually i just want to see that real quick uh i think that was 10 points i want to say that was 10 points doesn't really tell you i wish i told you i could use back and smart but i'm always so lazy all right 1730 we need 21 more points i don't know if i'll get in this video but we'll be close gets next game all right sweaty game here we got tricky from last game against candy and azura everyone in here is pretty solid try to get the that perfect like 45 degree flick that goes like top bins but i couldn't quite get help there on the challenge i would have been probably screwed to be honest because i was getting bumped it can be over we should have nice i had to block one of the angles there at the challenge somewhere early unless you're kind of screwed it's a good pinch snap touch it across i'll just leave it put them in boost teammates should go now good touch if i play topless to myself there i can go for this again stay grounded hopefully lose the boost for me he does i had to pass it timing was there which is really good of him be ready let's see if i can get her over that one pre-jumping defender take my time on this like for a good first touch got the boost here which is good like that touch put over one don't have enough boost to get power on the last touch but i think i could put a move around the first guy i was going for the challenge i'm gonna stay on this unfortunately i'm gonna go back now let's get back as quick as possible off that bumper teammate can have a free challenge off that which is good it helped my teammate this game on the the challenges he didn't really good job challenging at the right times or is making my my job a lot easier because he's doing a good job of challenging i'll just be annoying here i'm not gonna even go for this i just want to hit it away this gets a little bit awkward but it should be okay all right teammates shouldn't go i don't think actually it's fine defender didn't challenge so it's actually going to be good the reason why i was thinking he shouldn't go is if the defender insta jumps for this he beats him every time but he was in an awkward spot so let's get my teammate just be ready he was in a spot where if the defender didn't go he could go which is the best play to make right you're covering both options he played a patient at first he didn't insta jump just smart make the mid boost here she better touch this oh don't want to follow this he's soul playing it so it's not good to double commit ever when someone a plane that's a big mistake that a lot of people make every teammate solo playing something just let them don't double commit with them i use any boost and again won that 50. that's good almost bad honestly i don't know how i got dunked so hard there i tried to hit it around him specifically and i i got back pretty bad do a challenge wait back wall again here it's probably a high touch and it was right to the side got the bump on him which is i think it's good enough he should be back in time we should come back in a sec try to take that remember the timing on it take my time good first touch here you can actually work with this quite well the vehicle let's sit down that's good to trap that first touch really close to yourself you have a lot more options when you get that first touch so close i was able to get a good 50 on it choose where i wanted 50 to go as well which is a very very valuable thing in that situation ah tough spot to be in if you're him there obviously you have to try to block the high if i'm him what i normally do is just go for the ball i just try to challenge the ball straight up i don't try to go for the reed because i don't know if you go for the reason you get fake you know you have fake it for feels like no reason but if you go for the ball at least you're blocking the ball for sure you 100 have one thing right the ball covers a lot more options than just the one fake that you're trying to cover that's why i think going for the balls better in that situation but also hindsight's 20 20 a lot easier said than done so not a terrible play for my teammate it was a good play from them i'd say good job good finish well done well done we get 50 there as well just left it for my teammate after that and he was able to get a really good click i played but yeah if you're in the number one situation i'd say almost always play the ball playing the fake is gonna be uh like playing the the reed on the ball is almost always bad i think because it gives them a lot more power i think if you just play the ball you're covering the most deadly thing a lot of options in it right blocking higher covering one of many options the best way to explain my thoughts on that i think it's pretty pretty obvious why it'd be better try to force him into a bad spot there just threw it away anything i was talking about last game he had a little bit of time on that he could actually make a much better play i think but like right here instead of me throwing this away i'm just trying to take it slow i put him in a lot more of a pressure situation and now we end up getting the ball back in the situation most likely because of that maybe even a goal out of it i'll play from him teammates should be able to challenge try to control this try to trap this somehow it's like not gonna be enough to win though but i'll play from them all right hope you guys enjoyed today's video another good set of games i think that should be another like 10 points probably because these guys are probably pretty high up let's see what we get from that let's take a look there we go nine more points from that so you can see how quickly we're gaining points if we keep solo queueing and winning a bunch of games we'll get to top 100 in no time like two more games we'll get it and after that top 10 is not that far away either it's like 1850 i think so not too shabby at all hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace you
