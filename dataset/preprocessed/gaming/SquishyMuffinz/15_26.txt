yo what's up guys we're back with some more games with ryze it should be some good ones it's a lot of fun last video so let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game of video we got ourselves 808 who's played in the rival series not sure that it and scribbles yeah this goes pretty good kickoff to start almost a shot as well gotta kill them on the way back here it's gonna just eliminate any threat of like any past middle we should come back didn't come back in time so unfortunately but it goes straight to rise just good going for some crazy freestyle or something like every time he messes up the flippy set always works though ends up working somehow set up the wall and just wait whatever he has here if it's high it's going to be my job if it's slow let me rise i went for the first high touch now it becomes awkward that's fine let him stay on that it's fun took my time here beat one which is good can't actually beat the second but at least got a 50 on them i can go for a bump on one now bump two close first bump didn't do enough to him i would have been a goal but it's a good attempt actually get touched around me i need ceiling here trying to play in a weird spot for him gonna make the control a little bit awkward which means should be okay for ryze to deal with should be 1v1 now oh it's my vehicle i don't think i could do much nice i just trusted that i wasn't in it's all you could do there faster eyes nice they went all in for that i feel like if the guy going for the corner he didn't go so fast here like just took his time it was going to be a goal because i had to dodge the bump and get the save which is really difficult there because rise is out of the play for a long time oh my bad i don't know i i shouldn't have went for that because that was the first challenge regardless let's say from him i'm gonna hit that it's fine it should be showing my teammate as well this might be a goal wow i didn't expect him to miss i think he could have had it but he had to expect the mystery which is like i don't know the balls are in front of the net it's very very hard to just be ready for miss pass right here probably won't expect it i think ryze wasn't close enough for it though but it was the right play if he was a little bit closer as a goal for sure especially in three years i think ryze would would not be as afraid to be middle for that a shot good fakes nice that's so threatening there the pass that i gave him especially he has so much time to make a shot you shoot here shoot again right here if you want to like hit so many options and that first touch was so good that i gave him even more options on top of that it's really hard for the opponent to be ready to do anything to that honestly unfortunate didn't get the boost let's try to go for him take some pads here i'm not going to use any boost here because most of most likely he's trying to bait me in i'm not going to get baited i'm just going to bait the first touch and leave there we go that's a goal off of that all i have to do let me just drive up make him make this hit and he's going to think i'm close to that point and then just leave and i was already out of there before he even made the second touch i knew that was what was going to happen i knew no matter what that ball was going straight to rise that's going to be a very good position for us to be in good first match sales against the next one so you can keep it up always clean stuff i'm having a lot of fun playing the rides against the next game see ya guys i got chief beef i don't know why i find that name funny and the hitos our new newest challengers i keep up here say my boos don't want to commit on this because i'm still last for a while as soon as ryze can help me out it's better to actually make a play on this my bad we faked each other out that's unfortunate we're trying to be too too good of teammates to each other that we both faked each other out funny like i feel like higher ranks the better the players get the more that happens but the lower ranks just everyone going for every ball it's like the opposite problem just as bad but just find it funny really a password right it's good vision there should be okay nice is the 1v1 here good 50. i missed the bounce gonna make this a little bit awkward here that's control really good double it's gonna start at least a little bit time for me and i can go for him now to force him high should be okay pass off to rise on the wall prefer a chance to dribble this close i got over the first guy which is good there it gets a good amount of pressure and force them to use their resources as well which is really good it's fine forces wide to rise we have all the pressure here like every every touch they're making is is mainly getting reacted to what they even better hit from us so i feel like they don't have any kind of like threat coming out of anything they're actually producing here which is good we still have the advantage in all these players i'd say down to the ground here control this maybe a pinch it's a good try like we're you feel like we're winning every 50 i think that's like a good um showcase of like who has more pressure you're winning the 50s and getting the next touch after it every time and you still have the boost control that's like the main thing for trying to keep pressure making sure you have boost control after all your challenges actually get a pair of hits from him that's good and that's the danger of intubity when you have too much pressure and you have like good situations they had one like literally a touches that are actually good out of defense and they're able to get it go out of it because you can start to like over commit and it's a lot easier to play defense to play offense i think so being on defense actually preferred i'd say especially like this but i feel like offense didn't take all that much skill a lot of just trying to go for bumps trying to go for solo plays which isn't that difficult to do over and over again threes you need a lot more teamwork definitely get away with uh that kind of stuff like being overly pressured like that wow no comment no comment on what i would have witnessed incredible that's happened in three sometimes though you're like your team will have the pressure for like two three minutes they'll get one counter attack and they'll score off of it like that happens a lot actually but it happens much more in uh and twos in a dozen threes for sure i can't believe i won that ball i'm not gonna lie should be a goal as well could not have been able to win that it's very awkward for me but i had a really good read good aerial too those are the most important things on defense you can read those like you're gonna get your team so many goals for free especially in twos because people just commit so hard wow killed the third as well am i let him try to shoot this go for the dribble kind of beat him here i heard him jump one of them for a bump so i kind of just stayed there in the same spot menacingly a lot of time on the dribble now nice it's a good play to make i have a lot of options here i can air dribble bump go for a flick just try to just fake it and just in one spot i think the low 50 is always the best option there just because if it dies in front of the net your teammate also just has a free shot up off of it like to make ryze is really good at coming time and just forcing like opponent wide it's like a non-threatening space which is really good it's really hard thing to to get in the habit of doing especially when your last man a lot of people like this instachallenge should really uh really good thing that he does very often i put this into [Music] open space here played around them at least delay as much time as possible for us to get in a favorable position let's try to jump for him for some high and then just hope for the best that's all i can do where's the high hope for the best dude that's not rising that back wall it's that's tough rusting high is good there because the backhoe guy should have an easy challenge on that but if you're not back off your ground or any form of being not back well it's very hard to deal with that as honestly just like a bunch of bad situations leading up to that moment there a lot of double commits from us but it's okay gotta get kickoff goal to secure which i pass over to him not the strongest pass but we attempted that's what matters all good all right it's into the next game hopefully we can get another dove here getting ready incredible players we're crazy man we're too good against the next game let's even keep it up back back back ups again after the last game we got 808 and fly cool all righty i need boost i'm gonna try to get back right for him the touch i'll be middle as well if he wants to the cross i'm just gonna fake this i have some time here try to use it let it bounce off the wall good hit it's gonna be awkward for him now honestly okay the shot is so tempting there because i know i can score it but i feel like it's not even worth it i feel like i should have something to hit around i don't know because there's a world where that guy that challenged me back while i was late and i get a free goal but more valuable probably to either wait around or to hit it around that guy into rise direction like shot is always gonna be blocked at least gonna try to block it so i might give them what they want by going for a shot there not bad but i'm actually work i'm staying middle force the flick at least by flipping there which is good i might get beat here i'm gonna pop it can't really shoot well off of that so i was just trying to like anything that would be awkward for him to deal with get the mid boost here on my left side full boost as well so if he wants to pass me good time to do so you should just beat him might be a goal against yeah i don't know what i expected to come of a two-man pre-jump play in twos and the past was like it was too low as well so honestly as soon as i saw that i was gonna be a little like that i shouldn't have went but we're recording you know we might as well go for some content might as well have some fun with it why not that's gonna happen in high-level lobbies if you mess around like that and you get scored on and get punished for it it's good first one out brothers can make a good play on this actually pretty awkward for him he might get killed as well barely got back to that good dribble oh it's just gonna try to keep it soon and how about going for a goal there just trying to make it like really awkward for him to get a good touch i don't even know what just happened i kind of want to watch it though i'm a good job good double nicely done i'm gonna roll up the wall and just leave it i'm gonna make it weird for him i think ryan's got the bespot on me so hopefully he can challenge i should be fine back well i can kill his kindly back to be big he's gonna turn fun cover what we needed to it's trying to be as annoying as possible it's not giving them the money for irrigables or anything that they can actually get like threatening space out of should be a touch at least oh my god i thought he would have it i'm not gonna lie tried to read him that always works too i feel like when someone misses like that let's show me i would expect everyone to like everything perfectly nice perfectly done good positioning from ryze good to give me that option but a lot of people don't even try to give the option middle they're kind of scared to push up unfortunately good uh good cheap from them as well it's like a hard cheat price turned away early but it's it's hard he's also on european thing 132 is a really bad server for him so that might have went to the left for him kick off it's not going to go for this he's stuck in their net so i was trying to wait let's touch here kind of bump him be annoying hit it around them try to keep possession any way possible also not wasting too much are my resources put it over all of them should really get play there good control the preset attempts probably left side here i feel like it can pass this it'd be like takes this time but i'm just gonna wait play back with this there for a bump on him nice it's a good shot actually like a much tougher shot than it looks like in the corner but it's one that i practice so much i can get every time but it's actually like so much harder than it looks i'm i used to miss them a lot i made like a a training pack i just feel super comfortable on this i was gonna bump good job though another good set of games today 30 seconds left two goals but the mess up pretty bad here to lose this like definitely losable but i hope we
