yo what's up guys so as you can tell from the title of today's video we're going to be going over directional arrows so arrow right or arrow left doesn't matter what you want to use it's purely preference so before we even get into the specifics of what you can do with arrow right or left we got to cover which one you're gonna pick and why so first off this is something that gave me a hard time at the start when it first came out when i first got implemented into the game i tried to use a roll left and when i tried to use this for the first time it felt super awkward super uncomfortable and nothing felt right about it and then i realized that every time i'm flipping in game on the ground i flip to the right when i'm doing aerials and stuff i always turn to the right still so what i notice is that arrow right is best for me even though i wanted to use arrow left arrow right would be best for me because of the way i flip my tendencies um the way the aerial bind works is just much better for me on the right side so that's how you can figure that out if you tend to flip more to the left side probably arrow less best for you if you tend to clip more to the right side over right is probably best for you and that'll also help you out i know it's a little bit ahead of things in this tutorial but that'll also help you out if you want to eventually get good at doing stuff like this because if your arrow right and you flip to the right you can just carry on the air dribble because you're already flipping that direction anyway so if you flip to the left you can just carry it on with the arrow left as well so that's a good useful thing about it as well is that you can do those uh air dribbles you always see me doing where i flip and then i'm able to just keep on going because i'm using it all right so what we're going to do now is once you have that picked you got to go over to your bindings you got to go down to where it says arrow right or left and obviously put it on a button i have mine on square i also like to have a my default arrow bind as well on top of that so i have my default arrow bind on l1 as well i'm not always only using arrow right i'm using probably 80 arrow right 20 regular arrow um so you do want to have a default arrow bind still too so i would try to just add this in somewhere if you can so make sure you have a regular arrow bind on whatever button you want and then arrow left or right bind based on your preference or whatever button you want as well so make sure you have one of each because i think it's very useful to be able to use each for different situations because for example why i think this if i'm going for an air roll shot on the right side of the net on the ball to do this that's a regular air roll if i'm doing it on the left side of the net that's regular as well but say i wanted to use arrow right for this which i never do i never use arrow right for these kinds of shots arrowright works on this side sure but then i get onto the other side and how am i going to arrow that direction to get the the shot i want right my arrow right will always bring my car this way it's going to be hard for me to get the exact kind of accurate shot that i can get out of regular air roll so i would definitely recommend regular aero for that kind of stuff but yeah that's pretty much the whole idea of why i have both air rolls and how you pick your own interval we got that stuff out of the way now let's get into actually learning how this thing works so everything i'm going to be showing you guys right here is all for arrow right but if you're using arrow left don't worry because it's just the opposite so you just flipped of everything you see me doing and it's not hard at all it's pretty much only four different ways you can flip like this um so let's start off if you jump and press your arrow right button which for me is square as you can see my card just does a simple barrel roll i'm not pressing my left stick at all and this is just the very basic air roll that you can do with arrow right and i pretty much never ever am just pressing this um without my stick i always press my stick to some extent i always use my stick to some extent i think it's better um so pretty much that's what happens when you just jump press your arrow right so that's not how you should be using this arrow that's not how you should be using this arrow you shouldn't be jumping at balls and just holding the button that shouldn't be what you're doing so now you mess around with the four different types of weight that actually properly uses air roll so you jump hold square and you pull down this time and you'll see that you do a different kind of turn and then you jump hold square and hold left jump hold square hold up don't hold square hold right so square is my button whatever your button is obviously press that button to do it so those are pretty much the five different ways you can air roll with arrow right or arrow left doesn't matter it's the same thing it would just be the opposite directions for arrow left the reason why people use this over normal air rule is because you can move up and down as well as left and right with just one button so you could do twice as much with one button right so you can actually get way more accomplished in the air and just move way more like fluidly pretty much you can see like it looks so much better when people are using air roll right or arrow left you can tell the difference immediately um just the stuff you could do in the air is insane so there is no easy way to practice this but what i would recommend as i would for all mechanics is go into any training pack really it doesn't really matter i haven't picked one out customly for this but i'm going to use walter air dribble for example because it's a good one to get an idea of how to use it a lot of any training pack this is just an example uh walter a dribble is the training pack i'm using right now and you get an idea of when to use each arrow each part of the air roll so remember like i said there is the one to the right one to the top one to the left and one to the bottom so straight off the back guys one thing that i will say is the upward version of arrow right holding up on the left stick is very good for coming off the wall for air dribbles so here's an example of that see how it kind of just stays on my car and i can just keep on going with the ball that's just holding up up and arrow right that's all i did and i was able to get a perfect takeoff off the wall and it was able to just stick on my car that's just up and arrow right right there so you can use that and add a little bit to it obviously you can add a little bit more flair you can do like different things with it you don't need to just hold up um but what i would say is definitely practice just holding up off the air dribbles coming off the wall i'm not trying to square off this one just an example just keep on going and keep holding up and you'll see that you'll get a much better takeoff than you would with default arrow this is an example of default arrow you see how it kind of gets away from me for a little bit and i have to just be really stiff the whole time you have the extra level of movement with arrow right right where you can just kind of like keep the ball in full control and get to wherever you want to get to and that comes from knowing when to use each version of it right that was all arrow right that was all different versions of it will write little adjustments here there but it started with that upward hold of the button so shut off the bat that's the best scenario to use the upward version of this arrow when i'm in the air though i'm actually not holding just up i go back down to the bottom left into this version this is bottom left so it's a mixture of this and also this but it gives you that perfect amount of control over the ball in the air so you're doing that and you're doing a little circles on your stick and that's going to give you the perfect amount of control when you're mid-air dribble so that's what you should be using for mid-air dribble so to start it off you're using up and then mid-air dribble you're using bottom left and going in little circles and you have to get a feel for that you're going in little circles between bottom left over to the right side of your left stick as well it's kind of hard to explain it's something you definitely get a feel for but this is the best i can possibly explain it guys each bit of arrow write is used for specific situations and that's how you use it to the best of its ability you you can't use one exact flip or one exact rotation for every single thing it won't work there's just no way so like i said start off your arrow holding up and then you go down to the bottom once you have control of it and then you can kind of get behind the ball do whatever you want to do when you have control of it but that's those two ways of using those two flips all right so let's cover the other two and straight off the bat i'll say that holding down an arrow right there's very few if any scenarios where this is actually useful i'm not gonna lie there's very few scenarios where i actually just hold down um but i will hold to the right sometimes and the biggest scenario for this is if i'm on the wall and the ball's with me and i want to jump off quick that's what it would look like so what i'm doing with this is i'm popping the ball down i arrow right right side and then i double jump to get myself down to the ground so i'm letting go of my arrow right button for a half second not even maybe less than that and then i'm double jumping down to the floor to get there quicker and that's what it looks like quick time really quick just near the ground can also be used as like a fake type of thing as well but yeah that's pretty much the best way to use that it would be just holding that direction and then you fake jump that's the only way i really use that to be honest um and then we get into the whole idea of how can you use that in the air and there's really no way to use it in the air outside of you notice that your car ends up like this right midway through this flip so what's that good for when your wheels are perfectly upside down like that you notice when you do to the left your wheels are pointing up right that's not that good for you if your wheels are pointing out but if you do it to the right your wheels are looking perfect for a flip reset so that's perfect for flip resets as you can tell because of the way the car is slanted downward a little bit same to the right and there you go look you got a perfect reset and now you have full control of the ball in that situation so that's the best way to go for resets with this air roll so there you go guys we learned how to do the a roll off the wall to have full control of the air dribble then when you have control of the air dribble how to continue moving it left or right which is going bottom left of your stick and then you've done that to the right you can get flippy sets with it or you could do this little dribble fake those are two things that i do with it there's a lot of uses for this arrow guys it's more than just this so don't ever think it's just this one more thing that i could mention is the quote-unquote breezy flick which is pretty much just a modified musty flick um it's a must flick using air rule right or left directional air roll where you do this and then you backflip so all that is i'll break it down when you're learning any mechanic you try to break it down into steps this is the best way to learn anything in this game or anything in any game break it down to the steps make it easy for your brain to understand and then work at it slowly play it by slowly so what we'll do is we're going to jump pull to the left and it will write that's what we're doing to start it off now all you're going to do for this is you stop air rolling halfway as soon as your car is facing you like you're about to flip reset your own face that's what that's how you stop it at right around there as soon as the bottom of your car is facing you stop that rotation right there let go of the button so now you're gonna let go of that button but you're gonna keep on holding to the same direction so you're gonna let go of your arrow right but keep holding the same direction so the bottom of your car goes down like this facing you let go pull down so just keep on practicing that let go of the button and then hold down let go of the button and then hold down so the bottom of your car ends up touching the ground pretty much and then once your car is consistently at that point in that jump you add the backflip into it and you keep on practicing that so now with the ball you do all those things and ends up looking like that it's just a very simple version of it i'm trying to do it as simply as possible arrow right you stop continue without the arrow right and then you just backflip and you just keep on practicing that over and over again and you'll get much more consistent with it you'll get a better understanding of how it works and you'll even be able to do it off the ceiling and off the walls eventually at some point as well so that's how you can use left a roll in another way as well yeah i can go on and on about how to use this and the different little uses for it but it won't feel good to you and it won't feel comfortable until you get into a game and you keep practicing everything that i talked about and there is nothing i could simply say that'll make you better at this it really just comes down to me just explaining the main ways you can actually use this arrow with your stick like left right up down and then the best scenarios for those in-game that's the only thing i can really do to help you guys right there's nothing more beyond that that i can do to help you guys because you have to put the effort in you have to learn how to get a good feel for it because it gets to the point where it's just muscle memory and you'll have a feel for it and you'll know what's best to do in any situation so inside of what i told you guys just go into any training pack once you've tried some of the things i talked about and just hold down your arrow right button when you jump this is kind of unrealistic you shouldn't always do this obviously but just hold down arrow right button and get a feel for how to use it and hit a ball properly with it that's all you should try to do and just get an idea of what you should be doing when you have a chance to hit the ball in the air also has another thing you can use another good tool to help you improve with this really fast probably faster than anything else are these rings maps so it might not look like it but if you just hold arrow right throughout this and try to like get a feel for how to control your car and maneuver them through all these hoops it's very difficult and especially for your first time you probably won't finish if you're using it all right for the first time or arrow left but just go through the map and try to go as quick as you can just folding the arrow right button and just like look at me like everyone all these different directions just like practicing different ways of going in the air full speed with this and you'll just learn really quick if you watch my left stick you'll see all the little movements i'm doing all the little adjustments and there's even times where i'm letting off my arrow rifle a bit sometimes where i'm just like letting it off completely and i'm just chilling so definitely practice with something like this guys that'll help you out a lot i'm not gonna do the whole course right now but that's pretty much all i wanted to cover for this video to be honest guys i'm just gonna fly away into the sunset but so i wanted to cover for this video i wanted you guys to have a better idea of how to control your car with this thing because i know a lot of people especially when i'm streaming ask me about it and i just don't know how to simply answer that question i i there's there's no simple way to answer that question it comes down to like putting so much time and effort into learning the mechanic and even then you know even even i make mistakes with it sometimes like i've never really done these hoops maps are these rings maps with this so i'm not that great at it but in game if i need to do something with the ball with arrowright i can do it every single time and that just comes down to me putting a lot of work and effort into learning it so i'm sure if you guys put the same effort in you'll learn it and if you apply the things that i said in each of those situations i promise you it'll make a lot more sense to you just try to go off the wall air dribbling using the upward version of it where you do that same flip like this to get control of that first touch it's going to help you out so much like an insane amount but yeah guys hope you enjoyed today's video it's going to be all for this one if you guys want to see any tutorials about anything else this is something that i thought i should just make one on because i always get the question but if you guys want to see any other specific tutorials i can get around to whatever if you guys want to see like a rhodo supersonic legend type series or whatever it may be just let me know and i'm down for whatever but uh yeah i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys may be watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all i'm gonna go finish off this this first map peace [Music] how could i trust you when you hurt me
