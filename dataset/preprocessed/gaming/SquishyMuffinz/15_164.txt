video enjoy today's video guys yo what's up guys hope you're playing tuesday today with rebels it should be some good ones it's 5 a.m right now i'm not sure what to expect but hopefully we can get some tubs i was just playing my first game on in a while and we got riddles on our team and i was kind of trolling i was kind of trolling so i decided why not be some funny content late night we ended up losing to these dudes but i invited rebels i said hey let's cue let's run it back some late night some late night where i'm half asleep but let's see let's see if we can catch some dubs half asleep over here first game modded over 12 hours-ish something like that with my last game so it's my second game on i'm about to pop trust i'm about to go off but i was taking a solo play all right well man's bumping both them out the weight i like it air dribble bumps opec and cheat here the back right boost here control the ball in the corner let's keep it in a spot where they kind of have to challenge us here one it's a good play it's kind of forced to make a play i can rotate behind riddles here good bait all you do is block this all right don't need to go for a goal there obviously i'm not going to score off of that from midfield just being the spot where i can block the play there's best case scenario i'd say hit this back let's get in the way anything works there trying to play it over the rental side but not a bad play no matter what didn't get a save out of that for some reason but find out pause the high shot on goal see he does he has to waste boost has to control it to himself it's a good spot to put the ball wait for his touch here on the back wall i got one out of the play by being a little bit patient there's a good try on the shot actually a very fast shot very tough one but in the stop if it was on target it was a little bit over the net so he didn't have to actually stretch to save it or anything but different muscles still 40 boosts as well play it off the riddle side should be a shot close gonna go up gonna have this one so i could just challenge hit it over to the corner good transition game from us looking for each other on the way out very important thing to do especially in three three and two is not as much but in threes looking just for where each other are very underrated skill quick path quick shot good placement i love what it says if it isn't coming to camp played around two of them hit this up to the ceiling go for the bump anything that forces the ball away to my teammate yet again best case scenario there had to go for the bump on him actually worked hit him pretty far out of the play so we like to see good fake from riddles play up the wall here other kind of place to myself but this is not a cross so any kind of 50 will do this keeps pressure and i can grab their other boost that's a matter of not getting out of the play here i know he has no boost so i don't have to panic too hard for this put a ball with her metals that's fun i could have kept dribbling but i noticed he started going toward the ball so i might as well leave you in that situation let him pinch this that's fine again it goes over the red as a matter of what in this situation played it over one trying to force out a bad touch from them being on the wall there they have to worry about the bump as well they're better to be across already but it wasn't but it should be fun maybe a bump for us again that bumps enough to just force him to go a little bit too far forward there and it gives us an advantage in that play save our 40 boost here it's fine yes throw it away free ball for riddles as long as he doesn't mess us up can't quite see now but it should be fine i've had like four or five really clutch saves like really clutch moments so they should probably be scoring off of it and this doesn't give me a save for it i just don't get the save points oh that's a really good play good idea should be behind him full boost here wait for the bounce let's go for the bump on him i guess there's 50m again should be rattles his ball now it's fine daddy scores never mind he sport i said daddy scores off this and he just gets the tightest angle somehow but it's okay late at night 5am 2v2s you never know what you're gonna get and that's a pretty good example of that just never know what you're gonna get clear for a bump here good win from rentals the pass was originally over to him which is a little bit too weak so i think he'd go for it soon as he gets the boost i'll go for this that's gonna be bad now probably but it's okay we end up getting out of it oh the block would have been huge there oh the huge bump for us bumped another one bumped another one oh the play was there i saw the vision nice skip away from reynolds even for the bump got the fake flip reset ended up working out there we go we'll take their second quarter clutch out get to the next one this evening keep it up get back to back dubs in this late night 2v2 session let's see how it goes all right guys we have an issue riddles left because it took us 20 minutes to find a game so now we're going to solo queue trying to play against reynolds and hopefully catch a dub see if we can do this maybe this will work maybe not we'll see if we can actually find a game or not that's the main goal here just finding any game we'll do we got to finish off the video somehow right so we're going to be queueing through the game whether it be against them or not we'll see see how it goes all right for the last game video was dojo against kyrie and austin so we lost riddles same matchup but we lost rattles so we'll see what we can do see if we can end on a dub here give me another tough game for sure i'm gonna bring that away that's fine even if we end one-on-one today honestly i don't mind if we wanted me to lose one i'm gonna be too bad considering the time and how tired i feel right now not gonna lie i should have definitely went to sleep a long time again but it's okay you may start off with a banger of a play the double jump pop still super solid super quality super underrated way to flick when you have full ball control to get shot from them good problem attempt to i think we have the majority of the gold block there even it looked quite dangerous i think it was less dangerous than it looked so here we're just trying to make him get a flick i think if like that earlier than being super close to the net then that's absolutely best case scenario i don't have any boost here he moved out for my touch i don't blame him i thought maybe the guy last back would have challenged me that's why i jumped early there um but yeah if i play a little bit safer it would have been fine either way it's a hard thing for him to expect and be ready for we got the boost there just big enough i'd say good enough in that situation go for the low shot to the bottom corner don't need anything crazy there you're gonna be thinking i'm gonna bang that top corner so as long as you place it in a spot where they're not ready i'm gonna be getting a goal they're gonna be securing one off a really good 50 for my teammate well played missed the boost tiredness might be kicking in a little bit that is extremely unfortunate it somehow hit back off me i don't know how in hindsight i should have been waiting super far back but how can i expect my teammate to get bumped into it making the 50 super weird and giving him an advantage i didn't expect any of that obviously but it's hard to i don't think even the smartest person in the world could have expected that to happen out of that scenario to be fair going to be a goal most likely unless they mess it up pretty badly which i just don't see happening which they did somehow someway had to block the close angle but i didn't end up even having to because they messed up i don't have any boost here get some pads they're messing each other up yet again pass to my teammate close could try on the finish i'm just prejumping this for my teammate again trying to make his life a little easier don't have any boost here but it's fun go for a bump of some sort make the life a little bit more difficult decent touch my teammate play to the left side if you go for a touch like he did there and he jump and he jumps again after the touch he will never beat me to the next ball that's something that i've just learned over time you just can never win that next challenge after you hit it forward into your opponent so i do recommend is if you're hitting a ball like that forward never jump for the fall up maybe go for a bump if you want to but never jump for the immediate follow-up because you'll never win that next ball it's just not possible i should have played to the wall here i did catch him out of position i did have a feeling that would work and that would be the moment to strike and get a go out of that but i wasn't on target there's only a problem with that idea there should be a free ball for my teammate save my 80 boost here get 100 off pads be in a position to go for a play here slow down in the air didn't get a flip out of that so it kind of ruins my whole my whole plan there in that situation a good play for my teammate regardless put the next touch out well i'm gonna try to touch it back to his side can't actually go for a playoff of it so i can just bump the air dribble away good control i can't go for this i'm just going to pressure be in this area make him do something earlier than he wants to gives my teammate a free ball don't need to panic there just show presents and most of the time that'll be enough to scare them into a touch that they don't want it's fine i'm okay with him if he gets a 50 here or he flicks it or something should be off the ceiling into shot potentially i'm gonna keep this to myself i'm gonna end up dunking my teammate but it's okay i'll just go for this again why not didn't actually go my tiredness is definitely kicking in but uh we'll see i just flipping every ball i love it all right let me focus let me focus go for the bump on him go up another one as well force them really far back on their line they're not going to be comfortable in this situation play back to my teammate good b i'll turn here so i'm going to spot to help him out you can get something middle uh super unlucky that we lose that 50 that hard good win for my teammate all right let's be aggressive here if we can try to go for some balls they won't expect us to go for that'll be one of them we could try to follow up this one as well i probably won't expect it go for some bumps here my teammate can keep this in it's big if not has to put a defense out well and he does it'll be dead all right let's focus up here i'm throwing pretty hard not gonna lie it's super late but showing you guys some some bad gameplay i think it's good to switch it up every now and then super try hardy stuff do whatever the hell this is and it's gonna happen when you're when you're sorry not gonna lie and they are playing for the win right if we can catch the dub that's what matters go to the wall here i don't have a flip out of that somehow i was really banking on having a flip that was the whole play was was built off of the foundation of that play you can actually get a touch on the next one there so you just have to wait should be okay you may should have free ball for the left side maybe or for the solo play it's fine not a bad idea should be able to clean this up on the back wall you may should have this most likely nicely done play it down to my teammate should be free goal there we go we actually ended up winning so we'll take it the end of the day you know if you catch the dub you catch the dub there was a very very messy very messy uh set of plays there for a bit very messy two minutes uh but there you go guys there's me playing like complete booty cheeks on no sleep for like 30 hours at 6 a.m and we ended up being two very high little players so we'll definitely take it i can't really complain not gonna lie but yeah obviously you could play a lot better you guys know that i'm just very very very very very tired but yeah see you guys in the next video if you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night but if times you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace you
