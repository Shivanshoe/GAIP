yo what's up guys goodwill playing some tuesdays today with missed as we get to the games i just wanted to say we actually did end up winning the major this weekend which is crazy it leaves us at number one in uh rlcs points so we're number one 998 right now um we're gonna get ourselves the rlcsx major champion title which is sick as well you guys watch me for a long time you know i love collecting those in-game titles so uh yeah overall sleek weekend not gonna lie i was super happy with our performance as a team uh we we beat a rogue that was playing extremely well they beat envy for the space station for the beat the peeps for oh um and then we came to the finals brought them to game seven they beat us in the first series game seven we had the bracket reset advantage because we hadn't lost in the tournament yet and they lost at the beginning um so they beat us in the first series in game seven by one goal we lost um and then the second series ended up winning four two and we took the whole major championship so yeah super happy about that and my last time i put granny for the major and i guess ended up working out we got the dub so so yeah let's get into the games though we got the shadow here and nina creative i'm not sure how to say his name maybe it's nae nae it could potentially be nae nae i guess i'm gonna call created though i'm not sure how to say the first part it's all complicated i'm just leaving it for me it looks like so i'll just go for the shot there we go good start so as soon as you see your teammate like fly past the ball like that or go for a bump i know it's like a much higher level thing what miss just did right there just going for a bump like that but as soon as you see your teammate try to go for something like that you should try to take advantage and move forward a little bit on the situation missing turn again i'm gonna single jump challenge so i can get back quicker i'm just gonna kind of hold them off here try to bump them off this as well bumps and twos are ridiculously opposite threes as well to be honest if you do at the right time definitely something you got to take advantage of you get the chance messed up a little bit so i'll use this as my chance to take this boost be annoying take it back here keep control of the ball you can't catch me i know that i full boost that situation just really good position to be in i'm gonna fall behind missed here wait for miss to get back and then i can challenge there we go good follow up gonna be a point in that dribble where he kind of has to throw the ball away and that's all i'm waiting for in that situation i'm not gonna throw myself away if i know mrs and back get flicked as last man and then get a scored on right like to the left side here get a kill try to leave it for miss really good trying to play there playing off the wall to one try to bump them makes them have to throw the ball away again kind of the same situation as before oops otherwise miss wanted to go for the the pinch no no no problem i think i think you want to go for a pinch there or just hit it across i'm not sure hello not 100 sure he was going for that i think potentially that was the pinch the mid-right boost did it forward that's three i think miss passes that most of the time but kind of a risky thing to do in two just get that high put this down left now nice one for mist hit it back nice it's a good fake on the first guy and the second one we got a 50 so i'm gonna kill the boost pretty good amount the challenge went from miss there dudes is a lot of just challenging really well i think we're doing a pretty good job of that so far this game let's go for the bump so i'll speed up a little bit here and as soon as i saw again the same situation as soon as i saw he's going for the bump putting us in that prime position to get a goal i'm gonna go as quick as i can and try to capitalize on that right i don't want to slow down there give him a chance to dodge the bump for cover and i get a save out of it i don't think miss gossip i don't think miss got that boost midfield the way he ended up moving his car after the fact didn't look like he did oh my bad i didn't realize he turned again might be a goalie okay potentially would have saved it off the second touch i'm not sure get some pad team good flippy set good try try to kill time for miss he died so play it off the water myself miss spawn there gonna work out quite well actually even though i got bumped be behind miss he knows his first challenge he wins the ball perfect if not i have the ball anyway all right we'll definitely take that nice little soft touch to the top corner i know he's in a weird spot so i'm trying to hit it off the wall to be honest i'm being fully honest i wasn't trying to shoot i tried to hit up the the backboard to myself make him panic off the first shot and then hit off the back wall just gonna steal this there we go do you like to see again the same situation i was talking about it's a lot of what happens in twos i push forward for the demo i push for the aggressive play misrecognized that instantly went for the convert but i hit it forward he did good job at that forced touch to the side and misses on gonna be hard for him to save still going for a hard double potentially and for the crazy angle for the content nice i was really afraid to put that low there i was gonna have anything that i shoot high there's one on the back wall so if i bounce that low i'm gonna be able to follow it up no matter what it's a good job to play that in that way good follow up for miss on the kickoff the beauty of cheating on kickoff does amazing things you cheat just the right way you could pretty much win every single ball and kick off you can react to absolute worst case and best case scenario and the absolute best players do that really well let us get in the way this be annoying get a bump i'll leave that now for miss i don't have any boost here so i'm just going to fake this to be honest nice misrecognized back there that i faked it as well it's kind of like a dummy play in soccer when you just let it go through your legs type of thing i thought miss might have had the demo there so i waited an extra second it's fine bumped him high so he's not going to have an easy way to recover off that i might have trolled on that might have trolled they can get back yeah that's my bad i try to pass back to miss i try to hit like the perfect pass back to him but it went nowhere i mistimed it good shot from him though well played well played seven seconds left they can't come back try to see if we hit something good maybe in seven i don't know if we can eventually i was looking for missed oh i didn't i didn't really look though i kind of just like guessed it'd be a cross i was like tunnel visions on the ball i should have went for something alone there probably in the solo play it's twos after all a lot of what twos is a lot of solo plays bums dribbles stuff like that i should have probably just went alone but that's fine all right good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs all right we got a really sweaty game to end this off kinsey and rapid see this goes two pro players as well play twos very often these are very very good two slayers for sure so by no means this easy game to win kind of baited one in there pretty well which is good for us got two demos the whole team's dead for at least six seconds they know that they're gonna take their time on the ball when they have it kind of messed up it looks like so i can take advantage just gonna go quick that's fine don't mind that situation good double all rabbit could do here really is just throw this away i'll let them we bought a missed take my time here another one's across so all i can do again is kind of display that in a way that makes it awkward on the first man and hopefully we can get something out of it also this goal explosion is so sick i actually found this like probably like i found it for the first time in a game probably like a week ago and i told miss the better and they got one instantly i really like it i haven't got one myself yet called airstrike i believe and you guys want to get it get my time on the ball like that it's fine honestly hit him away quicker i knew one was behind i just didn't know how much boost he had and normally when someone's behind you uh in higher ranks at least i gotta go for the demo they like going for the demo to stop the dribble from happening like this for example i'm forcing the flick early but it might still be bad are we good that's why you go for the bumps like that in those situations because it forces the the player that they want to be having space on a little bit earlier let's slow down from mist i'll take the boost here play it back to myself play into that little pocket of open space there see me miss ball now trying to show them that i'm leaving it my body language in my car well played good dribble there's a little little open portion of field there i hit that ball too and it's going to give us just the right timing to get a play out of that but high forward go for a shot myself there we go the classic the classy you're quick at it at the very last moment if you know what's in you just hit it at the bottom of your car that works so well in 3v3 it's actually like the most broken thing in threes because everyone panics more cars on the field equals more panic a lot of the time so very good thing to do in threes place to myself kind of hit it back to mid side that way at least has somewhat of an advantage on this situation but if i could follow that up it's even better that'll be as annoying as possible not get them any time on the ball i thought no boost i was able to win like three touches in a row there so honestly best case scenario again rapid from behind bumping so that should just tell me that i need to speed it up in those situations instead of taking it slow if every time they're out their automatic solution to my dribble is i'm bumping i still have unlucky to be honest that's really a fake from rapid though he took a second instead of just taking a quick shot and because of that slight second hesitation and they'd miss kind of prejump panic a little bit made it a lot harder for him gonna be over wow the insta challenge that's extremely risky extremely risky if i instantly pop that ball over him 100 to go for us but hard to expect someone to go like that when there's so much risk involved in that it's something that you pretty much only see in rank you wouldn't really see that in like a high pressure situation or anything and frank there really is no consequence for losing what do you lose just numbers yeah i mean something you don't see very often very interesting challenge though could definitely go the other way kind of a 50 50 thing the bumps are gonna keep coming out it's gonna work though the 2b2 strap man i'm telling you watch i'm going to start going for a couple of bumps here and i promise we're gonna get a go out of at least one of them tattoos is hitting around two it's fine maybe actually the ball's in a pretty good spot for us here make it awkward for him backwards gonna give miss the ball next so to get this back boost here i'm gonna preach on this miss should be back in time so shouldn't be terrible for us even if that ball gets over me it's going to be a free ball for miss so not a bad situation at all you absolutely destroyed that ball holy spine i thought you tried to go for a quick shot there you can really tell put it to the side see what he does here pressuring for miss 1v1 now i almost slaughtered it look at attempts rabbit has no boost miss knows this and you go for a solo play it's a bump maybe nice really good it looked weird it looked really weird to be honest the bombs man are they broken are they broken sometimes i kind of wish part of me makes me want to see a day where rocket league has like a ghost game mode where you just go through everyone else's car and it's strictly just passing plays and just insane plays it to work just super hard for anything to go in i think that'd be a lot more entertaining to watch than the the very bump heavy game in which we have right now but either way hope you guys enjoyed sweaty game there at the end very high remark love you hope you guys enjoyed having us have a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace even more
