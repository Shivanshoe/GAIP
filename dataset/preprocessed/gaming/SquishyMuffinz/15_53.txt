yo what's up guys gonna be playing some threesome today with justin and yeah you're gonna be playing casual just chilling for today we don't play ranked with the eggs usually just a friend of ours uh so it should be fun just chilling having a good time and uh yeah we'll still try to get some dubs get some good goals we'll see how it goes should be some good times though all right for the first game we got ourselves uh skier exe kinko and albert very interesting names doesn't start off with a double tap maybe the eggs is uh not ssl by the way he's not actually a pro player or anything he's just a friend of ours been a friend of ours for a while that's a good shot that started off good placement [Music] take that corner maybe justin double close i should beat them all this is fine i think like a good thing about uh playing casual is you really get to practice like you can focus on your rotations really hard because you know how people are like obviously as insane if you're a pro i think this is why there's actually kind of a valuable thing justin actually plays a lot more casual than most people that are pro players he actually likes to play casual overrank most of the time i think he just used some really good things though like it teaches you how to like play deeper back like you don't have people so far like up pressuring you all the time like you're doing like super high ssl games but i think it teaches you stuff that you can't actually get out of rank to my opinion it's actually like might be like controversial to say that but i think it actually does teach you some some good stuff as a pro player it's like another form of free play if that makes sense players are so decent these are still like ssl level players they're definitely not like high super high so like we normally do play this guy is a super sign legend title there's been ssl before good touch from justin it's fine he's just coming in hot i'll be far left here if he wants to use me maybe a double i'll just wait for it it would have been crazy a little ambitious good shot though guys so you could practice playing super deep practice like focusing on rotation more so than trying to read the opponent because most of the time i mean obviously you get to the point where you're that high level like if you're a pro player high level games are very like mistake like one mistake causes a goal right so and this is not so so much the case that you can definitely make more mistakes in this so it gives you that freedom to just focus on stuff outside of just reading the opponent perfectly which is normally what you have to do at the highest level like i said doesn't apply for everybody because most of you guys watch this video aren't going to be at the highest level i'd say like obviously 99.9 percent of you guys aren't but that's why i personally think there is some value in casual but you could find value at lower levels as well i think in it it's also nice to just enjoy the game for what it is a lot of stress involved and playing casual obviously but there's definitely like a improvement aspect to it as well i think can be overlooked in a way guys turn and shoot quick close like focusing on when i'm turning like right here i turn back middle to like leave myself as an option right normally i probably wouldn't do that because a little bit riskier but just an idea that i can like kind of mess with and see what it does like see the outcome of that and there's really no risk in it because in ranked obviously the risk would be losing my points if that's a bad play but and this there's no risk you don't lose anything if you lose or if you score them it doesn't really matter so i like to look at that so i like to play with justin and eggs every now and then when they do run casual i think it's fun little thing to do to get some extra practice in a different way slightly different way i pass up the justin you missed the boost though so it's a little bit later than i thought but almost dunked them still the downside of the no look the no look passes you're not really sure exactly where your teammate is but sometimes it works nice [Music] oh we both went that's not bad let's save it follow up as well uh if you didn't bump me i was passing it justin it's probably gonna be a goal shoot off that try to pass back to justin still he's off the ceiling almost worked it's a back wall farm it's actually like really useful to do that i think underrated thing those little back passes i think backpacks in general will like definitely be more part of the meta in a bit if people don't use them anywhere near enough a lot of time there's no option forward people try to just force an option forward when there really isn't one i think that's something that people definitely start doing more back passes it's like such a useful thing you have no way forward a lot of time and people to try to force force force to the corner you gotta go for net they try to play for a shot it's not there something you can't actually go for instead of just like faking a touch forward play it back you still full control you can rotate get boost your team has like a much better position in general on the field if you do that rather than trying to force a play and then having another guy come in and bait himself in on a ball that's not even worth going for it a lot of times the pass back's way better and you'll always have someone behind you if you're rotating properly so i think that the pass back will definitely become more meta in the future but as of right now i still definitely not use as much as it could be and uh i try to look forward as much as i can because i know useful can be yeah good first game let's get the next one gonna be the same guys this is casual but i have to look up a new lobby thankfully pass to the right pass back to me close might be rough i pass off to the right for justin actually good save nice little pre-flip there [Music] [Music] also i think like i'm like the pro level to like the lower levels a big thing that people just have a hard time doing is like reading the play so i think that's a good thing to practice in this too just trying to pre-position in the right spot and again there's no downside to practicing anything in this like you lose you don't lose anything all the time people are scared to practice because they're scared of what they'll lose like the consequence of losing right they're scared to try new things because they know that if they lose you're losing something you're losing e though and it's gonna be harder to get that rank back and stuff like that but practice like stuff like what i just do right there trying to read the play better like trying to move into a better position where the ball is going to be i'll give another example in a second but i can't fall asleep i'm going to stay here for example try to practice like covering back post stuff like that like little things show up the game where it's at right now where's the most likely to go right without a pre-position and just be in a better spot you're gonna be ahead of the game you're gonna seem like a faster player because you're pre-positioning in a good way that's something that i think like gimmick for example was very very good at i've always thought he's exceptional at that where he positions and where he you can read the ball going next is crazy it's almost like he sees the future but there's definitely little things you can like kind of try to do all the time like to keep track of little rules you can you can have in your head the ball's on the left side someone's on the left side of the ball it's most likely to go to the opposite side or stuff like that little things it's most likely to go left here obviously little things like that that you can always try to keep in your head and make it easier for you to read the play and get ahead of the game i think that's something that definitely like you just learn your on your own with time but can definitely be worked on as well shop from justin i don't know if he has like like a casual video like this just having fun messing around not taking it too serious also just another example of something you can work on boost management trying to keep 100 boost like i said right there at all times reading the play throwing in fakes little things that you can do off the ball that you you might be a little bit scared to practice and rank you can definitely practice in casual and you'll find those things are going to make you better than the ranked gameplay that you're trying to play the same way all the time because you know you're scared to make an adjustment and see how things go it's a really good example of stuff that can help you i think you can't be scared of adjustment and you know what those adjustments might bring might be negative at first but i might eventually bring you positive so i think it's worth trying those things at the very least it was a very interesting play it works though that's some eggs justin just shoot it nicely done yeah a lot of the positioning stuff off the ball i think it's a lot of like pretty obvious stuff like you can kind of tell but when you can read like the intricate situations when like a 50s coming up or like something like this for example i don't know what's best to do with this next ball that's like a really tough skill to learn i think i just wanted to save points i wanted them too but i didn't get saved for that somehow actually a good shot [Music] nice i just controlled us to see if you can make a play 52 of them play back no one's actually back so i gotta touch it again oh i thought you're excited but i should've just went right away oh good i'm gonna make that wall dash tutorial by the way guys haven't done it yet you got to do it and i want to make it good too it's going to be hard it's such a hard thing to explain because i want to explain like the little ones and the past ones as well and they're both really really hard to to kind of put into perspective on how to do it and do it consistently and it took me a long time to learn like a very long time to learn it properly and i feel like i have it down now but it's still it's just such a difficult thing really good angle i don't know how i scored that i'm not gonna lie [Music] very very nice a vehicle from pinko oh nevermind gonna wait back while here i don't have a quick shot so i need a panic oh dustin's shot puss it's like a dunk at least forcing hit it across now try to scoop this up adjust to take double tap maybe he's gonna bring this away to me and that's a really good example of what i was talking about i was reading the play like perfectly pretty much i'm last time back for a while but i wait for the touches just right forced two out of the play pretty much for nothing and i make the third guy go as well that's really good yeah it's actually fun i actually enjoyed uh just playing this game chilling a lot of fun underrated this game isn't casual with the boys hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace [Music] you
