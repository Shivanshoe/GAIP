guys enjoy today's video yo what is up guys in the last video we played some 1v1 games and I promised dad played other side of games in 1b ones for Tuesday so let's get into it see if we can get some more wins let's see how it goes reporting its Mary from the last video for the first game or to fake it wait for the flag like it's like holding gonna pop it high just to go all the way back and grab that corner Boosh I missed shake him just stay in front you kinda have to go for 50 things gonna go for this boost in the corner I'm guessing he's gonna win this just boost powder so I'll hit up the wall make a little more awkward for him but if he's got good mechanics still gonna be really difficult to deal with stand in front good challenge him can't get the shot so I'll go for his boost up the kill touch it back and I'll make a play go forward here I'll just take a couple touches on the ball she does such an awkward like exchange say we're both kind of does mine gave me each other back and forth sorry for went quiet there I was just focused on his cart waiting for him to be the position where I can hit it around him touch it once it's gonna be there a quick shutter followed myself it's gonna fake again maybe that's not good he pinches it alright good try to fake him well you made it all the way for the bump how it was even no no I got too cheeky I could have probably double tapped he missed the ball but that's all in hindsight obviously how did I realized I was missing I wouldn't even know went for the bump much easier to say a step in hindsight but daddy in general wasn't a bad one I got a bad quick though and I situation like that I don't want to kick off super hard I got the mid boost I see the opponent going back to the corner boost so if I see that all happening I'm just gonna go for the shot quick it doesn't have to be a crazy well-placed shot just something that's fast enough to go in before you can get back right that's what I aim for is aimed low on target boom we got another careful after that as well does it really kick off from him just bang us off my own wall maybe that I messed him up a little bit you can't get a fast shot yeah at least somehow such that have a safe sell my boost here we go have enough to get to this one and [ __ ] off the free shuttle be consciously like aware of how much boosts your using as well don't overuse your boosting ones especially I mean it's an important skill in every single game mode but especially in 1v1 because there's gonna be people that just boost our view taking laps around your corner be straight you want to be in a position real it doesn't even matter because you have so much boost that you held onto you so you're back here I'll take the middle head all the way down I'm in a really bad spot though I was gonna go off the top I was like trying to fake that I was going off the top but you didn't can't Eve is doing because of it so it all the control in the situation and let's like I turn the challenge of instantly hard all you mean it flip to be honest excellently fat-fingered my jump button forgot it though because I use my thumb for my arrow right which is on square so I'll try to just arrow right into it but I press my X as well didn't I jump so you guys didn't know I fat-finger all four of my buttons so my the weight just distributes between you know different parts of my thumb did different buttons very much my thumb's finished always over the four buttons there here we go he gots been pretty good though I won't lie out of all these 1v1 games I have a feeling if he cues again we'll probably run into him again but he saw he's got good mechanics you can tell and he knows what to do with the ball yes time definitely a good opponent to play against here I have time waitwhat just happy I hit that last pop this up double might be able to reach it there you go for some reason I'm slamming that top corner when it's wide open that I don't think you should do especially in 1v1 because if you missed that you know you're gonna get counter attacked on pretty quick nice double reset you say F can I kick off anyone to just shoot it so I for the cheeky play there's a really good double flip reset though yeah it's super hard for him to stop because again you saw it you went for at the right time but I have that second flip they're just not ready for it thanks for the nice one there I missed it I think I stubbed my wave - what the heck I'm every time I kept taking kick off that I'm gonna go for the instacharge that's the 200 IQ strap when you'd be faking all the time what a save did best shot at the end there it's kind of hard to shoot but regardless his bed so 12 boost so I need mm-hmm never mind I'll just shot good placement good time and he took it well I don't think I needed to panic on that one ball that I jump for gave him a shot she waited it was a good play to make as well he's just blocking the lock in the shot angle and all I got to do is pop it over him there doesn't waste my position still in a spot record and get back pretty easily good save on the double day one of the few ways you could save that double type it again a really good position to get out of that shutter bump them again ultimate BM uh-huh okay this time you'll think I'm not faking it undermined okay back-to-back double slippery sit am I stuck ready ended he was sitting on her to be demo by than made himself I'm gonna say no problem my gosh you did right Simon cheek here oh no oh wait so I went for the double reset off the ceiling I wasn't sure yet another one but I wasn't too bad of a spot it's such a weak spot we got a double reset on the scheme take those my pastel Masuda those three seconds flip reset no match for my turn what can we do with this ball a lot of ideas a lot of ideas I'll do up there city does make a play make a play I'm ready for it nice sorry it's passing back he's passing bet I do something cool what would I do trying to make the pass look nice oh no it's okay so good hopefully brother all right good first game a lot of good goals throughout that let's get into the next probably to be him again to be honest so see me a fun game no matter what's getting into it we got another good chunk of points for that alright so we rented some foreign strategy this time I believe this guy was like a really high grand champ only one player last season very good with his uh his flicks on the ball when he has time so something we can really give him space so if he likes to driving for a demo a lot any challenges like super aggressively if I'm remembering correctly how he plays we'll see what we can do tough match though oh my god quick I'm gonna panic a bit fighting go just pass it back down to me sir probably staying on this ball but make sure you go for him people to shoot there we go yeah you said super aggressive on that but special abuse that ball was like 90% and we got it out so pretty close today do that but you might get it back really surprise you why I should go to score for you but again the empty Nets for me not so empty dude they're filled with invisible goalkeepers for some reason I miss nice cottage we bump them up super high I want to see what you got back there they can play it back you're behind me so I had to be careful for the rush yeah not a feeling you to do that but that was a fancy way to score all the way down the field that's good to check behind you every now and then when you hear someone like that I know he's an aggressive player cuz I played him before like last season spider feeling he would try to rush that put him quite a few times less easy that's why I kind of know if I'm gonna play someone once I really another stop so a lot of the first times I play people I actually end up losing to them in ones like the really high level one players but after I put him a couple of times I understand they play more much easier to play against him for me a few good was it it yeah like that's not something a lot of people go for because I'm in a position where I have 80 boost he knows I had full boost like he knows I was still pretty filled up but he decided to go for a super agro challenge actually got a go little bit gonna take his boost here he's probably go for a shot off that so I wanted to lay it all right gonna back off here surprise I save I can touch this back it's gonna go up the wall so I'll have time to play with this see what he does where he goes see he likes to challenge at every time every single time and like I said the invisible goalkeepers I strike again I missed the empty net and I scored a much harder one but much much harder empty net on a fake a challenge I didn't delay him at all oh no I reckon take one pad to pad I'll be in a decent spot you see might abuse to stop this I'll try to save all my booster gotta be smart with what we have here what was it crazy good touch gonna flick this in a sec but it's not be fast enough do anything should be you cool here we go we're cutting him off a good time here funny the right time the challenge right time to slow down his play it's playing role though he's making changes out of nothing by being really aggressive with Loeb [ __ ] it's pretty smart others really dumb this should never work or whatever trying to flick it ended up blocking them say months like 2030 boost kickoff go first soon shot maybe it's fine good bumping maybe one more time what can we do with this probably not mushrooms to Charlie getting away and you go for that probably actually have more time to play with that ball go down a lot more with it he's low you I got his boots as well I guess the upper beasts there yeah we go I'll try to keep like a mental note of how much boost your phone Annette I know it's a hard thing to do especially in like three three or 2v2 there's more cars on the field and it's more like times you're probably not paying attention to other people's cars and stuff but and ones especially it's like a huge huge skill to have I know he's gonna be pretty little stuck in my goal here so I have so much time to turn this ball in I'm gonna have to panic for this so I always kind of just keep track of where they are how much booty I have it makes it all so much simpler really but the first year was a lot of fun a second game was much more competitive and felt but so fun as well but hope you guys been enjoying the isn't got up to Grand Champion the season that surprises me but yeah anyway guys I hope you enjoyed the video for today and for the next one I'll
