yo what's up guys gonna be queueing with jnabs for today gonna be playing both twos and threes so whatever we find we'll play let's get into it let's even get some dubs see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves nebra and stealth [Applause] take this mid-right boost try this pressure in here i don't even need a full commit to this but not just making them like not be able to follow it up make it really awkward on them challenges from naps i just make awkward touches again put them in awkward spots you never want to give them like free possession pretty much is the main thing that you should think about in twos never want to give them like too much space to work with or too much time it's a lot easier said than done to be honest because a lot of people are really good at making sure they have the space when they need it try for naps just to keep us in off the wall you can't follow that up anything that fits away now snaps as well which is good very interesting uh touch there from him wait for a neighbor's touch it's gonna be a bang back probably save my boost here i'm not gonna use the last 30 i just want to land on this for 50. like that shot from that actually creates a lot of pressure he doesn't have to do much for it either like that a lot wait for the bouncer off the wall but for the past actually good that he blocked me because naps wasn't even there yet so it would have been a bad pass it's been a very choosy game so far very good uh shot from hard to get power on those shots he often does a good job at it there we go the bouncer the bouncer always catches them off guard stop this on the american damn lobby full of canadians in here actually a lot of really good upcoming canadian players i feel like that are getting better and better and before i used to be the same like five players like mj knapp's timmy uh lucian's up there taroko let the we used to be really good see the same players all the time but now it's uh wow that was laggy and now it's a lot different a lot more players in canada play patiently back over here and absolutely behind the ground so as long as i challenge it around here should be fine should be fun nicely done wait back all year unfortunately i missed that boost it might still work out though uh right idea wrong execution though i do like that idea a lot not for the ceiling pinch not enough power but again right idea just a little bit off on the execution the challenge i'm just gonna wait here because he's probably gonna be into this and he's never touched first so i just wanna wait this is myself a little bit and i can just bump him make a situation a lot harder when you do something like that instead of just throwing yourself away i feel like you want to make it as hard as possible for the opponent to get around you right so don't just throw yourself away don't make yourself an easy defender to get by it's gonna wait back while you same thing there i'm not going to just throw myself away early let them flick that over me i'm just going to wait patient nice shot from that's the job so i tried to fake the high touch straight away as well popped it up i had all the advantage here i picked the high touch and i just shoot low i ended up missing but it works out really well as a pass and that's why they often say that the best uh passes or missed shots but good first game there all right last game we got knee brand stealth again [Music] solid matchup take my time on the shot here actually i thought you would like respect the fact that i could get a touch and shoot really quick but he actually just ends the challenge just smart of him because he gave me one extra second of space there it's a goal well played not to give me that time nice good play from that's very 3v3 play we just had right there the pass over to him he goes for the double gets done shoot it uh well unfortunately i tried to block his his touch i went like more wide i didn't go for the ball itself i went like more wide for his hit play to open space while there if i get that boost pretty big no guys i swear just be easier to score them on one is pretty big there again try to read this touch more so than the the hit itself because it's not possible to double off that if they're just gonna get a touch play it high awkward spot for him you always kind of want to like if you're about to leave the ball after a touch make sure it's in a spot where they're gonna have like a really awkward time getting a control touch right you want it to be like a hit back into your teammate i'm just gonna go for this should be easy for him now unless he gets bumped then it's actually really bad for us nice on that boost try for naps i might be a goal man that was so hard to read because that's okay i don't like those situations like it was good from knocks to bump him but he was bumping the other guy and then i was gonna go like okay this is my chance to go and as soon as i go his teammate was right right next to him and then hits it away very very hard thing to read a shot from naps his job just to be ready to shoot that actually like a perfect shot in general i think he own gold a little bit but really well done a lot of people can spot that opening so quick trying to fit through go for a bump here too make him hit it away vehicle that's kind of like the the big upside to go for a bump there too you make him jump early regardless of like if that was their play before they're going to be thinking about you and the touch will probably be worse i find if you have to surround me snaps me back almost some pads here that wants me to go i think so i'll just go unfortunate not a boost i had honestly i should have went back ball i think going back would have been the better play that's the thing is like in twos that's essentially a one-to-one play if i can't go back all right so but in threes i could challenge that early enough to the point where my teammates back for sure but i was last man the whole time on three is the product that would never really be able to happen there's a good shot from him for sure but in threes that would never be able to happen because you could just challenge early enough and have someone trade the challenge pretty much like you challenge it goes over you and someone's behind you and they don't have control anymore but in twos it's a lot harder to do that properly it's actually almost impossible in some situations like i hear it's essentially just a 1v1 for a very long time and threes it'll never be that that's why you'll see like solo plays shine a lot more in twos makes people look a lot um more individually talented than they would in threes for example and get away with a lot more solo wise for sure try to go for some insane read for some reason and touch from naps i don't know if i can actually reach this should be fine 14 boost here trying to make him jump if he jumps early he's gonna have a hard time turning us into our net the very least so to go for that fake touch to control and then get another one but played it well one thing they're doing well is they're covering like both options really well in a situation where you can fake something they're covering both of the the fakes every time trying to make the panic here sit in front of them there's never a way to shoot that so i was trying to be annoying you get that boost pretty big i think you got it ah so close couldn't quite get the the second touch to score off of it have banged this to naps we're going for some crazy 3v3 plays right now the passing plays the high flying passing plays maps can't really reach it for the the shot unfortunate too because i got my back boost taken should be fine i put the next challenge every time there i bumped him into it instead of demoing him which is i don't know if it's better or not to be honest they're gonna have that away and that's when the boost is pretty good there i think that's a that's a win that engagement my time get a flip played over him i'll nap sweat it might be a little bit messy if i left it for naps actually could have probably been a goal i didn't even know that he could go for it i was trying to kill time relax might be in all right we're good i like to wait for a half second after i got demoed oh my that's just crazy i like it for a half second after i got demo then it was just internet i should have i should have definitely turned toward net first though my instinct was just turned toward boost because i didn't really look at the the screen to be honest looked at my second monitor but good games today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all
