yo what's up guys let me try out this card that i actually never even realized i had it's called the ronin i've never made a video with this car i've actually never even seen it in my items i don't really look here too often because i always just mean the octane but i was looking through my cars and i was like i've never tried this car it looks pretty damn cool let's make a video on it why not and i was messing with it in free play the last like 20 minutes and it feels weird like it feels super speedy for some reason it feels like i'm turning faster it feels really weird i don't know maybe it's like all placebo but it feels really nice so i'm gonna give it some tries and some games for today with uh sosa from pittsburgh nights should be some good games let's get into it hopefully we can get some dubs i think we're still pretty high happy too as we are so yeah let's get into the game see if we can win let's see how it goes and one last thing before we get into the video guys if you're

guys enjoyed today's video enjoy all right for the first game playing it's bu and kef this q is actually really quick so these are probably high ring it's a long car so you know i can abuse the uh bit of flicks with it it's always the one advantage that long cars definitely have the flick potential is always better than the short cars maybe you won't be one for a while here really tough spot to be in i can't really help unlucky hard spot for sosa to be in there obviously there won't be one for quite a while and for some reason he's mad at so-so interesting maybe something we're missing maybe they're friends or something not sure but can i get a good touch on that should be fine for sosa anyway don't want to get a touch they just go straight middle so you can't get a good touch on it might as well leave it at least fix the opponent most of the time in a situation i'll let him waste all his boost here he's probably already only at 40 boost now it's challenged pretty freely check out timing i'm going to take a 40-ish boost off of this that way i can just grab the next one play it to myself keep full possession here and have the ball in a pretty good situation trying to just pick them to go for the ball i never actually do that's fine though so to force out a free ball for my teammate now you can make a play out of this most likely pass to him just right in the back okay i was trying to pass to my teammate but i will definitely most definitely take that perfect cross map pinch what can you do about that you have to be sitting in a goal to save that pretty much or be like at midfield and react instantly but that's super hard to expect can't blame the last guy back on their team for not being ready for that good goal from us even though it was lucky luck doesn't necessarily make something a bad goal in my opinion especially in a competitive setting a lot of players get a lot of goals in you know very competitive settings that are you know considered lucky but that might be like their trait like turbo pulse is a good example a lot of people think a lot of his goals are luck based but he's in a position to have the luck goes away right so you got to give him credit for that ah that's right it's off because i'm getting bumped if i wasn't getting bumped in situations can be really easy to save but the bump is what makes it tough yeah luck is definitely a um love and hate relationship for me in this game a lot of things don't go your way but there will be things that definitely do so thank you when you can get it let's stay on this ball i'm not trying to throw it away early ah that bump would have been huge so someone there's gonna be a goal against us unless they somehow mess up again but i just don't think it's possible they did the impossible is just happening this game and we counter wow okay this has been a very very interesting very interesting first game but we will take it and we will move on with our day as if nothing is going wrong sometimes things just don't go your way in a match-up sometimes there's games like this we'll take it man if every day for me it was like this game i would be so happy i'd be so so happy if every game went like this every day i got on everything just went in my favor every time someone had mentioned that they messed it up every time i got a challenge on the ball just go straight in their net beautiful i think it's the car dude i think this car is a good luck charm it's a secret weapon i even got the boost and i got the kill what can't this car do i went for the the sharp angle let's hope this again try to stay on the ball here it's a good fit because my teammate can probably challenge it up it goes backwards to him which is perfect it's not bad to lose a 50 in that situation should be able to get back nice should be able to challenge this i can follow it up look that over one way on the right side for his touch here kind of mess it up so i can just challenge again my first challenge here it's probably gonna go middle based off where he is this next challenge at least it's a good pinch from them definitely not what i was expecting looked over one good bump from him teammate can follow this up easier for the left side it's a good beat from us can leave it on 1v1 for a second it's going for the bump what i'm going to look like interesting let's get a challenge we'll see on the way quick i hit it around them i didn't want to go for a golden situation obviously trying to make him have a tougher route on way to the goal right i also don't know if it's root or route because i've heard people say different things but i've always called it so let's have a debate in the comment section how you guys say it i've always called it root here that's how the teachers say it in school when we learned it was root but i've heard people in canada also call it route i'm sure there's people different like preferences throughout the world though curious who you guys think or if you even know what i was talking about when i said root they're not like the it was like the root of the plant and you know different ways of saying things i don't know i'm always so curious how many of you guys truly understand what i'm trying to say when i'm saying it because everyone says stuff so differently like a challenge from us this car is actually crazy i'm not gonna lie i feel like a big plank of wood like highly supposed to get by this car on a flick mine i'm stealing it all right good first game we got really lucky but maybe it's the car maybe the car is a lucky charm right you never know par feels really nice they're not gonna lie and like i said look how long this thing is when it comes to challenging if you put your whole top of the car toward the ball there's no way that ball is getting past you this car is so big let's get to the next game so you can finish off with two back-to-back dubs let's get into it let's see how it goes after last game video we're playing against the exact same people be you and kef two games in a row i don't think we'll get as lucky this game with some stuff so it's gonna be a much sweatier game but these are definitely a good opponent so gonna be fun no matter what very good start from sosa those touches to yourself if you get good at them you can practice them pop it to yourself you have so much time so many options especially if you get good at using your flip as well after the fact so definitely a good thing to practice gives you a lot of space on the ball if you can actually pull that off be able to give yourself a good first touch like that try to play in a spot where they can't actually get a immediate follow-up good bang from sosa i'm just gonna try to go for a bump here anything to get the ball off boom not terrible because you can't actually get behind this ball yet it's only bad if also makes a little bit of a mistake but it's okay kind of awkward for him i think he got faked if anything it wouldn't be bad if he was able to challenge right away there because the ball was out of his possession for about two seconds i was saying that play because i wasn't able to you have to wait a little bit longer and i was expecting it made it a little bit awkward uh stuff bounce to read almost ended up working out better actually almost gave so so much better shot opportunity but it's still not a bad situation good bump from them makes it a little bit difficult for sales for a sec but i'll be back behind good save he's gonna follow up himself try to win this firework and react to the 50 it's probably a mid somehow over one go for the bump on the other one it's gonna be legal there we go you gotta slow that down it gives us a lot of options again same situation practice these things that give you options in game right don't practice the same mold hitting it off the back all over and over again in free play if you're trying to get to the next level if you're a high rank already try to do new things try to learn new things that are going to open up a lot of opportunities for you in game obviously if you're lower rank practicing just hitting the ball hard is not a bad thing at all but when you do have the time to make a little bit of a play more than just hitting the ball forward try to be able to use your time wisely right let's challenge him here he doesn't have an option on goal because he can play this forward to me if he wants he's going alone so i'll go back now that's my cue to back off that's gonna give me a free goal wait no but the thing that happened to them last game just happened to me see this is karma thought it was a free goal but nope couldn't reach it the bounce was a little bit too fast for the amount of speed i had going in on it and it was unscorable like this was last game they're going for the bump every time i pop it up to myself now it's a good counter to have obviously when somebody's doing that but ended up getting scored on still never mind i keep on talking and they keep on saving everything i say so but keep on calling the opposite of what i hope is gonna happen because the game is now gonna get mind-gamed and then i'm gonna win so i'm gonna get scored on here okay see it worked i thought i actually now i'm so deep in this mind game that i'm confused i was trying to trick the game meanwhile i'm over here tricking myself grab these pads from them doesn't do a whole lot but it keeps my speed going forward at least gotta get kill on one closely can use me here a lot of really close calls already but we have a lot of pressure which is the main thing this game can go straight down it's not shootable should be okay for us got the boost which is good and just back up into the back post of the goal there we go good challenge from us so i play mid i'm trying to look at my teammate middle there i got above i got in front of the ball that way it can come to me i can actually get a good pass mid but salsa wasn't able to push up for it i was smart of them not too good reach from him i would have had the double well played see i can play this to myself here play it up the wall then we get a dunk it's a good bump again the same situation i have time on the ball so why not play in a way that i can actually follow it up myself i put it off the wall for my teammate there you can play to the left wall for me wait for his touch that's fun try to create some space for myself here playing to the corner that i can get the boost here and turn get a challenge as well teammates should have a free touch let's say done it's going to be over him i can wait left side if he wants to use me should be a bang good save ah so close but so hard to be there quickly but i didn't need to be i honestly could have taken my time i think they would have panicked regardless so it's on me for not taking my time there holder position on the back wall is gonna be the best possible spot to have a chance of saving that even though it's gonna be tough to save did a good job of getting there back was the only way that actually becomes possible to save i think he's gonna be there close call again a lot of opportunities this game a lot of good chances but coming out on top i started moving away from the goal because obviously i see my teammate it's going toward the save there so i might as well i'm going to go for the other corner boost put it behind my teammate there's a better beat into this ball that should be the game there we go good speed on that i recognize that guy's gonna be last back he's pushed up a little bit too close all i gotta do is beat him to the ceiling i'll leave my teammate with a wide open net as long as he's in position for and even if he's not i double tap that off the ceiling anyway most likely give me 1v1 play here the block from him i'm just going to rush this last back why not it's going to be hard for them to turn this one in now there we go all right good games though good games overall the carf was really nice it's called the ronin i believe is how you say it it's either ron and ronan i'm not sure but like i said i don't think i've ever seen this car in my inventory it's been here for a long time i have so many variations of it in painted colors but i actually don't think i've ever seen it or used it it's definitely the first time i've ever used it um so yeah let me know if you guys have this car and you tried it yourself i think it feels really nice the turning feels great uh the air rolling in the air feels super clean as well for a long car hitbox like this it might even be the batmobile hitbox i'm not sure it feels super long it feels really nice not gonna lie so give it a try for yourselves guys a lot of good games here a lot of really close calls a lot of fun stuff going on but yeah ended up securing i think 2k mmr off that as well let me go look probably around 2 km omar off of that 1996 almost there almost there we're only four points off 2kmr super close but yeah hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night for those times when you guys are watching this like comment and make sure you hit that subscribe button because
