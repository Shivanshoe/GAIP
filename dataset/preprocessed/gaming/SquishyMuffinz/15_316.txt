which is crazy to think about so thank you for making that dream a possibility and yeah enjoy the video you guys love yo-yo ders up you guys in the last video we finished off at 883 MMR today we're gonna figure out what rank we get placed into probably gonna finish off around 950 MMR if we win both of our games so it's pretty solid I think that's up to Diamond already which is super good considering we lost that game early on I might have stunted our one streak a little bit I'm not sure how much that affected it if it did at all but uh yeah let's get into the games for today I hopefully can get two more wins and the see how it goes we got a good game plan is all 800 plus players and one of them has a question where's profile the dreaded dreaded a question mark profile so most likely Smurfs and they're decently high ranked Smurfs so we'll see we'll see I am pretty worried about that guy particularly but we'll see I hope my teammates are nuts why'd you say GG I don't know why I said GG but we'll see nice I'm always worried about the question my profiles in there spooky try to kill one try to kill another bowl team itself good try they both Ariel for it so their aerial mechanics are ready much better in this rank good bum nice and I like how aggressive that is it's really good good job I like how aggressive they're being already like that's a huge upgrade massive upgrade from what we've been playing with seriously can be asked with sign it I guess these guys played each other last game or something maybe what I was missing nice I'll try to play this off the wall maybe I couldn't quite have the base for it I can go for a bumpy that's a big miss but I can get back I think go big save good pass middle ones a really pass those guys good plenty about his teammates they don't seem bad to be honest I'll hit this off the backboard here create a chance maybe nicely done good job and obviously I could go for a shot there like if I'm at a higher ranked game and I see that to open I'm gonna go for a shot but you don't even need to if you have two teammates that you trust can hit a shot don't be fretted off the backboard if it's a hard shot you have a higher percent chance it's gonna go in if you can just get a good pass middle not the empty net there I'm shot hit this if I can follow it up it's fine I can get the corner this year I trust my team every time I say that they missed his last back but I got a kill at least I've tried to see if I could get it around them there but it's fun nice flick close to 50 M go back take mid boost here anyhow straited though I'm heated over I could get one thing you'll notice about watching any pros gameplay is whenever they get a full boost they're not gonna immediately waste all their boost there's not a whole lot to it but maintain their speed if you can hold on to your hundred boost or as long as possible that's perfect be in the right position and usually only when you need it don't waste it just like points to moving around the field only using one you need to keep your speed to the fullest this is a good start to the first game but this guy's mindset you just checked out from the start regardless I don't think it's immature that bad to be honest with you I want to double this so bad and leave it and leave it though that works so you get the job done you don't even need to be crazy get a double tips hitting off the backboard hard teammates there empty net and there you go this is what wasn't working in the lower ranks because my teammates simply just weren't there I'm just gonna for me too all right why you gotta be like that now I did I'm going I'm playing on their team now let's see I planted their team I want to see if I can wait I could technically score he just a nice shot at me I could technically score cuz its own balls shy just like pop off oh no did I said no key just pop off on them no excavation point okay though he's play for if you still play for them I still use play for our team still okay I was waiting sake all right I'm gonna go for some double tappers or something some wolves he's playing for our team which is unfair I feel bad I feel bad for the piece for use obviously I'm not gonna throw the game but try to make it more fair least I can old goal there's no rules against own goal to get some duties being toxic but they don't know that I play for the reserve console know that score so I saw a few are you doing this is are you so hard to tell like we just playing for him like that guy I like legitimately thought it wasn't gonna do that casino org so we're like mentally I'm not like used to other than waiting salaries or didn't hit it to the corner and then your own both it's pretty childish though for sure nobody's flying like that my Tootsie Pop the bee dude shebang yeah this game's awash cuz of this guy unfortunate tell you you mindset mentality is everything in this game and applies for right to you can't care that much if your teammates like I don't know if your teammates are playing bad just ignore it yeah you mean it's not that big of a deal the games are five minutes long it's not like a counter-strike it's not like a league of Legends where if you happen to have like bad teammates you're stuck with them for a whole hour so you mean house mentality just show bad yeah this gives a wash anyway over at this point obviously there's no like there's no easy way to improve mentality that's the thing you just have to work on yourself like slowly day by day got to realize that the end of the day ranked is just virtual points yeah I mean you're playing the game to prove a point again to have fun so don't care don't care so much about stuff like that easy to say I guess it's always been one mentality any game I've ever played so into my mentality but yeah unfortunate sorry did appears for guys I had this did kind of give up on you but we still have yet to score an actual goal which I'm happy with I mean obviously that one goal that happened early on weird other team own gold and like one of the earlier episodes I could do much about that but I still have done a really good job to not score soon goal ever up to diamond I think we have to get the dimer plane against diamonds already so never over diamond easily we're at 900mm are now we're 927 a memoir and these guys were ready diamond once her point up the diamond to already not bad at all it's into the last game let's get it done let's go save all five golden lands he was all the event tokens if he had saved up from all the roadie creations we've done so far so every single episode after this one I'll open one golden lantern a per episode I never get anything good when I open stuff for items in this game but we'll do at the beginning of each one why not yeah let's get into the next game alright for our last placement gamer point he gets a dude that was on our T oh no the dude that was on our team last game he was actually solid but we have a question mark on our team maybe this smear we'll see I think so this will be a tough one though played around one I'll leave it right there that around um I'll you look for my teammate nice to make a turn that's fine I have space on my corner here I got the be show him which is good but I'd be careful the shot is in plate middle I believe in you Jim alright is not a smurf order probably at that I'm behind I'm no my keeping these question mark for follows Oh God she just cut Bob so scary getting team bumped out of your Solus and putting off the corner and no one is there no one has pushed up on offense with me it's all good though team's not going I gotta help him uh soon be a go against if I didn't forward shy like for a bump here plus I should be close to that I should turn earlier so that's my fault so I was talking about like I don't see anything but to me to have a hit middle that was there just me not believing that he could touch that mid that goes back to what I'm saying that I wasn't there to help him out if I was you know we could have a shooting opportunity there were another pass at least some there you messed up I put us off the backward now go for a kill you okay jump immediately you read that guy's pretty solid reads it's not that last game team it should go nice job be ready for the touch back there no - I don't know why did I waited on my teammate to go for this I have no idea why I did but I thought he's gonna boost order right there I didn't want to mess him up but I could have beat that guy like so easily I was I just trying to be a good teammate not my so tech dude I said it this way ended up ongoing so sad no TV that other thing right seems one like a challenge this game every time I challenge a ball midfield that they haven't won it other teams - solid right now you can just beat me too - I got my vehicle uh yeah yeah yeah he's so forfeiting already is - dude there's 2 minutes and 30 seconds left and it's 2 goals but also the ranks here aren't that fair like when you really think about it I guess the game's thinking I'm a 927 ever more against like all hunters but I have a 600 so it kind of bounces out I guess because I'm not never more but I'm not scoring that's the only thing that makes it so hard oh my god I can't put my teammate actually you shot a forfeit after that though I need one of them to pull something out here so anything I can't rely on myself for goals and this I did shoot Ilya touch around there okay well both your heads are in the exact same position and then they both get beat by that guy so leaves me in a really weird spot here for a bit and then I get bumped so we're just thought playing as a team at all and I'm bumping I came at the ball that's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine yeah we still have time gotta make a play happen you come on skills sermon okay we're good you need a quick counter nice I'll go for this one of them gonna be up and I can hit it one more time here if I can kill one that'd be perfect teammates weren't quite ready for that I guess but Michael do something I'm gonna put out the back should be hard for him so you miss should be free goal we really needed that one I really needed that one but so good try to play it out the back here one more time nice play it up see what they do okay a challenge and I'm bumpy how does this happen so much shredded and soul centered just so many team bucket again so many team bumps this man just going on their side for your boots now all right whitey may give up okay that wasn't winnable actually was not a wonderful game why is he going on their side for boost what all right yeah this game's over it's fun I want to see what I rank is that we're gonna have diamond to two losses two losses in that not bad at all like I thought you would play series oh my don't be roasted prison Michael here bro he's trying his best he's trying his absolute best promotion to Diamond one we got diamond one div for so we're almost at the diamond to you that's not bad at all but that game was like super unfair I feel to be honest my team 1894 MMR for bumping it seems all whole time at forfeiting early and then going for their corner boost at the end well I did the game give them anymore what what is that how did that work alrighty then well we lost 42 ever more for that so we've we weren't in diamond to I think if we won that game where we're a diamond to division like two or three but uh not bad at all we finished off at diamond one we had two games in the set of ten that we're extremely difficult to win that was one of them again mindset day I feel like our teammates - it was terrible like absolutely terrible dude two minutes thirty seconds love is an eternity in this game it only takes you like 5 SEC's to get down the field and get a gold the other thing about it like that man I don't know if you're if you're trying to quit and you two are down with half the game left that's very questionable very questionable but position here is really bad all around no one has any friend once touches you're just a lot of team bomb stuff like that so positioning in general just bad but hopefully we get some more quality games as time goes on up the diamond one div for them after that's a pretty much diamond to after one more win yeah not too bad we won eight lost to without scoring a single goal so not bad at all hope you guys enjoyed the games hi yourself a wonderful day or night but I'm it is when you're washing is I so you guys in the next one and make sure guys if
