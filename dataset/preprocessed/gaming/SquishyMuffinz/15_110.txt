yo what's up guys gonna be playing except threes today with gimmick and fire burner should be some good games let's get into us even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves og devil and spood status goes been a little while honestly i've been taking a little bit of a break from broccoli because i finally have a break now so it's kind of weird getting back on the grind but i got to get back into it everyone took a little break because the season ended much much needed one for sure because there's a whole year of non-stop playing right it's a lot of time we're committing to playing all the time really good passing fire there well done well done finish from gamester so i can just set the right side here i like to play off to the right because most of the time you have a teammate back right in a situation so play it off to the side we're going to have your teammate use them to help you out pass there from gimmick well done very well done pass i keep forgetting to put back on my controller overlay i know you guys have been asking for it but i keep forgetting put it on you make sure to have this good touch gotta wait patiently here it's fine i'm trying to play it soft to myself i don't want to put into the corner put it to a bad spot let fire go he's already up playing patient like that when your teammates are up it's always good you want to back out when you know you're not of use in the play play number one try to play it off back wall again i don't know if fire can actually get back can't unfortunate you make a jumps for my past middle which wasn't a bad idea it would have been a goal but after you got the clear away too tough for him to get back and help out wait for og touch it's fine it should be good for fire actually to get touching this which i played over to gimmick side almost 150. should be wide and high it's fine if he misses i'll have this always going to be a tough shot for him to to stop so i know i just take my time with it going to be a pretty easy scoring opportunity if i just take my time wait for his miss don't panic don't overthink the fact that he's up before me because at the end of the day he has to read a much harder thing than it is for me to read i take my time i'm almost always going to have the advantage there if i try to read him if i ever think the fact that he might get a touch on it then i'm going to have a hard time in those situations give me kind of cut fire off but it might still work out not too bad of a situation oh my what a shot from fire it's really a shot my first touches here play for the boost instead of the ball that's fine because you're not gonna do anything crazy with this ball if i can win the next one anyway now we have a really good extended amount of pressure here there we go ended up working really well there really good pass from gimmick but again that was a really good opportunity there to steal his boost instead of going for the ball diving in on the challenge what she would have wanted for me much better idea to take my time get the boost the windows there you know the resources down a little bit and fire wins the next challenge i'm in a better position with full boost because of it made him pop it there so i can just back off my my roll's done you make one the next challenge and fire is able to force the next ball above him which is perfect really good try he's gonna have one more touch on this so i'll just wait for his follow-up if he has a flip take my time it passes middle now off this nicely done really good job for gimmicks to be ready for that i'll play it all played all right good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs that was a really clean game though a lot of fun a lot of good plays in there see let's get into the next one team and keep it up let go let go all right a lot of the same players from last game i think only raid is different right spoon and double are the same play for the mid boost here firefight the fire push i'm gonna pop this to the corner play to myself wait for a touch here because that's not gonna do much for them really good attempt it's a good time to go for a solo play when i had no pass middle i had no one else that can really help me in a situation then you want to use your solo play mechanics to your advantage you make sure to have this play to fire fire i can maybe touch if not then it'll be my ball to go for should be okay i think yeah couldn't really see give me for a second there so i wasn't sure how to get back here you know wave that should get back a little bit faster should be fine tried to pass off the gimmick didn't quite get it through to him still a good attempt though drove into the ball pitted it up to the sky it's going to give him a good opportunity to do something with it now i can bait this out for fire make them flick or something it doesn't matter doesn't need to be anything too perfect just to force them to do something right don't give them too much space with uh no interruption to play it's a good block on the follow-up there let me get some pads here should be gimmick's ball good touch around me that's really smart there not even bother trying to fit to me he's going for the straight up beat on me there he's smart don't have any boosting situation i was gonna fake this make her panic a bit should be giving small now get some pads here moose is pretty low honestly pretty bad situation to be in right now but i took our time pass off to get me on the wall there good play down field good job to use each other there should be my ball first just gonna make him flick it to the corner almost sped it up just enough have that vehicle attempt if i could turn this keep it in one more touch over them would have been huge but it was very tough for him to actually get that i try to take my time again probably shouldn't flick to that one but it hasn't worked out too badly for us wait for the bounce down here oh the double there would have been a huge but it should be fine probably win these next couple challenges either way i can't throw this one away and that should be fires ball let's see done i'm gonna go back wall here we'll have everything covered in this scenario if you go back sorry i can follow this up try to beat him there as one guy back for a while it's gonna be an awkward spot for sure really good block from gimmick try to play it off the corner here make it weird for them again there's no real play here but to throw it away you make challenge well you get the back boost showing full boost now good fake from fire well done really good play from fire there i like that a lot a lot of time on the ball a lot of you know options on how he could shoot he decided to do nothing at all one for the soft touch the smart for play back boost here he's gonna play patient but my teammates are pushed up this ball gets banged back i want to be in a position where i can help out so now i can move up a little bit because fire died try that again so it should be my ball gotta get in the way of very unfortunate to be honest that that just dies right there very unfortunate yeah if i feel like it wasn't trying to 50 it that way specifically but the way he was taking the ball was always going to go like that so maybe i should have faked it because he didn't really have a good shot i didn't realize i was lost back for longer than i thought i was gonna have to be so it's a really good attempt right there really good idea to control that almost worked out nice pinch he's gonna be awkward now back i take the boost instead good touch so i'll just go for this there's no real reason not to it's never really going to be bad jimmy could probably challenge for me nice didn't want to throw it away better to let them have control create a play going downfield i can't really go for this quite yet a little bit risk yeah i don't know where it's going to go right ah that's super unfortunate it should still be okay there you may got no boost going back i didn't know that so the situation is actually worse than it looked like that should always be fine if he has boost there but obviously he didn't i didn't find that out till after good bump from them this could be really good for us fireplaces down to me good try try to pass the gimmick i like that the touch nice well done ends on a kickoff goal but sometimes that's what it takes well played though all right go two games for today i hope you guys enjoyed the video actually a lot of related goals in
