yo what's up guys we've been playing some games with aqua for today we are pretty high up on the leaderboard we're 6th right now in twos and we're 21st and three so we're actually pretty close to rank one in bullets so not sure what mode is gonna be queueing but we'll get into it should be some fun game to see how it goes all right we're going to sweat a game off the bat we got turbo and ajg so we got two pros full pro lobby here i haven't played against turbo on twos in a while i think he's playing more twos though these days good touch from turbo i say from awkward actually really awkward for me aux is very good very mechanical player you can create a lot of opportunity here's something very valuable about those uh very like mechanical players which obviously i would consider myself one of them i think that's one of the most important aspects of that though is that you can just create something out of nothing kind of like that wild card you can be getting destroyed in the game you can be destroyed in a series but if you have someone that's like mechanically very talented they could just turn up take over the game completely so i think it's very important that's why a lot of like the players that are more designed around like trying to be solid and trying to just rotate well are kind of becoming less common in pro scene but the game is very difficult it's always been a difficult game it's a hard one to be extremely consistent at i think it takes a lot of uh constant effort to keep improving but i still enjoy it so enjoy the competition trying to learn new things pretty fun for me should we go for a quick shot here shoot off back watch it here turbo up all i have to do is beat turbo there can't bump him in time but i can go back here shot wasn't fast enough from aqua but it was still enough to make his life difficult which is good try to pass middle is actually a bad choice akko wasn't gonna get enough spots actually help out with the pass to be a goal rather play well take advantage of this situation that was really good i've played awkward a long time but still very good player very fast player you can rely on them to be there most of the time that's something i like a lot into having someone that i know will be there for passes stuff like that it's very solid very fun to play with gonna kick off probably won't beat him to this but i could try to bump him off of it a challenge for him take my time here let me go down to the ground how to beat one on this i could block him would be good almost got the gold straight up would have been perfect just driving into that so i can rotate back quicker turbo touch isn't going to do much here if aqua just plays safe he's got to wait here i'm not going to [ __ ] him it's going to touch one more if he doesn't have the ball for free i can play it over one here watch the bump from turbo hit off the back wall just around him play to my open space to the left good challenge aqua should have pre-touched there not going to go here awkward might have been beat nice really good job i could have went how to bump turbo or try to hit it off the back wall around him but i just got dressed aqua's going to beat him in the solo play there got his boots which is good he's zero boost make a play here you pass left to me played off the back wall aqua she had free touch i think he might have thought i was going again tommy i got the demo though which is big behind me bomb from turbo not gonna be anything off of it though that's a really good bump get his boost here that means there's no one there to shoot he's awkward some time to deal with that and also kill the last man played off the wall here for aqua only way i could really pass that wall downfield any kind of shot and that's good i mean anything that makes them have to panic a bit i think is good there doesn't have to be a straight goal off of it it's more just making them be in an awkward situation it's a good demo my first touch hit off the back wall here around him let's say from turbo i'm going to play it back to aqua off our own corner i think this is a good play i should have won that every time keeps possession in our hands i shouldn't have jumped here i didn't think he had a solo play that doesn't mean more of a pass opportunity server has nothing here though no way it's gonna be cool should be back in time nice challenge for maka i jump to the wall here i hit one over him like a touch wait right here nice pass i played to open space over the mall aqua should have the ball for free and now 1v1 as well should be a goal good try i'm gonna fake here that i'm hitting it away off our back wall good touch from ajg is really good nicer one more touch would be perfect i pass it that's kind of funny i wonder if they get the gold just banged it too hard way too hard but fun game though against the next one stephen keep it up get back to my dubs let's see how it goes after last year we got forky and polo or pollo polo matcha i'll call him paulo for the sake of the video why not wait behind you okay i messed up out of my ariel but didn't work out terribly take my time here i thought something crazy i'm sorry i was i was doing too much i try to land backward get a flick not the not the right right idea there it's a good save though got from aqua to clean up let me go quick the fork it's actually really big probably messes up his control here unfortunately i got a bump i can still follow it ah not the touch i wanted i wanted to be like perfect flick i probably should just pass talk a little bit better gonna leave it it's wide wait middle here if you want to use me it's probably give me a shot though let's play it to the right the spot where i can't get dunked and it still keeps it in play a bit it's actually crazy no boost i got a pretty good challenge and almost the goal is pretty good nice gonna wait there's no real play here you're just trying to be annoying oh i was trying to get back and bump them a bit that's fine i don't have any anything really to do there but try to clear it my boost level isn't that high just keep on getting demoed that's okay classic it's a two's way and then whatever that is oh boy oh boy i love me some high level tv tv i do want it it's gonna fake oh lord wow i played to the back wall to myself i don't have enough boost to follow it though oh i do okay oh i faked porky that works i know i had enough boost to get there by enough have enough boost to beat 42 so he must have just confused himself by looking at me for too long ah that's really bad for me it's just pretty much impossible for me to get to that ball on time to beat the person facing it the problem is when you're facing it like this you have such a huge advantage and they get under his momentum coming toward i had to turn stop turn and everything the only way i could really get away with that is going back maybe i save it but it's gonna be very hard to save to make bad position to be in general a kickoff that goes like that really good demo there i'll go in for something crazy he's going for like a delayed musty should i pop it for him nice actually a really hard shot to take to be honest i had to come in quick i had to read a lot of confusion on the back wall i didn't know who was hitting it just trusted my instinct better to shoot it nice i'll go for a bump here instead of the ball then hit it away regardless to my teammate this might be bad now i don't know much abuse i'm just going to go for awkward here if it gets over me it's fine you should be back and boom not going to be in though i think yeah waiting for your touch mood can i challenge it though that's fine should be okay unless you get bumped the worst case scenario right left here you go solo i think i can't really like [ __ ] me on that so i'm playing for 50 at that point don't throw it away it's fine i just played as patient's possible which i have a touch here i'm just going to try to pop it over him now can't do much else played around the first guy so second guy has a harder job here now because of that now he kind of is forced to go backward same situation like a challenge from opponent though again i can't score that i'm mainly just trying to keep it in a lot of what twos and threes is just trying to keep it in the situations it's a good play for them good counter akko was getting mid boost just came a little bit too fast gotta kill him like a porky for him as well i just have a lot of time to shoot this now how to get a steal on it good idea but good job the demo there made him really awkward aqua all you have to do is win the 1v1 did a good job at it wait far right she passes it's going for solo that's fine see a challenge oh might be bad okay it's dead unless oh i almost got the perfect touch to keep it up nice you can stay on that maybe oh big miss from polo should be a goal i try so surprised he just drives past the ball for a bump there it's very interesting nice from aqua only bats about that is i didn't get the boost but he has it so he can make a play on this should i kill some time here he should go for me again maybe actually i'll go for him now play the fake should be in good save let's challenge quick fake jump on the wall let him panic a bit not a fake first it could be good actually could be bad now if aqua doesn't get us up that year she'll just get in the way not bad actually good 50 go straight back to him 50 i have to wait here all right it's gonna be really awkward on fork he has to jump right now hopefully aqua stay back if not it might be in okay good let's get a double save very hard situation to get out i have a pretty good job there don't let him touch it i think he's up ready patience good read as well on the situation are you messed up so a chance to make a play i'm gonna fake here first 50 mid should be cool it's really good play all right the games today hope you guys enjoyed it have
