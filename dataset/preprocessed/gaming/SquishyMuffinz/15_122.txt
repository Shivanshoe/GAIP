yo what's up guys gonna be solo queueing some 2 games for today let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see all right the first thing we got ourselves cam against messi and kinsei all right also have a little bit of a cold guys you could probably hear it so i hope it's not too annoying i hate when i can hear myself and it like sounds like this but i still wanted to record for you guys so yeah quick here let gonna be in the way this one more time keep control as well i missed the boost would have been a really good play actually i thought he got that bruce would have beat him to it yeah it's gonna be this funny game though it's a really good player playing here let him hit this away it should be fine where's he gets a flip just follow it up put it off the corner do you make sure to go baby made them double command at least which is pretty good i think in that situation makes them both waist boost really good dodge there unfortunately the team just got that boost but it's okay maybe we can get it over whatever one i'm glad my teammate waited though that's a good play or a play to make there that's back to me maybe all right let him go alone here now there was a window where he could have passed it to me maybe we could make a play of it but after he did it that's my i called i'll just go back pop that up let them follow ah unfortunate i thought my teammate would beat him to it and that'd be a pretty much free goal for us if you did that something i like to do a lot in threes playing on my team obviously my team is very fast so it works very well but in twos playing with people that aren't justin or garrett it's uh okay well i got landed on not always gonna work for sure but not a bad idea there i don't dislike that idea at all maybe you can finish it don't block it that's fine all right it's a little awkward here it's okay it's a very messy game so far to be honest i don't know what's happening i'm not gonna lie it's such a messy game none of that should have worked he went his last man back you shouldn't really do that too much like that aggressively in twos had he lost a challenge probably a goal against this almost 100 percent so for the bump i wanted to fake the second air double touch and go for the bump on him after i thought it was the right idea but i ended up missing it i made that again then pop that jump to the back wall here block all the angles should be okay let them flick this or something make a panic a bit again got around one wall another one he may should go here so fine he's racing the challenge find beta to touch a wall better headed away to me better on one again i have no boost though this is the only bad part about this now he did a good job to pick my boost there drop my teammate i'm gonna rotate why like really far opposite because most of the time the ball is going to come across after a situation like that make a panic a little fake challenge a challenge teammate should pass this to me maybe or just shoot if he can good job so that's like the joystick you want to give your teammate the pass just in case right because there's a chance that the guy might get back the last defender back if you give him that pass middle it makes it a lot harder on the defender if you just go back right away cuts down one less option he has to worry about so always make sure you're giving as many options as possible to your teammates in those situations oh i want to go for the pinch after that should be good for us here actually i'll be patient now though that away which is fine for us i can control this over two of them there we go good play there good play to control that we had a lot of time we used the well we got over both people hit that first flip close right so we're able to follow up the second one take this boost bait the flick here try to turn on this half flip should pass it to the left maybe it's fine i'll go for a bump here made him jump which is good more than enough it's going to kill their play shouldn't have moved up for that boost should have realized my team is going to go for it first touch here fake again make him throw it away fight to the left side let me go up teammates should have this i find that i get killed there it's actually better put back in a much better position take left mid here for touch there we go should be game i was the sweaty one was the twenty one but we got out we got the dubs what matters and i think we're probably like top 30 off that so it's pretty good pretty good i feel like a leaderboard real quick oh it wasn't even ssl so it was going to be a tough game no matter what it's not even a matter of him thinking he's playing bad he just might not be the same level as other people in the lobby to be honest um but let's look at the leaderboards look look so we're number three in threes right now we were number one not long ago and off that win right there we should be higher than 37 i think 2108 we're 30 34 34 right now not bad not bad not bad let's get into the next one so you can keep it up finish it off with back to back wins let's see how it goes all right we got ourselves kinsei against kx and expert this time see this goes another sweaty one very racist lobby's on right now try to play it around i mean let him touch this one i know he has an advantage there go for a flick good block from him about the whole net not a lot of options i had there keep it to myself here fit the middle the challenge at least he didn't lose it super hard he's gonna go for that last back yesterday at least a good challenge on and he did play patiently middle here don't really want an instagram for this it's going to be there first see this path to the ball is a lot better than her mine was obviously because behind the ball i have to go toward it there might get bumped here dave it's fine i don't care if it's that really it's not gonna do much no way you can score it again then i'm panicking a bit here you know it's away now good situation for us almost every time i'm gonna bait out his touch i'm just gonna stay here show presents make him hit it over me then i leave i'm gonna leave my teammate with a good situation every time at least to get a free challenge on it let him flick it again it's fine i didn't actually go for any of those balls really i'm just sitting there to show presents and it did enough to create a good opportunity for us every time play it off the wall make this one because it's a bad bounce gotta watch the bumps here likes to bump a lot nice another bump i was talking about let me go for a bump when i'm dribbling here so it doesn't have time see my teammate the ball now that's fine he's going to be there first i had to be careful hoping my teammate gets in the way and it stays in the way here get a block until i get in front again no boost here but it's fine if we just stay in the corner if i play the middle for my teammate now gonna wait a sec it's fine he had a little bit more time than he thought probably they just threw it away if you have time like that in the corners you obviously want to take it as much as you can right really a play there that was a good fake good job to use my time wisely there real quick break the first touch i have all that time and the ball see i picked my shot well and i did a good play there i think they should go it's fine i don't even need to jump into that to be honest no risk that's right i want to save should finish it maybe really good pass from kinsey to be honest i like that that's a good say from them though too i have to watch the demo there i backed out of the area was a little bit risky to go for take my time here tried to see if i can get him was like a mind game or something like i was gonna go for a jump and then like another flip after maybe but i faked the flip part he was ready for it he played all the angles properly play off the corner touch middle maybe trying to make like as many weird touches as possible see if i can throw them off they're doing a good job should be okay for a second here i gotta watch the shot ah it was a good shot honestly he had a lot of space like a lot of time to take the shot right so i'm guessing in my head that he was gonna go far post like up to that corner put it close though i wasn't ready for it hard to cover the the close end the far in a situation like that whenever all the time to take a shot over them pump them out as well good demo i have a lot of time here almost almost on hard work tried to go for the instant wave dash and shot it's fine i don't want to beat myself out there he's just playing to bait me out there for like i touch over me so the fact that i don't go for that's really good decent challenge he's doing the same thing that i was doing before just kind of driving into something like that's a very good thing to do a very safe option nice games are messy but they're not meant to be clean it's twos so kind of what like high level twos looks like now for some reason very like not random but just messy he's a lot of like adapting to weird stuff oh i not think might you know turn again but should be okay hopefully all right i had everything blocked pretty sure if it shot it couldn't really shoot that's why i didn't i'm trying to go for that quick aerial fake into like a flip reset so close both times i did it my first touch here you can't really do anything with this outside of like a double should be okay nice and for the bomb yeah too much too much pressure for him to deal with there in that situation i have a lot of time right as soon as i popped that up and i noticed that um expert was backing off that made it pretty much the 1v1 situation so as long as i get the bump on that guy there's no way expert can help out if it's too close to the net and it was so as well played uh good game in general there there's a lot of like weird stuff that happened to be honest but we'll take it let's begin it was a messy game uh i'm feeling a little bit like sick right now guys so like i said give me a pass on this video if i don't uh if i hadn't talked as much as i normally do or if i didn't play that great i'll try my best but i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night but every time those of you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all [Music] peace [Music] how could i trust you when you hurt me
