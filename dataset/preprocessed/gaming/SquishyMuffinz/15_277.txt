guys going to be queuing some more two today with torment should be some more games let's get into it let's see how it goes all right the first game planning is coveton and remade i don't know why you keep getting this map man i've had the players have so many times in the last few days so confused i think i have a dislike as well i'm going to do that again supposed to be behind me so i'm just going to bait it i don't know why i'm lagging by the way i'm sorry it looks a little bit bad told me to go behind me and they're both up for this so it should be fine oh i might actually had to go out of that who might have the challenge that's fine i'm gonna wait it's gonna be hard to shoot this i know that so i'll watch out the picture with him no way it's gonna work dude i tried to pinch it with it and then i bumped the other guy that was so stupid i can't believe that actually worked that's for sign it's one of 1700 but this is better these guys are solid if they're around 1700 they're really good seems they're fast we're gonna stay with that i'll just play off whatever he does here oh my kind of sauce with the authentic dribbles oh those back flip flicks are so good when they're close like that you can get it over them like instantly hit that off our wall i'm not gonna go for this for back left tried her to shoot on target nice towards just the finisher finishing off the shots that's a good save but these guys are getting back to everything but we're just capitalizing at the very end i messed up their fake a bit i got the kill all this boost is gone that's unfortunate that's fine though made him panic because he thought i had the beast probably let's see what he does so i'll throw a shot angle it's fine it's gonna be a free ball for tour i'm gonna go all the way back for this corner give it to our pass back option as well it's fine they can't really do much off that the balls pop too high towards the free follow nice i'm just gonna pop this yeah i had a feeling that'll work the fake jump it'd make them kind of panic and go higher than you needed to those are really good fakes they're going to try to block you every time you could just wait just telling you 1600 points right they're gonna ask us to forfeit everyone always does that i swear honestly if you want to reach like high mmr your best best like to earn it man it's gonna feel so much better if you earn it you don't want to be asking pros to forfeit for you i've seen a lot of people ask me can i score to say i scored one than forfeit earn it man i swear the feeling of earning is so much better than having to give it to you i want this guy to earn i want him to score a good rule there you go you scored one you earned it such a better feeling man i swear like doing things on your own without you know asking someone to help you with it or something i don't know like trying to get to a certain rank you don't want to have someone forfeit to help you along the way there if you get there yourself it's going to feel so much better that applies for a lot of things obviously but in this situation i i just brought it up because people ask me all the time the lower mmr people ask me a lot to uh to forfeit for them i was gonna try and tour for the double yeah this game's uh pretty well in our hands i'd say it's gonna be hard to throw at this point let's see if we can get a good goal or two let's see which was on the right i was gonna pass to him but this guy went right away swear this guy has to be a smurf right his account looks brand new i just want to see to my friend that's quite a tournament yeah his account's literally brand new so either he's from ps4 and he just got a steam account or the smurf account but either way these guys aren't bad at all for their rank and they definitely don't need this to own goal for them to get a goal that's fine i'm gonna just fake this maybe okay you went right away so i decided to 50. at the beach room he's gonna be low now nice should i kill him yeah i swear those little like single jumps to fake it's just like the noise the noise that it makes when you jump is enough to scare people to do something different like that all i did was single jump i could even be like a little one too it's enough to make people like react differently than they normally would that's something i've been throwing into my game here and there when i can like if the ball is an awkward spot where they're not looking at me like they can't see my car but they hear the jump they're gonna panic more like i'm jumping for it when i still have my position on the floor and they're gonna get a worse touch because of it oh that's actually almost nuts nice little skirt skirt around the ball that's nice from four hit it around him well it bounced good for me and i just had a free go after that what is the speed i was actually in too after a boost i tried to kill him if i can kill this guy's probably a goal for us wait he stopped only one wait a minute so i probably thought i was back okay no someone yeah it's all good no problem no problem yeah if i was playing i would have been back there it would have been fun obviously can we get 10 is it doable i'm gonna fake here all right should i control this yay we can get 10 i believe i wasn't even in i'll actually post out the new on cool all right we need to get the 10th because they forfeited but still a good first game let's get into the next you can keep it up let go let go all right we got a tough game playing against ghost and fields 15 man let's see how this goes i'm not sure who feels 15 man is but obviously it's higher player i know ghost is from the rival series he wasn't rs at some point the tag i recognize his name he plays a lot of rank too i play him quite a bit i'll try to take their boost take the other boost as well so there's gonna be no bits under half for at least the next eight seconds so we'll be in a good spot to get a go out of this maybe potentially if they mess up it's just gonna come back there we go that was good good set of pressure keeping a mental note of when that boost would come back that way we can starve it again kind of sweaty kind of nerdy double oh my towards feeling that i hit it again i'll roll back to him play this other boost it's good to secure your boost as well because now i know they're not gonna be able to push me in time here oh i was hoping that'd be a banger of a pinch i just let him hit it it's fine again it's gonna force the worst touch out only way tord doesn't deal with that is if it gets like the god flick like literally perfect top corner again i'm trying to just show presents to make him panic in a way give to our free ball i like to play threes as well kind of just get my team free possession try to control this towards not back yet so trying to kill time for should be fun i believe that's a bad flick could be scoreable nice all i could do is drive into i was hoping that'd be top corner the flick but i missed it they actually forfeited straight off the bat i don't even know if i should add that in i guess i will but uh yeah let's get into one more game since that one was way too short let's see how the next one goes all right let's give me another good game alpha kept and ghost this time so it goes from the last game and alpha kappa played him previously with torment so we'll see he's a very solid player of course we'll see what can be done and play to the wall i can stay on it he's gonna pressure him make it awkward and get his boost as well nice and tour good speed he knows i like to go for the little extra mini touches it messes them up quite a bit i should have waited wait that works somehow i didn't kill him i'm just gonna go back at some pads it should be easy for tor 1v1 i've seen him squirties on the fennick oh sorry let's get a kill what's up at his teammate try to help him out of course should have this i think it should be fun didn't get the touch i wanted but it's all good torah's ready for it ready to help me out nice there was no boost that was a really good challenge though it's fun it's gonna be hard to save that's a shot place the far post there's no way i could save that would have been fine let's just spill that into a good spot for the shot but it was good i've torn a turn there once you saw me getting bumped a lot of time to come back anyway only one goal you have to get a second you know twos is kind of unpredictable in a way it's never really over how to make it as awkward as possible take his boost nice try to put that in the hardest possible spot for them to deal with when it's like tight to the wall like that you're only stuck in goal you can't really get the best touch i know that so i tend to put it there a lot when i can because if i see so if i see no one on the backboard there it's like easily the best play to make is just to make it stuck to the wall i couldn't save it i thought maybe torpy back but it was a good shot thanks for watching there or was i cheater i don't remember but look like you got stuck on their half so i end up challenging i figured he'd be back a little earlier got it back though i definitely could have saved the other one that was my fault i should have been more aware of the situation i was just a little distracted shot is 50 on that works can't get their boost but that's fine i can go back get full try to get in a position to help out follow up here it's fine i full boost torque can go first i'll get behind him just to show him i want him to go first play it toward him actually could be good for us here i'll stay middle this could definitely lead to a goal in a sec yeah the reason why i knew that was was because i had full boost middle so i can cover any middle option if the ball bounces weirdly for them you know they're gonna obviously be in an awkward situation have to get a bad touch middle we have both options covered so like that counter is pretty much as perfect as it gets with every option covered that's why i was pretty confident vehicle want to always try to like have full boost in a spot where it'll help your team in whatever situation it is really it's pretty much the main goal any any team based game mode in this game twos threes try to just be in a spot where you can follow up whatever your team's about to do kind of secure that it does end up being a goal by being in the right position double maybe close tell a tor at that boost just trying to bait out the touch for him don't even need to throw myself away there as long as he gives toy free ball that's all i really need to do try to sit off the wall be as annoying as possible it's gonna probably try to dribble that that's fine can i have full boost back here so chances of him really getting anything when tours on backward it's very low towards the mist like pretty badly flat to every vehicle try to bump them good save should be free though good job legendary clean up goals also i'm working on a couple training packs probably two training packs one for offense one for defense um and i'll be releasing those in videos and just showing you guys how you're supposed to take each shot and they're gonna be really good practice they're all gonna be high level packs like it's not gonna be any low level packs um like super simple stuff if you guys want me to make a super simple pack i can just let me know after i release those of course trying to get in the way i messed up my flick there i'm not playing too great this game but i still have the lead even though they scored there that's my fault not the flick i wanted could have even been a goal for us if i didn't mess that up yeah i'm playing pretty dumb one lighting i don't know why i'm being distracted i've never really gotten distracted when i'm recording but i feel like i'm like not paying as much attention as i should like right there i wasn't looking at my monitor on the cheats i kind of just drove too far forward all right focus mode focus mode finish off on a on a win here around him can he go up i might mess this up that's fine i just want to see if he does with that actually good that he missed let him touch boost might come back yeah it's actually really good could definitely be a goal here could also easily be a goal against us wait this could be good it could be a counter depending on what tour does the flip nice good finish i was watching the the flip there never be too sure might miss this i have to boost it's gonna be pretty easy one going for tour to deal with i think should be fine round one i was hoping that would be better isn't it for the bump probably so you can do it's fun i wanted to wait for the challenge got another good challenge for tour i was trying to help him out there again they're just trying to dribble every ball pretty much normally what happens in twos especially you know t's people just try to dribble like this constantly i was trying to put myself in spots where i can react to that nice that challenge we almost faked them they're so sorry right now like they're bound to get scored on really soon here nice they're gonna probably have boost now at this point but as long as we can keep on pressuring them here we'll be good i'd say overall we have like way more shots than them put them in harder spots take this boost again they're going to be in a really bad spot because he's going to waste the rest of his boost here tomorrow i can have a free free challenge like a follow maybe a shot here i'm lucky you got back to that nice challenge good aggression since i headed over him i'm gonna wait for my chance here a room maybe a shot the finish the janitor comes through sweeps up the goals my specialty leaving the dirt in front of the net for someone to sweep up all right pretty solid games hope you guys enjoyed today's video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this
