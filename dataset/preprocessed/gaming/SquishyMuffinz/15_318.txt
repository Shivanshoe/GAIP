up guys in the last video we finished off at 4 to 10 matches played 693 m are almost up to 700 which i think is around gold platinum around there so pretty so hopefully we can get some hiring khalaby this video people that are more ready for the passes and stuff like that but yeah let's get into the games for today and hopefully we can get two more waves let's go alright so already the MMR zittle lobby seemed a lot higher than we've been getting we were getting around like high two hundred to low three hundred this is all high 300 low four hundred so already getting better and better which is what I like to see hopefully my teammates are nuts when I cheat here click the mid boost from them the guy behind me gonna have no boost I'll challenge for them saying go for it alright man going for I'm leaving for my teammate you should have that again maybe they're there for that I'm gonna take the boost my team's nuts go for a kill again we have a full time defender he's afk never mind ok beat that guy got around another one and that should go middle and again if my teammates trusted me on that touch look at the shot that he would have had to leave that there my teammates are both kind of a weird position I think one of my teammates is still afk so that's a little bit unlucky on my part literally just afk I don't know how we're gonna do this to b3 we just need one goal and hope for the best at that point but I hope he comes back that's just my luck though okay he's back I think kind of looks like it hit it around this guy as well I made this out the backboard now so you're both gonna miss that for sure it's up to my teammate to hit nice let's make the follow-up again too far back like look how offensive he's playing he should be around Roderick you for that ball and you can come in and get a free goal good job hold on that's the main thing I'm seeing that's the biggest issue honestly if they're positioning tighter together with their team and closer they'd be there for all these shots it's probably because they're not managing their boost properly it could be a mixture of that and just simply not knowing where to be but if you manage your boost properly you should always be able to stay around the middle to help out with your team they push forward and fake this guy maybe okay nevermind I also can't fake low ranked player is that easy one thing I've noticed my time doing you see a chart of the fake low ranked players and a player can knows all the possibilities of the game should I play this middle here close I'm gonna back off let magnet go for this gonna flow boost like a turn yeah it's fine over me so I could back off teammate should have a free ball nicely done again I have one full time defender which makes this really awkward for me I'm really not used to that idea to kill you you can create a lot of opportunities with demos and stuff but you don't want to like overly demo of course tea minute with a shot maybe a nice - job all right Megan it was a FK for a little bit at the beginning of the game but you know he's coming through some messed up matchup his name is Zach centering prison Mike should be playing with us I'm surprised people will still think that I'm like good I'm not like scoring a lot but I guess I'm doing things that people in this my card I still be doing but I'm just trying to create as many plays as possible obviously makes it more fair that I can't score obviously as well nice I don't let my teammate go again this is where you should be if what my team is here in front of me I should be right here because why she's gonna happen if the ball gets touched wherever it goes for this next I can play off of it making the turn when you should have rotated so I'm gonna wait okay now he left so I can go but look I can get involved in a place so easily because I'm already pushed up there Tim I should go cuz I'm already kind of rotating you know there we go I'm right here and I can keep this ball in play I was if I just off the backboard hard or my teammates will do that for this probably gonna run see they're both of gnarnia again and then he misses that ball because he's not pushed up with the team and that's that's the problem with your teammates don't often so you gotta be there to help get it around him I'll go for your demo here killed one oh no he left out almost squirt carry good oh no he made Chyna leave the game I'm sorry Chyna I'm simply trying to get some double use over here get kills huge kills nice magna finish it off let's go huge demos did my teammates saw I was demoing he's like I'm gonna go demos wolf so I like to see John John blood see Magnum is making a lot of weird turns in the corner there to you especially after seeing that the only two people on the field got killed like honestly like it's not even a mechanical thing a lot of these players just don't have a good read of how the game works yet so your simple as that is low ranks nothing you can't really like criticize them too hard because again they haven't seen a lot of these situations that hiring players would have seen thousands of thousands of times so nothing you can really criticize over it no please don't go in off of that okay that's fine if it goes in off of him let's try my best not to score over here stop the back these guys pretty much over though good start to this this video are keeping played actually really good I thought I mean obviously they made some mistakes and obviously they're not rotating perfectly because they're still sitting in goal when people are on offense but much better then the last few games I think play middle let's go magnet see what John blood does here cross map I don't want to score though off the backboard come on team finish at my inner urge and wants me to score those but I've made a pact no goals till grand champ I can't I can't go against it all right so those are all silver threes all there were silver threes and I'm Way above that right now so we're up to 700 em are already we're over 700 746 and we have one more game for today hopefully we can win it and get up to maybe 800 mm are ready let's go all right you're playing all 550 Plus and more players this should be better it should definitely be better get it touch to control okay I'll try my best not to actually dump it in again want to say around middle here but my teammates are push but look look at this position I'm in now should I hit this up a down curve make it really awkward for them I'll leave that for my teammate should be behind me well done already rotations are already better you could tell I started do those mechanical misses like right there / 1 / - I should go middle as well so I'll back off a lot of the lobby went out for that I gave it to the right corner I'll try to play this off the corner again my teammates are still behind me so I shot to get in a spot where they can get it there works close enough there push this over one guy a little bad day I can grab the beus and go for a demo nice job there we go as a good play nice one nice one we got it over one one fair demo and all my team got to do is get the shot over the last not the craziest shot but that's all we needed so all I needed was a good finish I'm gonna say defending he said I got it take the corner boost see my teammate goes first I'm playing behind a mirror so I can follow this touch immediately put out the corner and leave it I could go for a double obviously if I was trying to score but trying to leave it for a shot we're way behind you I'm gonna go for this you're gonna beat me to that I can grab the though I already landed here I trust my team hopefully they don't let me down all right they let me down but it's okay it's okay high rank lobbies no problem at all going for that quarter because the team is gonna have a clear out of that ten out of ten times but obviously people still aren't fully comfortable with mechanics of the game and stuff like that and also it would give them an option if I'm up there for that corner boost I'm like a redirect option don't want to pass me got a killing one kill on two [Music] beat him to the ball up that up I should be a goal I've trust my team so Justin though alright a little bit less less and less each time I say that a little bit of my trust disappears but still there you put a bump this guy know oh my god are you kidding me beyond gold what do I do that's not my fault okay I feel like own goals we could disallow on what was like that's not on me at that point cuz what if I don't know I I didn't think about that like what if someone washing the series just like tries to own-goal just do it this year okay well if it's a known goal well disallow like it like it doesn't it doesn't matter cuz we can't be like scoring on goals to counteract the holes yeah I mean let me know what you guys think that that obviously was my fault at all and trying to pass it and create a play and they're the ones that that hold it so I'd like to know what you guys think about that that's the first time it happened obviously I knew it was gonna happen at some point because there's gonna be times where you accidentally 50/50 you go straight in stuff like that I never know what you guys think for now I'll I'll just humble to counteract it I guess my teammates of course ready for that oh my gosh alright hold on I'm gonna play it to their side and then I'll play back at home goal just to make it even for now cuz I don't know what to do that's not a way to actually make it even both well we'll keep track that it was in a home call I just want a home goal dude why am i team playing solid now like they're actually doing the ball please don't save that dude oh my god hold on Oh monk I did I'm there at a harder time trying to on ball all right and then see why does he miss the ball they touch but what I thought should they say everything dude okay I got I got I got okay okay okay hold on hold on hold on actually another to play the game because I'm trying to uncle Stokes I feel bad about this goal to be scored okay there we go we back me back we're even now or even so Michael is the count will cancel alone for now but I want you guys to let me know down below what you'd rather me do when we accidentally score the only fair way to do it for now though my name is off the backboard should create a chance for my team push popper nice at the beach from him good one in the air there dress the socks imma play this middle dumb I know my teammates are still both on our half maybe scared that I was gonna only pull again which is reasonable all right can you probably should be going for the ball it's such was just gonna be off the backboard again I went just in case like I would give but he didn't yeah another idea to go for the boost there I can get a kill as well on the way back they both faked each other out put it middle I tried to fight as slow as I possibly could I don't understand like when I was trying to own goal don't know what's a goal when I was trying on well they're saving everything absolutely everything and now that I'm not trying to touch the ball toward them they can't hit the ball again it's so weird okay defending we got this I believe I shan't apply this left my goal to count but rules are rules let's go push pop partner set it off the corner I went for the demo right away good finish you finish nicely done that is what I like to see I might call defending so he goes and that should be game over there we go all right so yeah let me know down below guys what do you want me to do if I accidentally score like in this game where they own gold but let me know how you want me to deal with that I'm gonna just leave it and doesn't matter or if you want me to own gold make it even so I don't want to upset my teammates I'm happy I didn't get upset it's one way to make it fair though I think right now but if you guys are cool with me just leaving me in Knott County like obviously now if you check the stats it's gonna say that have a goal but you have to remember that I wasn't trying to score the goal was just you know something that they did backs it but yeah not too bad at all we got another way we're gonna lost one game so far in the series which is pretty good considering how hard this can be at times not bad at all ready up to almost 800 mm all right we're at 796 after six matches played pretty pretty solid yeah those are all Gold's in that Lobby a straight and higher and higher Ivy's have a wonderful day or night
