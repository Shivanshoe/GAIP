yo what's up guys gonna be playing some more rank today with ajax and gimmick and uh this is just to carry over from the last few if you guys didn't watch the last video go watch it because these dudes we're sniping gimmick while you're streaming and uh running into them again so it's pretty much gonna be like a best of five series probably by the end of all this yeah 100 they're going to play better this game no doubt in my mind we won the last one against them but i see them playing much better this time there's a lot of double commits on both sides it's just sloppy in general i'm gonna go for them i don't really know what's happening i was so confused nice from tour that was a good uh job to slow down there just gonna leave that if i can grab their boost as long as my teammates don't lose a big challenge here we'll be fine it's actually good for us too because if we do get a counter here they're gonna be looking for that back piece probably it's gonna make it awkward right now it's ready to spawn so it doesn't really matter but it's good on the way back if you can't take a boost like that to take that boost because you never know when you'll be on a counter and they'll need that base right good touch from gimmick oh my bum i should be a little bit closer but obviously heinz says 20 20. it's hard to know that that's going to happen so perfectly what a touch from gimmick try to pass it back interesting demo it's pretty useless honestly because i was falling down but i'll take it just spawn me back this could be rough for us there if i could control this would be good nice challenge it's really good to control those balls around the corner honestly it's always so awkward for the defense it's a good thing to try to practice too panicked on that which is good oh could have a much better shot what a challenge holy you give me so good he's got such a good vision of the game i feel like like during my time teaming with him the one thing i noticed is his ability to read the game and what's gonna happen next is honestly better than anyone i swear to god like him on just challenges is so is so good for some reason his challenges were always insane like he just knew what people were doing always i was gonna block him turbo but he has no boost to follow you got dribble that's a really weird touch i wasn't expecting it but it worked actually good it's gonna fake try to make him hit the ball to me i can't really follow this hopefully someone messes it up awesome vehicle yeah i couldn't get a good follow-up touch on that because how awkward it was so i was really down to just hoping turbo made a bad touch snatch was just really fast and high at the ceiling so it made a ajax miss there nice touch from gimmick close all right i got to try to defend this smart because my teammates aren't back yet might actually be in shout out for that there we go baited them all in with a touch to the ceiling and then really good double jump to beat torment i think it was i can see them winning this game or the next one there i i doubt we went all these against these guys oh my god you're so you're so late to that that's actually crazy what the heck i was expecting to be in the air i would have beat him if you actually went high for it just waited low he's going to be there probably this is interesting interesting audrey was driving me in the bull just throw the ball away you can hit that to the wall i'm gonna let ajax get i didn't send you a boost really it's not even that bad for us have you double committed there nice from gimmick i like the bump there that's really a bump for me to actually just no boost anyway if i could just block this would be good nice 250s back to back that's pretty good from us behind gimmick here follow up this next touch i don't really need to go for this no reason to just panic give ajax a ball now i get challenges for gimmick if it's it's over me it's fine honestly most cases unless he gets a donkey or something pumped both and i got the goal first you oh my the two bumps actually got a cycle what the heck that's really good again gimmick's ability to read that i was going to do that it's kind of crazy to me like obviously the bumps were big there but the fact that he was there to shoot that is so nuts to me obviously it helps that he knows what i want to do a lot of the time because we've played together for so long but the i don't know it's just crazy like he's always been so good everything stuff i had a fakey it's fun no booster i get a shake i need to pass it really better to make them hit the ball back to my team than to force the player that i don't really need to force at all i got another win under our belt against the same same squad let's get points jumps as well and we'll probably play them again i assume they'll keep keying so that'll be the last game of the video be another sweaty match up against them so you can go 2-0 again or actually it'll be three in a row if you beat them in the next game so let's see if we get the back to back to back here but i think they're going to do better and probably win the next but let's get into it let's see how it goes all right playing against the same team as i thought we would they're the highest mmr people on right now obviously three other pro players so we'll see how it goes i have no boost behind here that should be ajax bought a challenge a little bit off i'm just gonna wait and go all i really can do i doubt they go for a shot straight off the bat here those are very awkward because the bumps the ajax take huge beat [Music] oh almost a 50. almost what we needed nice patience i have no boost here i try to kill time for my team oh good idea again your second jump to get down to the ground killed some time for us it's pretty close my gosh what is happening what nice we'll definitely take that very interesting lucky mikko take my left i'll be behind ajax your vsb but i gotta watch the demo turbo lifts a demo on the way back smart way to play there you guys actually get 50 i doubt they can get anything good out of that you have to wait i missed kind of messed up tournament by faking that and it's gonna be wide open probably almost i feel like my teammates are so confused they just weren't ready you know for demos killed one close almost placed it oh wait it worked that's fine i'll take the boost there we go we'll definitely take that ajax a little further back i saw him far back so i decided his turn that was a huge b to b three people with one touch that was huge been some fun games though good practice for sure it'd be really tough on ajax yeah that's that's a super tough position to be in he was kind of stuck flat footed on the goal line and you gotta kind of hope like whoever shooting messes up you almost did honestly but it's really good from them to create that opportunity gotta wait here a challenge close i'm just gonna go straight back i don't have any boost so to try to just be in a position i can help out in some way nice challenge for gimmick again iq on the challenges man it's too good huge try to follow that's good for us honestly let me go for the boost and just leave ajax should have this that's gonna be behind him pop a high for him my gimmick have that mid boost after probably go back and grab it i don't want to go for this quite yeah wait for his touch it's fine i shouldn't be up for this probably yeah i realized a little bit late that ajax went i honestly thought it was them that's why i went so quick too i tried to beat him i didn't think ajax was was waiting up there that's on me let's probably have a boom here should be fine nice even though shots are really good back there problem with it is that it just takes away too long to get to the net so gimmick has so much time to react to it even though it's a really good shot wow the ajax stuck on each other try to stay on this i could fake him that'd be good there i mean there's not really much i can do in a situation it's kind of tough nice it should be tough for missed huge read from gimmick did you actually go for this yeah honestly i guess one the last few times me and ajax not being on the same same page i keep not expecting to be waiting up field for some stuff and keep on cutting them off in weird weird spots because of it nice oh really close good try i don't think you can get the it's like i think you got bumped or something oh we'll take that definitely take that i go first i think we went together again we did yeah we're just not on the same page this game at all there i'm trying to just help him so he'll be on the backboard able to save anything and trying to help him out pretty much but oh close it's obviously impossible to know what i want to do because we don't have comms but you know how it is it happens like that like they both just forced that ball they both didn't need to go for only one of them did but just keeps happening it happens to be ajax every time just unlucky are they messing each other up nice so i get one more here i didn't realize they're they're both in such like pushed up spots i wouldn't have aggressed the same way but it's all good yeah all the goals are kind of just i was getting stuck on like the retreat and it's gonna happen i'm just gonna eventually do the game to a pro team like three pro players gonna obviously happen but definitely gonna win that game it was just three defensive mistakes where you kind of got caught up like there was gimmick and ajax was mean ajax twice that game as well so we're just kind of not not reading each other too well but yeah either way we played really well i think and uh you know obviously it's always gonna be tough games we went two and one against that team ajax is done it's not gonna be able to play anymore but uh yeah it's pretty much like a six-man series that never ended because you didn't get to play the the finishing game but yeah either way fun games all around hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or a night out of time you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys all in the next one i love [Music] y'all you
