yo what's up guys gonna be playing some threesome today with gyro and gimmick should be some good games let's get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got ourselves alpha cap moon and torment for the first game here see how this goes guys we got the championship coming up as well on sunday if we win that final we'll win the the whole season so that's sick pretty cool made top two guaranteed for the whole season pretty good first season with the boys hopefully we can end off with a a window finish off the right way that's where we want to be anything less than a win we're not going to be satisfied i'm sure they're grounded for that glad we have that to look forward to but then after that give me nothing for a while so i can get back to recording like i normally do for you guys and uh get back on track with my youtube stuff make sure i'm uploading as consistently as i want to be because i know before i haven't been able to the last little bit even though i wanted to it's been really busy with all the rlcs x stuff and even other stuff going on so i hope you guys have been okay with me having a little bit of trouble being super consistent with my uploads but yeah i cut out there a little bit i didn't realize that if i got beat there it would have been bad so i probably should have played it in a better way a safer way i honestly didn't think there was any way it could go badly shot them down they pass from gimmick yeah i just feel like when the season's on there i have to focus really hard all the time and um i don't really leave myself a lot of time to have fun you know i care so much about just trying to to win and practice as much as i can gotta go back here good beat from gyro play back wall i'll just go down to the boost here see what happens should be okay for gimmick i'll get one more touch should be good because we win the next touch most of the time same with this one play to the corner instead of going for a shot shot's never really going to get us the goal there so i'm playing for the the pressure sustained pressure over the shot which is smarter in most cases let's do a demo almost really counter as well should be gyro's always controlling it's a good idea all right pass through and back wall you're trying to play i like that good idea it's a good save what have any boost here i just gotta bait it bump him as well after the fact try pass the gyro here good cut i'm trying to leave this going to bump gimmick but for touch past middle good shot well done you'd have to be there and be ready for that it's all played from jail good shot good shot i always get a pass mid on those when you have time you have a little bit of space use it wisely normally feed it to that forward it's not gonna do anything a pass can cause a lot of pressure there to be created there very very tough situation for me to get out of 1v2 for a while very very tough spot actually had a free shot at first i had to be ready for that and then after that he passed it really quick shot too quick for me to get back to as well but so if you hear my dog in the background by the way as well not sure what he's barking at should be okay nice touches if you want more pinch here can we go yeah thor's gonna have a touch so i should wait be to him on that which is really good cause a lot of pressure here try i'm just gonna play this high i don't want to play an easy play for him there we go we gotta go out of it as well much smarter to play that higher than to play a shot into them or to play it simply back wall because there had been a guy there there's a guy just waiting for the big clear playing it higher without a reach of both of them that's what you want to do there try to pass it back that's a good idea i like those little mini passing plays like that i'm gonna fake this i'm gonna make him panic again try to just make him panic that's about to get out of it we gotta go well pretty well so far oh he stole it no way he stole it he was always so good at sealing those i don't know why i don't know what it is he has a talent for stealing those good first game though let's get into the next one see we can keep it up get back-to-back dubs on the day get into it let's see how it goes all right for last name we got torment uh tattoo weep and i'm broken think that you say that i'll put it down field see what happens off the wall here that's from gimmick good job good start good pressure there jeffy get me to be ready for that it's only a bad play like it's a good touch up the wall for teammates ready it's really bad if teammates are not ready so good on gimmick to make that not a mistake i know it's a good play to make but if your teammate's not there it just looks awful you just pass the other team the ball one more touch here there's some other way across here wait underneath him in case he messes up gonna keep in i'm just gonna sit at midfield now and react to whatever happens here i'm not gonna be able to be close enough for that i can go for this pop it through the ceiling uh i'm surprised i thought jar would be underneath me i like doing that pop a lot that's a really good one to do i feel like because no one's close midfield gives wherever's under your free ball you don't really lose much it's not like a dangerous thing i'll be into i'll tell you one more here i was hoping to play middle guys behind me there i missed read where he was maybe he wanted me to debate it i'm not sure wow i didn't block it i'm also surprised i'm very surprised torment goes for this to be honest because i have like full control of the ball pretty much it's very unlucky to be honest i don't block that very very weird thing for him to go for my theme i feel like i have that like 99 out of 100 times it's blocked i don't know why it wasn't blocked to be honest i honestly thought it was blocked very weird thing to go for though behind you let me go all the way back i played a pie it's really weird for him to get a good touch he actually got a good pinch on him good touch from him maybe middle generously i don't know that around two maybe shot close please just keeping it in which is smart nice good shopping those touches off the corner really good if someone's there the corner and the wall makes you really awkward good to go for that second ball though how about my team don't give him a free possession there that starts the pressure early on and it's worth even if you don't have boost try to play opposite corner here i'm doing a lot more than any two trying to just instead of going for shots when there's two back playing to corners more because it suffocates him a lot more makes it a lot tougher i save wait for the bounces here ah miss red is touched i tried to dunk him i was a little late to the actual dunk good there it's actually just in oh my gosh heating up go back left here i think as soon as the championship is done by the way guys i'm gonna try to get around to figuring out if i can do the road to supersonic legend series i'm not sure if i can yet i want to figure that out talk to someone at sonics make sure i'm not gonna get in trouble for it and get around to doing it then i'll get mid right boost here but yeah i'm really looking forward to doing that that series again you guys we'll figure out how i want to do it when the time comes let's be back here full let's see if we jump him i made it so weird for him to do anything not gonna lie i had the high block from the start he had to go low and then you have to go high again i don't think i could read this i missed oh my he missed you he's gonna miss too isn't he i didn't what's blocking that's actually a good shot i thought he's gonna play it middle not gonna lie but he went for the solo play instead i should have probably expected that as no one really passes and ranked to be honest but uh play a lot of pro matches lately and everyone passes everything feels like from those angles no one really plays it around they have a guy mid i get at least against g2 i should say i'm playing g2 that those three series screaming them quite a bit lately they're very um very pass heavy oh we might lose we might lose we'll see i'm losing focus a little bit should be fine there's no way they go off this it's impossible everything blocks one guy ground one guy back wall all you do is wait for a shot they played it pretty well though that was the best way they could have played it to maybe gotta go out of it but even then we have one guy covering the entire low part of the net an entire high part of the net even if we both go there there's no way there's no way yeah good game there you played really well if you guys want to follow me on twitter by the way his twitter link will be down below in the description and uh yeah he's been playing a lot of videos with me lately so i'm gonna give a little shout out and um yeah he's still insane so very very talented player uh i hope you guys
