yo what's up guys so for today's video we're gonna be talking about a few things we got ourselves this brand new decal which in my opinion might be up there in conversation for the best decal in the game i honestly really do love this decal it's called stipple gate i've played quite a bit with it already it's super clean in game it's the closest thing to getting your car full black on a decal i'm pretty sure outside of like the the one that's like a suit the black tie one uh but this one is super super clean it's called simple gate i'm pretty sure you do end up finding it through blueprints i'm not 100 sure on that but i think so so you guys can definitely get your hands on this pretty easily uh but yeah we're playing some games with it for today also guys i got the brand new ps5 controller early i will be trying it out for today's video it's been feeling really good i've been training with it in free play quite a bit and it does feel really good the sticks are super nice the triggers l2 r2 are super nice um everything about it feels really good for me the one thing that i'm not sure if i'll get used to is the way that the circle x square triangle buttons feel they're slightly more rounded than the ps4 version which because i fat finger my uh my buttons which means that my thumb presses all four of those buttons um it does make it harder for me to reach square from circle but if you don't hold your controller like i do then you should be fine and you should really enjoy this controller because honestly there's no other issues with it that i've found so far but you guys for today because we're testing out the controller i'm going to be queuing all three game modes so we get a game as quick as possible so whatever we get we'll play hopefully we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we found a twos game super quick here we got ourselves turtle against horizon and airplane which i know who airplane which is old friend of mine from ps4 so it's going to be a tough game he's solid 100 percent very good mind game to start it off teammate was in a really tough spot there not much you can do in a situation if you don't cheat on kickoff in 2v2 there's always that that chance that the person who does cheat will end up getting that 1v1 situation on you right you gotta definitely watch out for that he's up again i'll let him hit it be fine he's gonna have that one more time i have to wait just in case try to go for the bump here there we go good bump not a whole lot he could do again i waited for that guy and i was on the back wall to miss and because he missed that it opened me up for that 1v1 situation right so a lot of what twos is as you guys probably saw in my last video where i played against i think it was first killing turoko or first killing atomic sorry um it's a lot of just those 1p1 situations over and over again you don't want to leave your teammate in those situations too often because more often than not especially playing as good players they will convert so that's something you have to definitely try to minimize when you're playing twos try to get the 50 there that'd be good for my teammate to follow up most likely i'm not gonna go for this see the solo play and again tough situation for them to defend so you want to just wait try to bait out the flick here make them do something slow that is play going forward it doesn't really matter here what we do as long as it doesn't get over me too hard teammates should have the follow-up touch should be fine it's a good pinch for us i'm just gonna pre-jump this why not there's a chance maybe we can dunk him or get a bump on him or something we gotta bump on the other player instead so it works me pre-jumping that it does create a lot of pressure in that situation because if i just wait on the ground there's a lot of time a lot of freedom with the ball but me pre-jumping that really makes it a lot tougher on him there's very few options on the back wall going forward there i'm gonna fake this should i get a good 50 on him staying on the ball here would be huge it's not bad it's a good flick from him should be fine though wait for horizons touch here let him hit that because again i know i could see the other player there's no danger in that i'm just going to backflip the stain goal try to hold on to some boost here goodbye for my teammate i'm backflipping pretty often right now this controller i don't know why i don't even think my dodge is on it's that low it's not it's normal i'm just not used to how the sticks feel yet but the sticks do feel really good i'm not gonna lie to you but it is a lot different than ps4 so i'm putting a different amount of pressure and it is leading to some mistakes i obviously don't make normally but it's all right it's not doing bad at all for one of the first games with this controller doesn't feel bad by any means especially when normally when i get a ps4 controller it takes quite a while for me to get used to it so can't be too upset when it takes a bit almost the the perfect angle on that double good dunk my teammate could be risky for a second year because of the bump attempt it's really a bump attempt from him got the kill should be open there we go i was hunting for the demo on one of them there because i figured worst case scenario my team gets at least a 50 to the wall and he ended up winning the challenge really hard so that's obviously the best case scenario when you get that demo shot a challenge for my teammate gonna be easy for him now i'm gonna toss one on goal see what he does good dribble i'm just gonna bait this out i don't need to go made it for my teammate he threw it away a little bit so it's fine played that wall should be easy for my teammate again nice touchdown field get some pads here gotta watch out for the demo i heard one behind me this now becomes a little bit awkward because we don't have a lot of boost go to my teammate to try to leave that for me try to leave the boots for me but i got taken it was a good idea though to be mindful of where everybody is i'm gonna try to go for this try to beat him to the ceiling i gotta go for the shot straight up because if i can get that beat to the ceiling plop straight down in front of the goal teammate's gonna be there most of the time so it's a really good finish for my teammate good job to be there and uh much better much better second half of this game so far all right won't be one for a little bit here you mess up a touch i just try to go for this quick as i could i couldn't though because of the demo and i sometimes just had the cookie crumbles maybe i could have pre-jumped super early try to get over the demo try to just hover a little bit over the ground so i get over the demo and then get the ball but really tough spot to be in it's really all down to that guy if he gets his demo or not if he doesn't i probably saved that because the the dribble touch was messed up a little bit get rid of one he's gonna hit that back down to my teammate oh but he's getting bumped he's getting harassed definitely makes situation awkward but he got out of it put it all into my boost here behind also a little bit input laggy to the controller right now because i have to set it up to your big picture i don't think there's actually any proper controller support yet for this controller because it's not actually out yet so yeah i have to set up your big picture on steam which i'm pretty sure does cause some input lag which i'll just go for my teammate try to go from again because he is awkward he should have been back in goal probably but it should be fine shouldn't be too dangerous i went right away but that'll work for us there we go so they obviously have to be a little bit panicky there when there's like only a few seconds left but i know worst case scenario if i drop that ball just to the tip of my hood even if he dunks me super well that's not going to go in most likely because the angle i have on the ball so it's not bad at all if he just full rushes that it's honestly better for us so not bad at all one of the first games with the ps5 controller i actually really do like how it feels it's a matter of getting used to the fat fingering for me because of the distance between the circle and square feels a little bit larger i think it might be because the the actual buttons itself are more spherical i think that's the right word for it the button itself just feels a lot different than the ps4 buttons so it's something that i'll get used to with time i'm not sure if i'm gonna stick with this controller full time honestly uh might be slightly better on ps4 controller obviously because i have so much more experience with it but we'll see we gotta give it some more time too small of a sample size to base it off of obviously only a few games played like two or three games on it so far so yeah we'll get into the next game see if we can get back-to-back dubs for today but this decal feels super clean guys definitely try to get your hands on it all right for the last game we got a sweaty threes game oh my we got toroko aj and justin capp on the other team we have adverse and delta on our team there's gonna be mad sweaty you could just you could just tell sometimes when it's gonna be straight up sweaty good pass was scorable i think he did have it blocked to be honest i don't know if he would have saved it it looked like it though it's good from us try to control us to the right side close on the shot there was a a little bit opening to the right there i was good to find that because i could have actually been a goal how'd i play that a little bit better my first touch here i'm last night for a little bit i could just pinch that up be huge they have to all back off almost got the kill on him good bump that's tough i gotta go quick hey just a good ones player you don't want to give him too much time in those situations you wanna try to stop at the at the source right when it's starting let him go for that i should have went quicker i would have beat him if i just went quick off the wall kind of just took a second to think and in rock league there is no time to think so just turn off your brain and just use your instincts that's the that's the best advice i can give you guys play purely on instinct in those situations you don't have time to second guess that what you're doing is the right decision oh my god that is unfortunate it could be bad are we good pass to my teammate pass back pass it back again maybe a shot oh that'd been a crazy play for solo queue it's fine if you touch that honestly two of them up for this as well should be okay a little bit close but should be fine wait for the 50 there good read good trying to follow up a little bit of a chain reaction of like mistakes there that all stem from one missed only how threes goes these days feels that way at least i should have shot that better just shot right at him honestly one of those situations where you think like shooting at the person would be harder for them because they might pre-jump you have so much time on a shot i'm trying to shoot like above them but kind of at where he was to mess them up uh i was so focused on that guy in the air thought he was gonna hit it it works so good pressure try to get this left side that's really good for my teammates to pass that mid huge play gonna be up for that every touchdown back wall try to pass mid nice if i can demo aj here be big if not even just going for the bumps not a bad idea and threes the main goal always is to keep the ball on their side like if you if you can keep the ball on their side and get your teammates back safely and like not have a super risky situation that's always the goal like you don't want to put your teammates in a bad situation last back for too long right so make sure everyone gets behind you and make sure you have at least two people behind you before you go for anything risky i think it's like the rule of thumb for threes something that i've always tried to follow like this situation is awkward i wasn't sure if i should help him out let's go straight back i don't think i would have been able to get back either way there if i went back really quick it's hard to know in the moment situation a lot of it is just hindsight right after the fact i think oh it could have been that different it would have actually worked better but i don't know so hard to know in the moment i did pre-jump that should be fine though there's no danger in that at all it's actually better for us good aerial adverse that's really good actually okay good amount of pressure teammates should have probably went but he didn't so i should just go for him now nice follow if this is downright that's huge he actually did perfect pass down right that was a really good pass i'll go for this i'll let go for this kick off like i'm not bad at getting it to go to my teammate kickoff always went for obviously because my pro crew have always been the kickoff taker so i'm pretty pretty experienced with those getting to my teammates at least and once i suck the kick off so i'm good at losing them in threes to my teammates but i'm not good at winning them to get free goals and ones not very good at least i'll get lucky sometimes but it's nothing like what i can do in threes with them could have probably been a goal suddenly off on the play there's gonna be a go against us unfortunate got caught up a little bit too far shouldn't probably have ended up in a goal but it's one of those things where third man got a little bit too ahead of himself pushed up too far and ended up being a easy counter attack but those things are super avoidable and it's not something that you know you should be upset about if you're that person because it happens happens to everyone take the mid boost here i should have just went for it it's not bad though i got an ot here sweaty game to finish off on can we get the dub huge 50s gonna go up to the ceiling oh i messed that up i could have better control there maybe scored that messed up a little bit i'll leave the back boost even i i missed it but i could have went back for it but i decided i want now let's just leave it for a teammate i dribble from aj doesn't accomplish too much because he wastes all his boosts and ended up getting possessed out of it anyway i'm gonna take that just in case because they're probably gonna be on our side in a second so i don't want him to go for our corner boost and take it i'm not gonna go for this one i'm just gonna wait i almost got around two that would have been huge could have potentially ended up in a goal if i got by the second guy there we play good try real quick should i catch him off guard he's gonna go for this the challenge from us are we left side if he wants to use me here good 50. not bad at all it's gonna lead to our teammate nice i'm back here full boost this is a really good position to be because worst case scenario just gets over my teammate i'm going to be in a really good spot to follow it up and get some sort of touch i ended up missing but it's a really good spot to be in most of the time because you can get a really good follow-up hit like you'll probably be the next guy up in the play nine times out of ten in the situation not a bad idea there decent 50 for my teammate good hit i'm gonna wait across they're both super awkward waiting left side here if he wants to use me play it under him there we go all right that was sweaty super sweaty game there but we'll take it well played for my teammates they played really well they're they're passing really well they look for each other a lot it's not something you see a lot in solo q3s so it's a huge win yeah it's really tough opponents in the other team tarok and aj obviously both pro players just in caps not bad by any means either very high or more player so yeah hope you guys enjoyed that have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching this make sure you do get your hands on this decal it's super clean ps5 controller i'm still getting used to it but i do see the good in it it's obviously in that state where i'm not used to it at all i just feel like a little bit awkward in some situations because the controller feels so damn new like the sticks feel super new but they feel super good uh the buttons feels too new to me like it's super hard for me to fat fingering these buttons right now that's the biggest thing for me but i do love the controller i hope you guys can get your hands on it as well have yourself a good night like i said and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love you peace you
