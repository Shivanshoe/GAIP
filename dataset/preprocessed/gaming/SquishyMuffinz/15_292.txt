video love y'all enjoy you notice up guys today I'm gonna be running some games with the gear G from energy should be some good games let's get into it see how it goes alright so first thing you're playing it's Adam and Maui just putting these guys are lost but I wasn't recording so we'll see can we take the dubs when I'm sweating we're going full sweat mode probably not we're probably still dude I'm being realistic I'm 12 ish back you look for him here you go again here so are we forget to come back nice you touch Turkish or sido still in their half here so don't want to go for anything too risky I could have popped over that guy just messed up a little bit big I should be fine nice and try to control that himself good way - really awkward spot to be him but we played it patient enough that we wouldn't get scored on got kill but we'll be back - Boosh yeah gotta save as well surprise is going for this ball to be honest gonna be see a shutter block home at the corner it's fine I can fake this you be out of free ball there's like to be super aggressive it is challenge absolutely everything the other side or just take advantage of that one you can I also get 50 from gay but work there are a lot of opportunities already want to admit it in I forgot to be careful on defense or capable of a lot let forget probably better for him won't be one for a while now just slight miss play from the opponent I gotta finish it off here we go I'll try to get one more just to pop it all the way does it delay them it just stopped something be able to make a play and he gives Gary free ball so kind of a win-win unless he gets this crazy angle nice just popping that up again you can't do much with it they have to kind of hit it back to us that's why it's a good good play to make I think yes if it's my left side here back ok probably thought it was gonna be I'm sorry it's my fault yeah hustle Billy made it back I can't really help no problem it's not just fall for expect me to shoot it I just try to have the backwards I expected one of them you to be able to challenge me there it's hard for him to know what I'm being with that ball obviously I was a big miss I'll try to beat the ball here for two bumps on them and then I'm just sliding all over the place they're trying to beat my flick out so I should even panic really should have just waited on that I'll see what I can get them to to give me in terms of space nice forget not like the minute nowadays I feel like the first guy always tries to bed at the flick so you kind of try to call their bluff and use the space that they're giving you to advantage surely I would have beaten my mom played it too passive there even though I knew what I should have done I didn't think I was lost back he'd go for that that's why I waited so long that's why it's a good play on him as well because I'm not good expecting to do something that's very risky like that it's taboo she's fine she back behind in time stay middle if you wants to use me guess fine I'll wait forget to get behind me and I'll challenge you round that beats pretty soon okay block them as well get to me fellas beat them can't shoot but once I get it over him it's not too bad here actually got to give up a 1 B 1 so I made it much more difficult I thought it would be what my card is spazzing out the players back I'll double tonight corner might be fast enough not sure trying to take the boost I'll be back the middle with good amount of boost out but if the ball goes up high here just get a flip I'm stalling figured at this point I know you died I'm trying to make it as rude as possible for them I can go back get this full boost as well maybe yeah 40 seconds got to play smarter this point doesn't go for a lot of balls like super aggressively like that try to catch you off guard can't work or share especially and something like to be - it's pretty good to try to throw your opponent off on for the blind bump and I got it his shot as well but yeah I didn't have my book him on my new TV back there I just went in the path lab all day I jumped where he'd have to go to block that surprised I worked as well as did cuz again I couldn't see him put the best really over both I bumped the other guy gonna delay I'm so you can't shoot right away at least but it's probably still be a goal might have shaved off two seconds though right I did too I have a wide wide open net and just go for the top right clanging it for the placement placement practice nice all right so we got the dub most likely gonna put them again I think there's a highest and the warfighters all right now they're both CK mmm are pretty sure so it's answer next match all right for lesson you're playing against Spock see and Adam so again playing so Adam dude I just got my team actually I ran into get with him on my team and we almost won the game he's not bad definitely don't underestimate him that's why I'm actually carry my gear and now just ran into each other against each other just shot bang well done well done probably play like two more videos again so four more games to them after this I'm just split it up as it is a good content I feel really high level games there's a lot to take from from all these games all these matches tried to pass that off to them getting quite feel like Tuesday's days more down to being patient with your control on the ball and like using the time that you have wisely because again everyone's trying to get in each other's heads with the challenge game and stuff like that I'll just try like just fake that but Garrett kind of like faked my fake I'm gonna just stay in front of that ball so you can do anything like I was pertaining to go for the quick aerial and then just dribble it after Big Ear took it away from me I got the goal himself say you take it too long just one for it we go all the way back here should be give or take me to boost like I think I'm no Beast nice you think it's just the paw paw as a massive fake from Garrett the ball even moves on the replay what they're trying to keep it in here look I'd do anything too crazy that I just don't don't want them to be able to shoot I know gears kind of stuck up field oh you missed really didn't expect to miss their focus too hard on the oh my god what am I reading I thought those gonna go out focused on the opponent such there but never came through I'll imagine suddenly don't forget go back and get some quick sorry wait for you to come back anyway a little confusing let him go for it you're wasting his boost you missed anyway save locations everyone so good defense now crazy I should go to get this time to challenge properly be fine really no angle nice shot Garrett's on a wall there you could say pretty much anything it comes at him I think the lower shots are actually harder to save their just because we're gonna get an awkward touch at a bit like it'll still be a save but it's gonna be really awkward and probably follow cool after trying to make it awkward for him ago for the boat what this guy's just bump and get and just kinda bait him out here I'll just stay right in front of them in the dream like that only make some force up the ball for free you have to throw your position on a bad challenge or something huh wasn't my photos well I just took a better angle with that so they'll play here for the bump hit it around them that guy thought you're gonna be a lot closer so you kind of panicked any better for us to be in I'm gonna block them over and over again it's not a plate over them much as possible um singer quick nice simple you just popped it up carried it off the sidewall it's really awkward spots try to put it the ball there in the corner but we got to go out of it let me go back to the corner nice maybe shot Oh actually but he'd have that I'm so done doesn't miss much that dude so I just assumed you wouldn't miss that as well just kind of give it up I feel this key oh my god shot good I'm so sorry so sorry I'm so sorry I didn't think he'd be so close for some reason and then like by the time I saw him it's too late I think that guy might have beaten Garrett if I didn't touch that but either way I should really be hitting that wall pop it over should be fine for a sake that's control maybe a goal so I played around them really awkward to shoot but try to play the fire first shot across me your patient just like me like a super solid in the backward plays it's smart in most situations I'm trying to bait the ball for you to be there it's fine in the ball dusters tree really panicking a little bit seemed watching these sessions I don't want to give for this like I still gonna be there maybe I can shoot double nice good job you quit turn there you finish as well well done one should be the game up there we go you got the forfeit so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the game for today have yourself a wonderful day or never the time it is when you guys
