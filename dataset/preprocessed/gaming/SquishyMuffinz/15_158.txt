yo what's up guys gonna be playing some threes fours today with justin from my team and shock from sonic should be some good games let's get into it let's see if we can get some dubs see how it goes all right but the first gameplay i hit this high make it awkward for him show off the bat if i could land on them there that's just the extra though but i couldn't quite so now it's a 1v1 for a while mess it up by dropping it too low cover with net someone covered back wall so we're good for the left side here try to wait for this touch here on the wall probably going to also play toward the wall keeping it in his a main goal there i could dribble me here kind of like delay rotation a little bit gotta mess him up a little bit whatever way i can gonna be late to where he would have normally been now let him touch that for me that's fine can't get a shot out of it let us play it across make them panic a bit but i go for this maybe one more time shock i don't have any boost here though but i can at least pressure this play it middle off the 50. i'm gonna go for the boost it looks like so i'll let him have it let's sit around at the mid boost could be fine i played to my back corner over to both my teammates did not fall into that there like i thought it was played to the right side now sorry i'm adjusting there trusting justin quite a bit to win that challenge but more often or not you can trust it because it is justin anybody else you know maybe not maybe they get beat to that ball but you could rely on him to win that nine out of 10 times i'd say i'm letting go for a pinch with them hit off the wall now play right side dude i'm blocking that but again it's not a big deal i play this mid now close good try get attempts then it'll be low boost in a spot where they kind of have to work pretty hard to get out of their zone so not a loss for us i'd say i'm still come out with the possession he's going just in case you misread it but probably wasn't gonna misread it often you just gotta take a risk sometimes especially when it's not that risky too that's never gonna be an immediate goal going for that ball i don't really mind at least trying i know somebody's behind me right if you're a third man there i would say you almost never want to do it i just did but play it to the corner myself play it off the wall now make awk for them play it over justin passing back the big pass back i'm not going for this maybe a pop you try you could save from them good play from us like form a chance today play over to the open space shock should have this now big beat from us players to the right side another good beat from us they'll be like dwindling their boots as long as you don't get beat on this ball too hard it'd be okay we're fine for a little bit here looks a little bit sketchy but honestly not a terrible spot to be in as long as we can use each other to get out go for a bump or two here kind of disrupt their goal line a bit fine not a big deal losing that challenge that hard wait for justin to go again here good dunk white midfield on low boost go for a challenge it's fine kind of forcing them into like panicky positions i don't mind a lot of these situations go right wall now create a play going forward shut up last middle maybe i could bump them here they bumped each other it's not a bad situation for us either they bump each other there i'll slow down two of them instead of just one just painting a touch here play down field open space as well so justin has a little bit of time to work with i'm gonna bait it again i can do something killed one as well which is pretty big there there we go able to capitalize on it 13 seconds left might be the dub might be just enough the game was sketchy by no means was it set in stone game that we're gonna win but we caught the dub that's what matters he said that because i stole his goal at the end i will take it i will take it like if if i get a get a little bit of revenge all the time being stolen my goals i'll definitely take it let's get into the next game steven keep it up see how it goes all right for the last game we got ourselves.mile and snot all right not too bad you only took 30 minutes to find similar players that we've been playing i don't get it sometimes but that's how it goes for the bump they're gonna get some pads doesn't should have this it looks like let them control that taking the boost from them try to shoot at top bins looks like i got it good shot from us replacement good start to the game a lot quicker scored in last game that's for sure like the whole five minutes to score last time definitely prefer a game like this instead we have the lead off the bat watch that again try to pass to justin not the best pass but it was a good idea at least and he was able to follow it up that's the main goal there the most important part i'd say as long as you put the ball into a spot in threes where your teammates can follow it up that's all they can really ask of you like that was not a bad attempt though i'd say i was trying to pass him on the wall but i just hit a little bit too hard get some pads here try to stay relevant if he does win a challenge i kind of catch them off guard keep it in to my teammates are up for this i got to be extra careful here i can't stay for too long nice from justin try to back out as soon as i'm up for that good demo from them shock should have pretty easily on the back wall though don't really give people too much trouble maybe a double can't shoot off this i know that so i might as well just wait make the panic instead i'll just block any shot he would have on goal all i need to do there i don't need to do anything too crazy don't need to stretch too much for that so back wall here justin should have that looks like oh my god he did not have okay i kind of got fake a little bit i couldn't really tell it's a good shot from them though i should have just taken it on the back wall i think i would have been able to definitely clear it i just didn't want to mess up justin or potentially hit her into justin any own goals which would have been unlucky but there's also another possibility that could have happened so the things you have to kind of be careful of should have this play back to the corner for myself try to play it around one but he read it i'll play to him play into the corner try to keep the tin off the wall make it really awkward for them good challenge from justin that's enough to at least force him to the corner i'd say he definitely did his job there prefer to go for this try to pass it forward to him good demo from them shocked it happened to me not terrible i mean the way i went for the 50 there i'm never going to win it middle but it's not about that it's more about not losing it like into our net somehow losing it in a way where it's going to go back to my team which is pretty much what we did i would say we didn't do bad there don't think that was that bad of an outcome that's quite unlucky i'm not sure how that went in to be honest justin somehow own gold i believe it bounced in more i think the ball had some spin on it or something quite unlucky for sure good kill on one though you can get a quick goal back here potentially if you get to beat here got bumps maybe a shot actually really good pass back down if i start adjusting it again couldn't get a good shot but it might be enough as long as i don't get musty we're chilling trying to get out of justin's way then i have one more i'll just go back hole kind of covers all the options if you just wait backwards situation like that because you know someone's gonna be gone behind you most of the time at least in proper rotation someone is gonna be down behind you so if it does get past you you know you block out the initial flip reset and you have someone just clean it up pretty easily get some pads here just gonna have a lot of time to make a play on this but i was trying to pass a shock but it looks like wait for the boom back fun justin's gonna control it not a bad play for him at all can't get in the way of that one but it should be free ball for shock hope there's one more touch here maybe even another one can't go for this gonna have a double just go back it's kind of my my time to go back as soon as you might have a double tap there not bad 50s from us i'm gonna pop this it's gonna be enough time kill to follow it up gotta get clear not doing too bad though two two again one of their goals was pretty unlucky i'd say maybe too upset at this game so far one guy back now we ended up turning this into a 3v one shotgun played out right might be a goal and there we go good pass middle from shock there and i'm third man but i have confidence that i know i can shoot that wall i gotta go out of it so it's not a bad idea to go for something like that if you are confident that you can get a go out of it and we did that three seconds now just gotta not give up the lead to a mistake and i kind of just made a mistake but it's okay we'll take it and they're just faking for some reason which i did not expect but it doesn't work out so gonna be off listen guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
