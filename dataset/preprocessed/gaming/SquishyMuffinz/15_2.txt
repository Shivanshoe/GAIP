yo what's up guys we'll be playing some threes today with seven and gimmick should we see a game let's get into it see some dubs see how it goes all right the first time we got ourselves kryptide bleath and modifying see this goes i'm using different camera settings by a little bit if you guys can probably notice more stiff a little bit closer just trying out different things here experimenting before worlds it's a good little play nice first touch around one it makes it hard on the last guy let's get right to make have one touch here that's fine nice and uh safe touch across night there there obviously something that wasn't dangerous or risky at all love doing those i wanted to like pass it back into a corner or hit it across for gimmick but i ended up realizing it probably wasn't the best idea as soon as i did it but didn't end up too terribly to be honest compared to what it could have been it could have just been a straight-up angle wasn't awful we still kept possession that was my main intention that won't be great just trying to read mine well usually i would say you usually win that engagement like you may touch like that and they try to read you quick their touch after the fact won't be that perfect so it's gonna usually benefit you i'd say someone tries to quickly read you like that gimmick i played around one here i'm not going for a shot there's more just to keep it in play for the miss there it's not a bad play to make i could leave now let gimmick have that boost though let's take the further back one play around he doesn't have a free touch but it's okay it should be easy for gimmick soft touch to myself i'm gonna fake a few times here that i'm hitting it into me i hit this away i can go for a bump as well creates a good amount of pressure when we do that driving through it for a bump there it's good enough challenge again just baiting that touch not going to be the greatest because i just drove up showed presents nice bit behind gimmick here i played around one softly took a quick shot good read from gaming i have no boost here just got that full boost which helps a lot soft touch around one about a 50 middle take the mid boost let's stay on this left side here that's pretty much all the space i'm supposed to be covering too much should have a big hit nice oh almost on gold but it's actually really good situation still for us we have so much pressure two of them are low boost here so they might be playing for like panicking touches so we have the advantage still by a lot here play one over his head it's gonna be a bad touch because of that he has to follow it up with the flick to my team gives us the ball still here's one big hit it's good i'm just waiting here try to clean this up now they can't get a good shot on this i can just bait it it doesn't really matter where it goes just debate it over my myself to my team hopefully try to keep it close go for a bump here actually really good two bumps would be even better off the corner for gimmick it's fine save my boost now if my teammate can win this ball it's huge it's just any kind of touch where he could possession next it's actually really good bumped him off but he can't double he's gonna make a free 1v1 usually very good in situations should be just a goal that's it oh blade but off the wall myself oh i missed that's fine it's off to myself let him hit this off the wall do anything too much and i can just 150 after that's fake wait for the mid pass if he wants to use me i'll be here i'm just going to pre-jump now there's a chance she'll have a big touch to me it's fine the back wall to be hard for them to get a good shot if anything on it i have the high cover team it has a low not much they can really do there it's a good demo i think that was worth it because it looked like he messed up honestly he didn't get the touch he wanted probably but i should play a little bit more safer took my time here over one she's good and i still have 30 boost take two pads and i'm working with a good 50 here which is more than all you need to challenge something it should be a goal as well close there's no way first click here and if not we just win so good first game against the next let's even keep it up get back to back dubs see how it goes well played from my squadron all right we got ourselves prussia immortal and golf i get this left side change my camera settings as you can tell back to what i've been using in my free time should be over nothing to worry about still full boost as well good touch i'm just going to go for this if i can beat him it's actually really good it should just be a goal off the back again oh my bad my gimmicks actual menace he bumped both of them nice flick take a quick shot why not give mix touch another good shot i'm gonna play it left should be a goal good demo smart them on the way back like you just did makes it really hard to keep pressure for like a long period of time if you're just looking for a demo like that should be a shot try off the back wall again for gimmick i make it as hard as possible for the opponent like all these touches i'm just trying to make sure they're out of reach for them and they can't get a very easy uh follow-up touch on them try to help out my teammate there because he seemed a little bit flat-footed it's gonna wait it's never really gonna be a goal it's no kind of angle on the ball click i write for gimmick good demo play across oh seven's locked but if the universal open duo here may give me the way i lose two's games very often i have a lot of uh a lot of faith in us here whatever one good bump from gimmick nice just waiting for the perfect moment to uh let it go off my car there as soon as i saw he was looking to challenge i dropped it off my car for a low 50 instead i think it's the right player to make there a challenge for gimmick here to cover as many options as possible when you're challenging an irritable don't challenge just one thing don't go as fast as possible to it make yourself as valuable to your team as as you can when challenging something like that that's the number one tip i i can give you guys but it's a gimmick yes he's gonna be ready for any kind of shot on that there so i think the pass across smarter play to make for sure aqua calls me akko is one of the upcoming prodigies of renee a little youngster he's really good though he loves to call me the flying squirrel because thinks the way i play reminds him of flying squirrel i'm just crumbling through there every time i used to play with him before he was a pro i used to say that i would go for some weird unusual play i need to call me a flying squirrel wait for his next touch i'm gonna fake this keep it close over 50. much more than throwing that away i think there he's possession in our hands and we can make a lot more out of it i message makeup i didn't realize you can go that quickly i was just trying to play it over them well done we still just linked up so well i feel like i always know where he wants to be those situations he always reads me very well very rare um you know you can have chemistry like that with a player the highest level is actually very very difficult game was really fast being able to read something like that is actually very valuable that's why it's so weird like playing against gimmick i feel like he knows what i want to do so well vice versa i'm gonna fake this you may have a free touch now when the beta touches that i can go back not really of you staying up there make some pads get a quick challenge there we go that was right situation challenge faster can be flat-footed he's like low boost just paying attention to me he's gonna also assume i'm not gonna go because i'm third man so he's assuming that if i go i'm gonna get beat bad for my team he probably just going to play a little bit safer but that situation you want to catch your opponent off guard take a challenge you might not expect plus try to give him an option to his right good fakes take my time on this see if i can figure if i could fake them there and sell full control that would have been a really dangerous situation for them to do it i still pass back from gimmick i can't actually beat into this but i can at least force them wide which is just as good i'd say nice challenges jeez i'm trying to like hit it back while pretty much maybe getting it back into me but i should've come for a double but i'm probably just gonna go well play one more game let's get into this even get some dubs let's see how it goes after last game we got prussia immortal and god alrighty like the same people are always doing the party now in threes it's the bounce down unlucky bounce to be honest giving shoot back for it still full boost find gonna go for a 50 fine guys then we're gonna score off that i have two people behind me worst case scenario if it gets over me it's like is my team the ball so i don't really mind that situation this might be bad seven a little flat footed yeah the shots not the greatest but not much i can do i should have went for him there i didn't realize he couldn't go but i think he might have had no boost he might land it with zero but it's our back corner you give me some time on the ball this pressure here i don't have to like [ __ ] me on this more just to stay close make him have to flip into me demo is just a added bonus now this guy going full speed kind of just hurts their team when anything huge challenge when hard for giving to shoot it we actually got the goal i don't know how i actually want to see i don't know how i won that to be honest but the own goal oh whoa tried to backflip over his net i think like playing with the baller's net but it's time to buy a bit this is a difficult thing to get perfect to be honest i'm trying to wait here he sells control very very uh unfortunate didn't really react to it i'm gonna let him hit this i'm gonna mess his teammate up wow that was the last thing i thought someone would do that's probably a goal for us he didn't do that it looks so bad like it looks like it probably shouldn't do it from his perspective i bet but actually the only way they're not getting scored on there them doing that because you're like double committing with whoever's about to challenge that pretty much it's definitely not like the you know situation you want to be in but it's not a bad thing to do to go for a bump like that it's because i love the demo it looks like this goes back to our teammate good thing about playing a deep third one going for like a passport like that usually doesn't work out terribly i try to play off the wall here makes a lot harder on them and i can still win the next boost challenge which is actually the most important thing there they're not playing for an immediate goal we're playing for pressure here we gotta go off of it play to get good touches middle to each other and not just necessarily straight up a goal there i'm gonna pop this for my teammate should be behind me nice let's stand play here give me cuz of 50 let me go for the boost put under one challenge that go for one more here oh what would have been probably a goal i got the skin touch i wanted was a difficult touch to make but it was worth it for the outcome if it worked does the bump do a good job with that filled one just good probably can't bump this guy back a try don't any boost how to play it around them go for the mid boost now just stay on they can't shoot this and fake the bounce get off the back oh it should be cool try i could pass right maybe as i see that he can i'm just trying to back off early it's a good demo they pretty much have no attack now after that demo it's really good off the wall for gimmick nice a shot isn't a good idea for me there i can go for a shot but there's a guy waiting back well i'll just plant it any kind of shots to be saved very easily by him so i think the best players played around him i'm gonna wait for a shot here again i know his boost is low like i was a cheater probably a 30 50 boost maybe if you played it perfectly let off the back wall again for gimmick a lot of my touches most time aiming to hit it around people the best way to play out threes i think it's a lot more opportunity when you're trying to hit around people trying to create space by making touches that the opponent can't reach and even if you get beat here a gaming shop isn't incredibly hard there's a lot of time to react to what's going to happen because he's playing deeper played over one i'm gonna grab the mid boost but it's not a big deal i can go all the way back for this and now i'm the deep third i'm the person that if it gets past my team i'll be here to recover the situation and they can't really score off this has to be absolute perfect hit on a pre-flip to score that so there's really no no danger playing like a deep third and then like too aggressive on attack and also lets you go for more of those uh like demo he plays play off ceiling plus good job though it again say hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night what's happening because you're watching this like comment subscribe to see us on the next one i love y'all um
