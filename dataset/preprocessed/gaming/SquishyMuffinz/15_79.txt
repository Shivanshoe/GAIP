yo what's up guys but today's video gonna be solo queueing threes twos and one be one so whatever we get we'll play let's get into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how again all right for the first game we got ourselves a 1v1 game we got guacamole gonna be uh interesting one i don't know who this is but we found this game instantly they're going to be good unfortunate bumped him into that able to help him recover off of it good delay on the save there good bump from him don't know if it's fast enough he's probably gonna have it to get a touch from him there better stay on this fake the flip keep possession here as long as you don't flip into that stuff and like you don't will commit you're always going to have a pretty good advantage in these situations like right there that's pretty smart of him not to flip into i don't have to do anything again i still have control there we go wait for him to actually full commit give us the opening give us the chance to get a flick over him played it really well though the first minute i focus on our kickoff though but stuff like that doesn't happen because we could definitely lose games just off kickoff and once in my opinion 1v1 is still 100 decided by the kickoff so if you guys want to get good at ones i recommend learning how to do a good kickoff and learning how to counter certain kickoffs i still don't know how to honestly i kind of just try to like brute force my way through the kickoffs and then just try to outplay them during the actual game um not a bad way to play but like you want to be consistent and be like a really good ones player these days you definitely have to learn all the different kill off strats and stuff took my time here one touch now let's take a shot here see what he does i'm gonna have to save it off his backbone i'm gonna have possession of this i tried to fake the the late jump there clicking save stuck in my net as well which is good for me take this boost it should be a goal yeah actually get back to that schema is also so reliant on just like little mistakes right so the more like you can get your opponent to just over commit why you spending so hard that was open oh i like i like the trash talk he wants it he wants to dub but yeah any little mistake you can get your opponent to to make early on it's going to be good for you like committing for little things like right there i was good at him he made me like kind of like push the ball into him he won the 50 wall and then i'm in an awkward spot after that right this kickoff that he's doing he's really overpowered as well almost nothing you can do about that kickoff if they do it right because they're going to have possession every single every single time it's a good shot we can keep control of this it's going to be a go on a second just fake the the flip take our time that's really okay to do that most of the time if you go up the ceiling and you have your flip you could threaten it the whole way through and most of the time it's gonna be good gotta wait for this flip there i don't have any boost it's kind of risky to go for the full commit there but we're still bumping him off the ball which is good can't actually get back there it's a good try [Music] let's see he says surely he's typing there he also my boost is pretty good for us try not to commit so much because all the goals he's gotten so far have been off us like pretty hard committing here so the rest of this came out a little bit safer it's fine let him shoot this [Music] see he does he saves it aside i can get another shot and go maybe let him panic there we go it's crazy how little you really have to do in this mode though to get goals it's so much about just not jumping like not diving for stuff because if i just know for that i would have got fake this is a good player too is a good ones player for sure i don't know about twos or threes i don't know who this is but you could tell they're good just by the kickoff right you guys only have to work for two of his goals because they got some off kick off so that's something that you know right off the bat they're in experience once player if they can get those goals off of literally just understanding how to use their kickoff to their advantage and there's me just forcing my way for these goals got a fake challenge on kickoff he reads it takes to the side and i just drive into it get the bump take advantage of the situation wait this is good content i like this a lot it's not every day run into someone that's like toxic because normally if they see they're playing me they tend not to say anything but this guy's a different breed i like the situation though i'm not going to say anything to provoke them i want him to just i think in this situation just let him have like a conversation with himself and then by the end of the game he's going to look at his comments and be like wow i look pretty dumb i was unlucky that i didn't get that there it's a good demo guacamole is on the case try to fake challenge close the space early wow almost really unfortunate one of those touches that happened like you mess up your initial flick and then like the end of your flip just hits the ball where you wanted it to originally should have just sat on the floor there there was a little boost in a bad spot might be fast enough not sure nice all right we got one kickoff gold back we'll take it like your obvious thing is so good though i learned that um for the that perfect that pinch off the ground see what he does here oh he actually just shoots it okay so i could have just know i thought i was gonna do if i dove at that i would have completely dunked him into his half would have been probably a goal for me got to be careful here now though his possession off kickoff here he does go ceiling here should be fine for me i got the boost let's keep it up no i wanted the double on bigger for the last second vm that's what he says hold on let's let's see if he can dig himself a deeper hole than he already has he's only talked to himself the whole game i keep for 20 minutes just tell these who is this actually i'm so curious who this is it's a good one player for sure i don't know who this is though guacamole x i don't i just i don't know who it is all right anyway doesn't matter he had a fun time talking to himself um yeah i hope you enjoyed the first game against the next one see if it's ones twos or threes let's see how it goes all right for last time we got ourselves 12 who's on a batmobile oh my against bra and kx or kayaks and i try to say that but see how it goes picking the first the first touch here stay behind him i haven't seen a batmobile in rank so long it's so weird looking they messed up really bad so i should have a lot of time here wait for the bounce here i played around him like the next high touch fit under him played over to him now i should have just went solo honestly i probably could have scored it i tried to pass but the habit of mine from from threes i was trying to pass stuff like that really good touch the first boomer here it's fine there's more toward me i would have had it but i was just trying to float cover some options anybody's too much boost either should be fine we have some time here not a bad situation hopefully my teammate can just challenge if he gets beat that's underway that gets bad but if he just goes any kind of touch on the ball is good doesn't really matter same thing here kind of just how rotation's working right now we're kind of just trying to get touches on these challenges nothing crazy but as long as we just keep challenging when we have to it's not going to be anything dangerous for a bit like that i don't have to go for that i kind of just made him make a bad touch on his own ah so close should have been a goal i just missed time my flip just by a little bit good try though i haven't beaten that i didn't waste much boost only use 20 to get to that ball the challenge off the wall for ourselves we go for a shot it's a good play there we know we can't go quick to that my team is still not rotated back so we don't want her to take that off the corner no one can follow it up so soft touch to herself there is definitely the best play good job sit behind him here wait for the flick he messed up his flip actually help them one of the situations where like the mistake actually works better than the actual thing double but i can at least make them all panic which is good run that a boost for the double nice it's a good read nice fast read there good pass from my teammate i don't think he meant to pass it obviously but one of those things that you just kind of take you go with it you're in the position so you just try to take a shot try to snipe it close pop it up i'm not trying to go for a shot off that because i know they're going to be there for it and it's better it kills more time for my team to get a actual challenge on this next ball it's a good 50s my teammate isn't getting beat it's fine nice win really good win actually and he kills me so it puts me all the way back to rotation pretty much completes the whole rotation from me without having to do anything which is why i like that so i would have probably just beat him there went all the way back anyway hit it high wait for him he has to get it some some type of control touch on this and just bait his touch here teammates should go now now it's awkward gets past them but okay again just go for me and i'll be ground one covering high i'm covering ground and it should be okay go for a bump on this guy and i should have nice gotta play it over him with the soft touch i didn't think you could go for the boost so kind of your rotation off a little bit but okay that's 50 off the wall i can't follow that but it's okay i have left side of the field now any kind of touch that comes here i'll be here for it that's something that you have to like keep track of as well like if your teammate is on the right side don't bunch up all the way on the right with him as well unless you know 100 that there's no way i can go left right i'm gonna have the most field coverage as possible that way you're not like completely caught off guard when the ball goes flying somewhere i'm ready for this one let's hit it off the wall don't mind if you get to touch on this pretty easy to save you took the boost again but as long as he controls it should be fine nice and then we have 30 seconds to make a play now so it's going to be really rushed the rest of the play is going to be really rushed i know that so i can start throwing in some fakes stuff like that doing some more fix then i actually have to like full commit for any of these balls and one big fake here everybody first throw the ball away right so don't make it easy for them you can save press my teammate here good job my first touch nice good job all right good game today hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
