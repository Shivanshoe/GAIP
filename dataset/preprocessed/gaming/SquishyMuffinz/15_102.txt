yo what is up guys gonna be solo queueing some 2v2 games for today as you could tell the season ends in two days says right over here so what we're gonna do next season is go for top five in every single leaderboard uh on top of that i also want to do a road to supersonic legend starting next season at some point i don't know exactly when but i definitely want to start doing that um early on in the season next season but i'm going to talk to psionics about it and make sure i can do that because there's some rules against doing the road supersonic legend i'm not sure 100 how it works but i want to talk to make sure i have to go ahead to do that um but outside of that starting next season in two days i definitely want to go for top five in the leaderboard but let's play some two games for today let's chill late night right now let's play some games have some fun let's get into it see how it goes all right we got miho against volt and expert for the first game very sweaty match put the ball over to me right away which is really good good air dribble i gotta be careful because i am last back here and i might get demos so as soon as i got back off that's my go to the challenge i know me who's behind me as well there those are the two things you want to look for one challenging something like that obviously i'm taking a little bit of risk challenge like that i'm playing 1v1 i'm not going to challenge like that not the best way to challenge but if i know someone's behind me there's no reason not to go that ball's just going to go over to my teammate most likely let's take a shot see what happens there's decent pressure on them as well i didn't realize mijo would be that close to be honest that's my mistake i should have looked take my time on this should bounce up the wall try to keep the ball close here played over one if we can again every touch that i make when i'm making a play down field like that i'm trying to make it as awkward as possible on that phone and i don't want them to have an easy time dealing with anything right it's right here again look how much space i've given myself to work with play it off the back wall now and let me have a free shot so giving yourself all that time like that and making yourself threatening it might look like the the defenders were trolling there or like they made a big mistake but they really didn't because they had to respect the fact that i had my flip there i just played it well and i use the threatening part of that play to my advantage i knew that it would work because they obviously have to accept the fact that i could just flip that around them and they have to be ready for that so that's why they waited backfall got my flip i never actually used it i just waited on the floor made them give me the space trying to keep it in i'm trying to go for a go off that 50. that's a very important thing there very very important detail going for the gold shaft that 50 is not a good idea in a situation most of the time it's gonna lead you to get um destroyed on that challenge i would say majority of the time if you do that number one i almost got over a second guy might just get a bumper be annoying here it's really good i go for a second bump now made him jump which is more than enough maybe the other guy jumped which is really good as well there we go empty net really good situation to go for a bump there be a little bit of a nuisance make it hard for them to feel comfortable i don't really like that mijo goes for that boost there but it's fine might still be fine here should still be fine again threaten the fact that i have control of this bounce they're really in fake nice to them good finish they might leave earlier they did all right well played well played first game let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up might play two more depending on how quick the next one is but we'll see i don't really like doing two games if one of them is uh really short like that so let's play two more most likely let's get into the next one let's see how it goes all right we got top cheese versus cat and elevated buffy see we got here i'm gonna fake this gotta take our space here that's fine don't mind that bit of them both in pretty good with that so pretty much what the whole point of that is is to make the moisture boost all the resources get their last man back in like an uncomfortable position and if we did that we're all there like a shot all right i was well played or played we'll play that's gonna do if you're in your corner and uh you have the boost you have the full ball control there that's the best time absolute best time to try to bait them in especially something like twos you have to throw it away right away everyone has that um automatic i think like reaction when they get the ball that they should flick it over someone they should try to like throw it away right away you don't have to i don't think that's the the best way to play all the time again of uh impossible situation there i actually don't know how we did that should have for sure been a goal and we got around the whole team and gotta go out of it so we will take it save all my boost on the cheat here i'm gonna go for a fast shot here there we go took my time kept up well got a really good shot on that very hard for the guy in net to get that he wants me to fake i think yeah i can't pass off of it so smart to go to the corner that's fine i should have space here i want to check first ah so close maybe a shot nicely done hold on well done it's a good play though i saw the guy up so i had to speed up the ball a little bit in the air get it over that guy if i didn't he would have had the challenge so something that oh my gosh that's almost crazy can you save it you can good job i'm gonna fake jump here and make a panic another fake jump kind of played around them watch the bump gotta pass back to him i'm gonna fix up here balls will be in there they're gonna think that i'm up most likely so hopefully i can get back to this now that would have been actually massive brain i would have been able to recover quicker because i didn't actually jump for it if i jumped i was beat regardless so the only way that i really get back to that is if i did what i did there he's even turning around and boosting back like immediately i don't think i would have got back in time almost massive brain almost pop it over the back wall i know my teammate in the corner as well so as long as i save that in any way it's gonna be okay for us all right you had to dodge that one bump that was kind of awkward we got out there wait for the 50. it might come right side so i'm just gonna stay here i played over one for another slow touch post this one i'll play back it's only a safe spot to play the ball into and actually comes here and takes the boost and takes the ball so hopefully i can bump him i'm gonna try to take all the boost on the right side here there's a little bit of risk in doing that but there's no risk if they just get the ball slammed at them and they own goal i guess so i was gonna say there's a little bit of risk in doing that obviously because my teammate does have the ball there so i know that there's safety in it and there's risk because if the guy challenges that you know has met the challenge on their team and he just destroys my teammate on that 50 50. it's gonna be a goal for sure right it pretty much makes it a 1v1 me taking that guy's boost makes him pretty much useless in the play and also makes me useless in the play because i'm going all the way to the side for the boost so pretty much makes it a 1v1 and i really have to trust my team to to win that challenge and i am trusting him there he did a good job i got us a little bit so good second game another short one so let's play one more should i end it off on another one see how it goes all right for last time we got thunder against the dapper and spooder interesting and then a dub here hopefully trying to get one more time here after i made him pop it almost got the touch around him it should have been huge he might even got bumps actually could be really bad for us i can't tell what's happening nice really good save let's keep control here i messed up my touch shots in the vehicle that's a big mistake for me it's not what i wanted so it happened sometimes you got to try to get those control touches i kind of over over thought my my play a bit there i wanted to kind of trap the ball to myself land on the ground and stay with it right but instead my car kind of like recoiled off the ball which happened sometimes when you try those touches it's kind of the the downside to it fun force them high should be easy for my teammate now and i say though my boost is really good that's very unfortunate i had a little bit too much faith in him beating him there which i shouldn't let's try have cover both options it's good to have faith in them i think sometimes but also good to cover both options there instead of just you know kind of hoping only one thing happens hit rock back wall it's fine good challenge from thunder oh sorry go back here right to my corner it's only safe space right now it's fine it's a good fake unlucky that he followed it up he's kind of just reaching hoping he can get some sort of touch on it to mess me up he did a good job at that it's a really good shot there good job from us i'd say both the goals have been mistakes of mine so we could definitely clean up this game a little bit a lot of time to play better a lot of time to make up for the mistakes that we made earlier no one's perfectly at the end of the day ah it's unlucky that is actually unlucky it goes off the wall perfectly perfectly for him right back and there's no way you could control where that goes in that situation you're just kind of hoping that the ball dies or at least stays with them in a favorable spot and just went perfectly right back to him close let's keep us in here still a good situation i'd say that was gonna be zero boost on the walls you can't do anything with this really you should go for this nice now you get a 1v1 there we go only way we can turn that into a goal we're doing good on offense this game making mistakes on defense but that's okay close out the dub it's 4 a.m right now big 4 am ranked dubs i'm about to close them out leave i'm going to challenge my teammate let me just drive into it it doesn't have to be anything crazy doesn't have to be perfect again just drive into it it's fun can't do much but just try to hit it to the side in a spot that they can't get a good shot out of it he makes back balls i'll try to discover ground here good job wait for the bang he's gonna have one more touch here most likely so i didn't really want to commit on that knowing that he probably had one more i put some good pressure on them here play it off to my teammate i'd be careful though it could actually be bad for me yeah very very tough so the thing that actually made the awkward in my is the fact that my teammates they're like trying to bump what was missing the bump so i have to wait i kind of have to i have no choice but to wait because he's doing that so if he doesn't get the bumps it's actually like really tough for me because i can't really believe it's going to happen it's kind of like when someone's going full speed at a ball and end up just missing and then you have to like you're reading the original touch but now you have to change all that your whole read changes completely because you didn't expect to miss and it came in last second it's a downside of when your teammate's going for a bump like that it's a right idea to help there but if he doesn't get it it makes the situation impossible it's actually impossible to deal with that for that all right minute 24 we got it no biggie no biggie all right empty net should be able to convert this nicely done place the last one back after that as well so even if the shot's not great it's gonna have to do a pretty crazy maneuver to eat around me and also save it let's go quick here i'm gonna get the ball now for free i'm just gonna stay try to go to the side boost here got a passing to go for the bump as well you may couldn't actually go it's unfortunate actually would have been a really good opportunity let's get a little bit aggressive here we have 40 seconds left so i'll try to make something happen nice good job yeah we just kept aggressively challenging tried to bait them in there screw the spawn on a good side for us to be honest like you couldn't help this team up i just went for a quick touch middle anything fast anything dangerous gonna be good there honestly let's try to go for a shot straight up but if it came through i was gonna take it happily one of those situations it's actually pretty good for two thunder us nicely done all right well we've turned this game around to turn this game around it's been one of those messy 4am 2v2 games the classic see if we can finish it off there random flick which is good you can actually reach this i can just hit it to the side it's a good challenge teammate can't go though unfortunately i challenged her that you couldn't do anything with the ball really my teammate is actually back turned not in a good spot to follow it up so pretty much as long as speed shot that on goal is going to be a cool where my teammate was at all right that's a game right there that's a a real nail biter for you guys one of the most interesting ranked games i've played in a while to be honest a lot of goals a lot of goals in there and a lot of them probably shouldn't have been goals a lot of mistakes but you know what i kind of want to show you this just so you guys can see that even at the highest level there's a lot of mistakes that happen especially in twos two is a very messy payout of game mode with a lot of randomness in my opinion so i'm not the biggest fan of it that's why i love 3v3 i played there's so much more team play in 3v3 so much less chaos so much more structure it's just better in every way in my opinion that's why i love it that's why i don't like twos games like this is a perfect example why i'm not a fan of these but anyway good 4am session hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace [Music] you
