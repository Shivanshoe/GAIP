Yoda some guys gonna be Kingston tooth today with really who's a high grand champ friend of mine he's nine-hour I saw yes for anything he's just a up and coming player pretty much so should be some fun game just showing anyway and yeah hopefully we can get some goals get into it alright first game plenty of trees and precision trees is a once player I believe and precision I haven't really played yes before so we'll see how this one goes not sure what to expect really but we'll take it as it goes try control us in the law over one somehow I scored all right wow I don't know how I really know how I take my time popped it over one which is good that guy should have had eight to the corner cool alright my team would have be able to fall up anyway so it had pressure so I don't know we're probably gonna go for us eventually off of that play but came a lot earlier than I expected good I make him flick on us back off i define fake that that's good first of all to my teammate i can get their boost and getting a good spot again chose one hit up the wall trying to make them hit it so i team it it's fine you get taken now nice should I make it really rude for him hitting it worked spots I know he's low boost here so it's fine force it back to my teammate which is good for us why should I get the bish here good the chin this is fun there's no downside taking any of these 50 is really well normally come out on top of those I feel like the playing off of us over and over again there's a lot of wood to this now you just driving into each other it really is what it is a lot of this driving into each other and trying to make people miss and stuff like that we had 50 guys go for a mid boost it's kind of risky try the kills teammates make it weird I get it back that's good this is um honestly very much how much na two's games you know these days it looks weird it is it is weird that's how the game is progressed to be very weird especially to use everyone's kind of trying to mind game each other on the floor so if you see people just driving around like a bunch of like platinum players it's actually supposed to be a big brain these days that's actually the play you drive up to the ball you just drive back it's all you gonna do over and over again so someone just makes a really big mistake and then you get a free going that's kind of what it is we're devolving not gonna go for this I know to it you're gonna be there quick try to cut it out so they don't point you might should have nice clear is huge actually in Viking Duncan okay there we go I had the dunk computer hi-hat ate it up it's the only way you could have possibly hit that ball I had it locked that's gonna be the first game I was actually really good for you out of that but I'm surprised I left that early yeah very weird game but again that's a lot of how any to go this is a lot of just dribbling the ball trying to force him to make mistakes stuff like that so it's going to the next one stands it some more weird gameplay alright so you gotta really startling here we got Ronan in skills running his prime Thunder he's been an RCS a couple times so solid player and skills are all ours player that we played recently I believe for a different video that's fine kind of warm hey that's my teammate I'm just there to force him to hit about back wall welcome to both panting for and they both did I thought my shot was gonna be better than it was good save he was actually the best spot possible for that shot holy Shah was really good actually by using a good spot for it so I made it bad it'll be better for me to shoot that ball really badly honestly where he was okay I'm not going to eat that again it's me it went so I don't want to do something weird at the bomb should he go quick on this keep it in nice I wish I got that booster than huge nice shot cut them off guard I was really good good of him to be there no dude how am I missing that almost I almost got a scored on my missing - oh no I trust my teammate I believe nevermind that's really hard I shoulda score the double I suck I was a really weird I don't blame her for being if you said hey that's really weird I should score the double tip though I beat that first guy by a mile and then didn't take my time when I had it in there had to rush the plate so much it's like my boots kind of sucks but it happens this happen I'm gonna be basis for a little bit I did some pads here there we go might as well follow that up I'm ready there no reason to back off and play scared in that situation my diesel try to force something cuz if not if you lose that next touch I'm in a really rough spot with low beast I know what teammate is none now this is all me on me pretty much to save this how's your bomb biggest boost it's good though makes him pretty much useless knots I want to be one shudder bumpin oh I don't want it in my tummy was also really close like really close behind me so I left them probably have to retreat and use all this boost they're nice me just jumping there's a single jump forced them to make a bad touch I'll be behind just a little bit awkward actually missed I can get his boost which is good I think yeah you'd be alone now you can't follow it up I bumped the other guy should be double nice there we go so I got the boost on the one guy means he couldn't have got a previous lift touch my teammate can get a free ball just floating middle and I bumped the other guy so you couldn't actually get a challenger I save on the double tap which is really good guy see I'm waiting middle I just got to try to bait a touch over or shoot that works he didn't flip I saw you'd never slip anymore so I'm there to either bait or get a go got a shiner cover as many options as possible and a smell like that cuz even though they're on the back wall is still pretty dangerous if you bet yourself in pretty much anytime anyone else control the ball now it's it's pretty dangerous honestly unless they have zero boost even then they can maybe pull some stuff off with some of the wavedashes these days actually surprised myself I was able to stay with that the mid Boosh hit over one surprised me when I was gonna back off but that was actually much better play for me because I probably scored if he if you went for that then you go for an air dribble bomb that is Boost forcing him to get the other boost and I can get a kill as well should leave the net wide open for us there we go I just chased them up to the other boost and they kind of made him have to make that play like yet I hope your teammate gets to touch if you're him really should be able to get back here a little bit awkward my head to the wall again I'm gonna fake there we go was he a play like a much space I gave myself by faking that ball now he was in an awkward spot my take a touch just jumped over bump got it everyone playing it back I'm confusing them I'm in their heads didn't hit that I just leave it all you need to go for this again it's not really dangerous trying to play as patient as possible and make it as weird as possible for them I actually got that pass over what the heck I don't play often really finish okay I didn't think I was trying to pass to him I didn't think I'd pass it perfectly Chinese my but I was kind of trolling like a minute there but it was working but the kid I'm being as weird as possible got the block just enough what we needed there that should be the game though can't really get three goals as quick all I had to read too close all right good games oh really played really solid something I was playing a little bit stupid and I was messing around a little bit in there yeah -
