before we get into the video guys i just wanted to say a huge thank you for making this dream of mine to reach 1 million subscribers a reality i can't believe i'm actually looking at this number on my screen right now there's a tweet from my twitter from the day and the hour that we reached 1 million subscribers i released my one more montage as well so if you guys did enjoy that every single goal within that montage i think outside of one or two is against rcs level defenses which makes every single goal that much better i didn't want to put just the same old ranked montage clips where you're just clipping on people that don't know how to defend very well and uh i really wanted to make it special so i made it all rlcs clips rlcs pro screen clips and i hope you guys enjoyed that and also came out with merch the link will be down below in the description guys so if you want to celebrate one meal with me get some merch down below it's super comfy super clean yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video i love y'all yo what's up guys gonna be playing some more threes for today with garrett and kenobi should be some good games yet again let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes got a sweaty first game got ourselves jay wismot uh marijuana and mars all right let's see we can do touch from garrett i should be able to shoot this i missed couldn't quite get the angle i'm just gonna fake here let go get a free ball those angles that are too sharp like that you shouldn't go for the shut up shot that was like a mistake i made there should have played that different instead of straight up trying to shoot that a little bit better to do what i did here which is take a touch and then take a shot if you're not 100 sure you can get the shot shot off the bat you should always slow down first but that's the play that uh sometimes you make me or just autopilot it a little bit one of my first touches here yeah him wasting his boost here doesn't really accomplish much to be honest i want my team to get the ball behind me so it's not a bad thing by any means faster crow there we go i had a free touch there on the ball instead of going for a double tap or just a solo play it's better to use your teammate situation like that because the guy going back is going for the boost right yeah the monster explosion is nice i do like it so i'll leave that for crow gonna be mid here just waiting i gotta stay in a position where i can't react if that goes bad though which we ended up doing but unfortunately we got dumped straight into our net but good saves from my team oh yeah i couldn't get back to that i was so like tunnel vision on the guy going off the top of the net i think it was garrett yeah so tunnel visioned on it that i didn't even did you realize that worked really well actually i should have just been parked mid i think there have been better play might be in yeah unfortunate garry's last time back and he got them let's do a flick from jay with jerry's best player on this team i think i'm not sure the other people are but i think from experience that jay was uh gonna be the main player we gotta watch out for in this squad most likely that was a good demo from uh from their side for sure wait for the boom here should be fine for garrett again getting beat to something like that isn't necessarily bad especially when you go straight to your team like that gotta wait for the touch here one more from garrett hopefully good dunk all right try to get i keep getting bumped these weird spots like that just keeps on happening everyone's a bumper now like they're going for a bump on m2 play it over to garrett's side nice he's gonna be there beat one to the ball gonna wait middle now i'm not gonna go for that that's fine whole goal is to keep pressure here don't necessarily need to go for every single ball but pitted in spots that are good to go for right hidden spots your team can just keep on following up over and over again it's the main main play that's fine we're trying to clear danger crow should pass this mid nice should be a double i tried so hard to pass that tried too hard to pass that hit the ceiling for crow should be okay should i kill one i'm gonna chase him he's going back must be coming toward him it's all by the way he's moving there that there was some sort of danger because he went back to goal should be fine actually good for us that that happened nice from garrett right middle here i played around him there we go nice and simple don't do anything crazy there don't need to try to go for the shot use your teammates when you can the main thing there is trying to beat that guy it's the biggest biggest thing in that play trying to go for this one more time maybe missed a second touch but it's okay actually worked out better there we go worked out really well actually if i hit that second touch i think they might have been expecting it so i might have faked them if i did hit the second touch they probably would have had a free dribble so in hindsight it's actually better that i did it but yeah let's get into the second game stephen keep it up i gotta go all right the last gameplay is emc and the two guys from the previous game so let's get some dubs finish it off with another back-to-back win we back wall here this is super hard to stop should be good though there we go good play from garrett to use the option i'm gonna be cheating here what did she tell like to just slow cheat don't waste any of my boost that way whatever does happen i can react to works so well we waiting behind you get us a solo play if you guys don't know what cheating is i'm sure a lot of you guys do know what it is but if you don't know what it is oh we missed wow why did that work better why did that work better than if you actually hit the ball this game makes no sense bro like if you actually hit the ball it would have been blocked so easily to the side but he missed and it actually worked so much better but yeah what the cheating is is pretty much okay off like this someone just follows up slightly behind the key off taker that way you can react whatever happens try to help your team out that's the whole idea of it you try from garrett killed one going back right here i'm a placement on the shot should have maybe tried to pass somehow or hit back wall there are two things that might have worked i don't know if a shot would go in from there unless it's perfect should be okay for crush be pretty easy right behind you remember a flippery set there looks so weird i'm running backward just in case i thought it'd be fine i didn't waste any boost i don't know i try to go for that on back wall though oh close wait for the pass down it's a good idea let's get dunk good shot hold on i like that go explosion it's clean satisfying for some reason try to get this right side if you're trying to learn how to force balls like right or left try to go to the opposite of where you want it to go that's my biggest tip on that it's pretty straightforward pretty simple um but it'll help you a lot if that's something you're trying to learn how to do you want to get it to the right try to go more to the left of the ball going to get to the left do the same thing the opposite over two of them [Music] should have one more touch here that's back to garrett again but always use your teammate when you can always look for where they might be it's always time to try to play threes and i have a chance to i always look for my teammates can be it's like here i'm always gonna try to like middle play for a play going forward if there is a situation where i can't pass i won't pass obviously but whatever is best to do so i will and i don't mind getting beat if it does mean that my teammates get the ball i've always tried to play for my team it's always how i will try to play i think it's the best way to play threes try to get mid right but yeah it is definitely okay to solo play sometimes too don't don't get me wrong solo playing is completely fine as long as you do the right as long as you do at the right time right you don't want to never use your teammates you want to pick and choose the right times like right there it's a good time to slow on the play my teammates aren't back yet and we're still in the play and there's no danger now because of it i'm gonna fake here i'm gonna go for a bump and my team's still gonna get the ball out of it right so those spots are the good spots you want to solo play and exactly what i was talking before you pick and choose the right times it's a hard hard thing to learn how to do but once you learn how to pick the right times to solo play or when to pass it's gonna help you a lot in your 3d game for sure i know it's a lot harder in solo queue though because you have people that aren't exactly pros on your team that's for sure um and it is like a lot harder to find the synergy with soloqueue teammates but it's still something you should try to form a habit of if you're trying to improve and get better and better i'm not trying to throw this away yet trying to stay on this make it as awkward as i can for them i'll take the boost here good fake from crow tactical fake got my boost here which is huge over one a double tap from crow oh that's a good shot it was in too auto boosting is fun there we go you go behind you should be a goal potentially good try nice good play good job to be there from garrett give me the option middle if that option is not there i can't do that right so that's a lot on my teammate to be in that position or else i don't have that passing option but yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace you
