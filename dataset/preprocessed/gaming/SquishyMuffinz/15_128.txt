today with dries who is g2's most recent member he recently replaced rizzo and he invited his friend flitz to his uh pittsburgh night sub i think so we're gonna get into some threes games for today it'll be using the brand new nascar cars from the nascar pack i think we're using the uh the ford mustang for today so i'm gonna be using the mustang for today i'll probably do a video with the camaro as well as the camry but uh for today we'll be doing the mustang huge thank you to psyonix for letting us have access and giving us a free code for today's video but yeah let's get into the game for today hopefully we can have ourselves some good games and find out how the car is all right we got a sweaty game to start it off we got uh falls nescoff and bristol this is actually a team a full team so he just goes playing a full squadron to start it off it's actually a team that kenobi had joined for a bit falls in uh nescoff i believe it was after he got kicked off rogue pretty good players as well for sure ended up um ongoing somehow the car feels quite nice though not gonna lie i play within free play a little bit it's my first actual game with it but uh i did replay with it a little bit and it feels nice it feels a lot like the dominus to me and how like crispy the turns feel something i really like about these blonde cards is the way the turning feels is a lot more like i want to say sensitive it's a lot more like reactive than octane it's the best way to explain it octane turning is like somewhat slower i don't know how to explain it it definitely is though in my opinion flip reset damn that's clean it's actually a really good shot is that that was a dominance will be set for sure like the the front half of the car ended up getting the flip you don't necessarily need all four wheels on the ball by the way for flippy says guys actually not necessarily what makes or breaks the flippery set when it comes to like long cards especially you don't necessarily need all four wheels on the ball kind of just like just below the halfway part of the ball if you get the front half of your car on it if you get it like that it's almost always going to work what you could say from them the hard thing to explain though just something i've noticed over time you don't need all four wheels on it that's why i see simple presets that you probably think shouldn't be flip resets and then end up getting them anyway a lot of pressure right now pretty hard for them to go hit the ceiling here see if they can save that let's open all them will be back wall maybe catch them off guard very good pressure though good pinch can't reach you for a shot but i can make a panic at least i'd say it's just as good especially if it gives my team the ball like i did right there go for a bump on one fine if i miss it it creates a lot of pressure hit the ceiling here i fight to myself hit it off the back wall any touch like that is good because it always just keeps creating pressure over and over again right that's all we're looking to do in those situations nice can we followed us up then touch it then i hit it to the wall gonna pass that middle to get past could say from them i played off to the right not necessarily going for a shot of that or even a pass that he can shoot just touch the heads around the opponent that's the whole goal there i'll pick up two why not go over something crazy hoping maybe you can like absolutely slam the flick off the back wall and i can follow it up good shot almost a good segment they're just stacking that and saving all these shots good demo as well i think there was a demo that opened up some space i like that you can have the black and white decal on this by the way i didn't go over the decals i'll show you guys after this game but there's a couple of decals and i believe you can only use one pair of wheels but you can use any boost i'm using the alpha boost on it right now yeah there's a couple of decals you can choose from and i'm not actually familiar with nascar myself but i'm sure some of them are from the real world if not all of them get a bump from him better recovery get his boost i just tried the wall dash on this car because it's long it just spashes it i wanna try that again oh you can't do it okay a little bit harder too seems like yeah it's a little bit harder too comes off easier but you definitely can do it i've never really tried that on dominus like the long cards in general i haven't really tried the wall dash on yeah doubling me a triple keep the ball close go for the boost here there's no real threat yet in this play got to go for a demo on the third man pressure him again here any bumps on the back line guys are huge something you should always try to look for it's definitely annoying when you're a person getting bumps but if you're the person putting pressure in that situation actually helps your team a lot it's a good read so i get his boost here i think i got the boost but it died i don't know if that's a worthy trade i think it is it spawns me back in a good position i can get full boost i end up being able to keep playing anyway should be a shot here like the idea not to rush a play it's smart try to just bump him off go over some more bumps delay the next man up we have to do much this game to be honest he had pressured the whole game pretty much and uh we're kind of just going with the flow going for the ball we had to and outside of that we're just chilling that's how i like it filling in the the gaps those are the best threes games and you can just fill in the gaps and you catch the dub again the next one though i'll show you guys the decals really quick but i was a good first up that was a good matchup good opponents there for sure let's see uh the decals are working with while i q for one more the cows decals all right so we got the another black decal here i like the black details a lot it looks super clean apparently there's a mcdonald's one this one's hot dogs so that's pretty clean i love my hot dogs i love mcdonald's and i love hot dogs so i i do i do really like these decals i'm not going to lie to you these definitely um pertain to me for sure i'm using this right now because that's the cleanest and then we got number 22 here which i'm guessing is a race here i'm not sure i'm not too into nascar myself but i'm sure you guys would know all right with the same guys for last game better get this to the right yeah i think that's white and black decal is definitely the best one best of the options i haven't tried any other cars though i'm curious which one would be the best it looks like they're all the same hitbox though so i wonder how different they even feel probably make a video on each other ones though you guys let me know if you want to see that if not then i won't if you guys want to see my thoughts on all of them then i'll definitely make a video on the other ones as well playing three's honestly isn't the best way to even like showcase a car in my opinion because you don't get like see everything about it most of the time in threes you're just trying to play the smartest way you can right trying to play in a way that's good for your team you don't have to do a whole lot a lot of the time he missed that would have been a pretty goal misread him though i tried to block his touch and ended up never actually touching it try from the trees in a fake this here you're fine baked in a good spot record still get back try this pressure in here honestly driving into that ball and not actually flipping into it probably better oops didn't mean to say that i'm scratching my arm can i have one more touch here that's fine i'm gonna get in the way it's gonna be one more time good set of challenges and the third one for boost if the shot came in a little bit quicker probably a goal but it's a really tough one to get to be honest way back over here it's at this boost there's going to be no shot here we're on the wall with a boost should be fine you can't actually follow it up it's more like a solo like a dribble attempt than a pass so it wasn't really possible for me to follow it's a good challenge there though even though you got it i mean it doesn't really matter it forces them wide that's the whole point of that all three are pushed up here it's pretty bad for them get some pads just got to be careful with the bump which i knew was coming i was just a little bit late to jump find if he hits that around shouldn't be bad forces two of them in which is actually like there i don't mind waiting an extra second if it means i lose the challenge but it baits in two of them i think that's always a a good thing to do in those situations that was a smart challenge take my time on the on the ceiling wait for the right time to challenge that got ourselves to go out of it okay don't be afraid to wait next time can be a little bit more patient on defense bait in two maybe even three and then go for this touch after the fact right also these soft touches that i'm doing to myself a lot are very good creates a lot of space for me and almost always gives me the the favor and the challenges you always want to set yourself up to be in the advantage right you never want to go into a 50 50 or a challenge at a disadvantage and if you are make sure there's a reason for your disadvantage and make sure it's gonna be the good that comes out of it so i'm gonna go into this after he wastes all of his boost and then try to challenge give me the best time to go for it and he only has one option after that guy wastes all his blue all his only option left is just take a shot and if i'm waiting and i didn't pre-jump and i didn't panic then i'm gonna have an easier time at saving that i'm gonna fake here make a panic a bit again put myself in a spot where i'm gonna have the advantage when it comes down to actually saving the ball so i'll swing out wide there past middle to try on this shot get safe from them they go back taking these pads instead of a big boost are we in a better position because of that i was able to get back get boosts as well there's something i should stall time for my team one of them just died i wanna kill time one of them follow now soft touch to myself it's a lot more pressure than if i hit that hard they also can't hit it back hard if i don't hit it hard to them try to take a quick shot touchdown from g's bump attempt i'll just go for this to keep it in getting soft touch to the corner there's a lot more pressure on them than it would if i went for a shot quickly all right hopefully i faked him there i don't know i knew i couldn't get a good touch on the ball but me jumping maybe made them think i would touch it might have helped might have been a goal regardless though i think it was a goal regardless but you never know if there's anything you could do to make it more unpredictable and make the play harder to read definitely do it especially if you're that close to getting a goal right one fake challenge here click challenge again it's fine that i die there i have two teammates behind me still it should be fine one of them goes white middle good bait really job debating two there almost to go to that as well if uh if this was waiting a little bit longer it would have probably worked out yeah that was a good good save there saving our flip to the very last moment breaking first player pass mid it's a good idea i started throwing it away take my time all right good set of games definitely played pretty well quite good as a squadron the car feels nice not gonna lie feels really nice i would recommend getting this if you like long cars only because if you're into octane i definitely wouldn't use this over the octane but if you're into long cars it feels a lot like the dominus and it looks pretty clean and if you're into nascar as well i mean why not rather than nascar i like these cars for sure so yeah pretty clean stuff good games all around we use the mustang for today i'll use the other two cards if you guys want to see those for the next two videos up to you guys completely and uh while we're at it we're trying to get up there on the leaderboards and threes and on twos we're trying to get back up to like top 20 top 10 is something like that we'll try to do that so uh yeah and i got to do my road test cell series so we got a lot to do we got a lot to do i gotta get around to all those things but there's a lot of tournaments coming up a lot of busy stuff coming up but i'll have a huge break pretty soon right after our lc season is done but i hope you guys enjoyed today's video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever happens when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and
