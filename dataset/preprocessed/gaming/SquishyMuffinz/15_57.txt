yo what's up guys today's video going to be playing some 1v1 games i've only played four of my placement games and we're currently ssl in both threes and two so let's finish off our placements and it should put some decision ones as well because i believe even without playing any replacements already 90 seconds somehow i don't even know how that's possible um but yeah after our placements will already be ssl i believe so yeah let's get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes thank you oh we got gotta sweat a game off the bat here playing uh i think this is calm from v1 so he plays a lot of ones not an easy game at all here it's either calm or it's torment one of the two i'll check after this stuff i'm pretty sure it's calmer torment his alpha boost i think this is torment he has always sunny in philadelphia guy getting the video i always use that picture i think that's him should be an interesting match here i haven't played tormund at once in a minute but we know how each other play pretty closely i'd say it's a good shot there we go good ball up there tour is really good on defense you got to take pretty perfect shots to get past them but it's more about using your space and learning a lot of options when you're playing it's a good defender someone knows how to say pretty much anything like format you have to try to make your options as you know threatening as possible something that's actually really hard to do it's a hard thing to learn a hard thing to actually practice but something that you have to be able to do hit that once just to kill time and then back off not a bad idea not a bad play it's a good save good timing on the there stop there dribble bump like the mid boost try to start a fake challenge early make them flick probably not gonna be too comfortable in those situations you can just go really fast like that i'll just check really quick see this is so my friends list let me just confirm my suspicion yep it is torment we got the c9 match up here [Music] squishy versus torments i don't think we've ever done this match in a youtube video or anything but we used to won't be one a lot we just want going for fun actually always a super close match every single time and he was like am i being the best player at stopping my i bounce dribbles the way he'd stop my bouncer with power shots he better than anybody at the time super good at it trying to stop it late to the side it's gonna be over that patient that's fine just trying to play it around me and pop it just be annoying let me get one touch here probably gonna flick pretty soon i can just wait for that is it keeping pressure and putting the ball in like awkward spots right so when someone's doing that when someone's just trying to put the ball in the bluebird spot for you just play patient don't give them what they want what they want is a bad challenge what they want is a you know free mistake from you don't give that to them easily that's going to make their life really difficult very good shot there you go it's kind of taking advantage of our opportunities right there's little openings that we're getting and it's just trying to make them as hard as possible from the reader we're going to do with those i heard him back off so i don't have time [Music] do you feel like an edible bump here actually i'm gonna fake it go low instead let him have this surgical it's going to be a hard thing to stop this is something that any good player is going to be in a really good position having the ball like that we're able to get out of it i'm trying to bump him here good try probably back for a boost i missed the mid boost again awkward situation got to be very careful in those situations but it's hard normally in a 3-3 or 2-2 match right you can just toss yourself at that you have a teammate back there's no threat at all and one's though obviously it's a lot harder to to deal with something like that you'll see his situation here also gonna be pretty difficult probably mess up my flick that's pretty much i go every time but yeah him honestly that situation you're banking on just the person messing up that's really all it is because most of the time any good player if they're in that spot they're gonna have a threatening shot i didn't get my first flip so i had to recover and try to get for a second that's what made it difficult let him hit that take my time here [Music] it's fine it works here's see what he does on the wall here he goes for a touch not a bad idea all right if i got my flick that's actually just a goal straight up mess it up a little bit i went for something crazy instead of just shooting it all good though no big deal i should have something for the shut up shop i went for a flip and i tried to pour off of it that's fine it's worth it for the content surprise didn't touch that most one play once players like to just hit that and get in the way but i'll take it kind of panicked a little bit thought i would have a perfect dribble i just faked it got a bad touch to the side and there's no threat there because i'm not really throwing myself out of the play or something like that it's a good beat let's save i'm gonna boost myself good amount of pressure here super unfortunate i got spun out there it's fine i just gotta watch the demo mainly i get the boost i missed it it's gonna instago now hit it off the back wall just in a spot that's pretty hard for him to get a shot out of it's gonna be a goal i think yeah unlucky a little bit of like unfortunate events happening but it's okay we still have 23 seconds you can get a goal for sure here go for fake you guys didn't expect it probably huge win there we go good shot there after the demo our matches are always really close like this though always comes down to the wire i get this boost is huge go for a bump here probably i just played over him but they saw him jumping he's really good at defending those so that's fine i should be dead play it safe there got the boost there it is the classic and we ended up taking the win there that's honestly how our 1v1 always went a lot of really random stuff he's super solid in that i mean it takes pretty much a perfect shot to get past him there's nothing you could do about that one and uh yeah i'll definitely definitely take that really good match up there really good first match i haven't played once in a while so i'm glad we're able to win that i know he's been grinding one so he's definitely been working on his once game it's paying off it's looking good and uh yeah let's get into one more hopefully we can play him again at the other fun match fun rematch let's get into it all right so we're able to get torment for one two two game for the last gaming episode let's get into it let's even get some dubs see how it goes all right running into mectos and twisting grape 34. pretty sure twisting grape is a pro on a smurf i've heard it was daniel pretty sure it is daniel but i'm unsure mechdosa's playstyle also in twos is kind of just stay as close to the ball as possible which works really well on twos just something that i think is like over overdone in threes so it's like kind of known what to do against it and two though it still works perfectly i think so that's why i don't think twos is like um it's a good place not to like try to mold your your threes place off of because i think things work certain ways and twos and they just don't work in threes the same way see how close it takes to the ball here he's never actually going to try to do anything with that just more so to try to bait me in i couldn't quite get around it i could try that tough angle right middle here yeah i think threes is a really good uh mode to just try to figure out how you want to play how you want to play around people learning how to rotate and stuff like that twos is more just to practice mechanics and head out play individuals but i wouldn't put too much thought into actually trying to learn how to work with people in twos because it's a very weird game mode in that aspect you can't overly pass so you'll get punished for it um stuff like that you have to like really choose your your choices in that aspect very very smartly or you're gonna you're gonna lose games for sure if you don't i'm gonna go for this again for tour if it's over me it should be fine close look at demo at least take my time here click a challenge actually a really good challenge i don't know how he won that so well don't lie it's an awkward spot for tour to be in there ended up missing which is good for us i have to watch the bumps there the classic on the way back everyone likes to do that in twos need some help hope the tour can go for me it's fine if not should have another chance on the back wall anyway very interesting straight up with there happens those misses though honestly work better a lot of the time especially if you play against pros because they expect every ball to be hit perfectly i feel like it's fine i'm just staying in front of this like how much like i made so much distance down the field i didn't flip or do anything i made it super far made them waste a lot of their boosts and stuff it's gonna be really close game it's gonna be a one goal game i think if i had to guess and the goal is gonna suck it almost always does in this mode it's almost always like an over commit a 1v2 with like a bump or something i'm just going to kill time here there's no intent of scoring this so you don't have to really do anything just let him hit it away it's fine so i should have this for free if he beats him it's a goal close it's a good try nice it's well played situation had one bumping me from behind and knew that so i had to take my time but i know the last time back it's never going to challenge there especially the way he usually likes to play he's never really a challenge [Music] i like that a lot using the bottom of my car for the 50 that we have a flip to challenge the next one as well michael's challenge for tour here doesn't matter if it scoots around me really any kind of hit on the ball is good i just have to not get fake getting fake there is pretty deadly because usually they're gonna have full control still and it's really tough for your last time back to stop a ball like that super close to the net when they have full control actually really could be i have no idea how to beat that challenge from tour off the wall for him should have a free shot now i'm for the low shot i actually really would say i figured he'd try to block the high to low and catch him off guard he'd probably just be a straight-up goal nice job to stay in front of that only 20 boosts here should be okay we're just trying to kill time in front of our net however we can try to fake him again just forcing his touch wide has zero boost so torque is insta challenge this work all right good games today i hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all [Music] off now
