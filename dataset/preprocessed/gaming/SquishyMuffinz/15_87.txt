yo what's up guys gonna be solo queueing um ones twos and threes just to see whatever we get we'll play and hopefully we can find a game pretty quick here it is really early in the morning so whatever we get we'll play let's just see how it goes all right so i ended up queuing eu and then they just see if we can find a game quickly and we actually got a game on n a so works out good for us i didn't want to have to play on bad thing should i play it around them for the shots fade away maybe my teammate can shoot as well really good job good shot it's a tough angle really tough angle for him to actually get a shot on that [Music] all right take a shot at this maybe i'm for the top corner it's a nice try i'm using slightly higher stiffness right now if my camera settings looks different that's why i'm trying to see how i like it i like the feeling of it it's going to be tough for my teammate to stop yeah it seems like the the go to play these days for most people now that uh that low 50 instead of actually going for a flick most people often low 50. take a shot you got a shot works honestly as long as it makes him waste his boost put him in a weird spot for the the next few touches to make it past this putting it around him not to go for a shot necessarily off there's no point good control again just another shot it's going to be a goal steady pressure nothing but simple shooting and just putting the ball in spots where they're not going to be comfortable saving it that's all you really have to do unfortunate only downside of cheating so close so the kickoff wasn't great for me but if he keeps a little bit further back so i'll show an example future like this using no boost but you take these two pads you can react pretty much anything that comes and then worst case scenario you're not going to have the ball go over your head like i just did back there go for a bump there it's fine i have to wait a little bit patient on this you never touch pop it should be two with that should have a free airdrop opportunity now again i like the just basic shut up shot there it's actually a good thing to do go to the ceiling oh i gotta round in that's gonna be a goal really good attempts grab the smith boost good speed there almost got the shot as well he's going to be a little boost so really up to if my teammate can win this next ball it's going to be let's do a huge i could say from them good patches on the back wall talk about it in past videos the back wall is the most overpowered thing in the situation you can do anything with the back wall and those spots can really get you out of the most awkward spots just by being there it's a good 50. go for a bump there puts a lot more pressure on them going for that bump this team has to help him out at ends up using both of their their resources there bruce wise gonna be awkward he has to jump for this there we go i'm just placing around him nice and simple you can see i haven't done anything crazy this whole game these guys are both ssl that are playing against and it's literally just a simple stuff that ends up working really well obviously i could go for like an air drop every time i don't think that's the best way to play out um bb2 it's better to use your your opportunities right and go for shots are going to put a lot of pressure on them stuff like that pop it up for teammate he should be there for me he passed it back down would have been huge but it's still a good shot like much pressure just puts on them again i don't have to go here it's going to force him to panic i'm going to panic again should be fine hit it away from him now now i can scoop up this boost let's see done gotta wait for the flip ah good try didn't quite get to it the boost that he's using there when he's like tapping it you can't even see it there's a lot of boots that are like that i think bubbles boost is like that as well if people are air dribbling it's actually like really hard to see when they're they're not boosting anymore we can try i got the boost which is huge to challenge off the first touch that's one more back now should be our ball to win nice but for his hit here all right now we have time we can make a play out of this [Music] play around one should be good actually should it be hard for him to stop let's take a shot tv does gonna have a touch here as well on the wall maybe find the past middle here i'll wait on that banging this back i think is the best bet they won't expect it he may have a free touch now maybe even a double i gotta be patient on this there's just gonna play it away play it around him he's gonna be me to that but it's fine it might be a big deal i'll pressure here but i'm not gonna actually go just stay on the ground look how much harder that is for him to go for just because i literally just drove on the floor there instead of backing off i don't actually waste my position by doing that as well which is why i like doing that so much i'm still in a pretty good spot to the challenge and be annoying there so all these times that i push up i'm actually keeping myself in a spot to follow up play every single time never really a dangerous or risky thing to go for every time i've been pushing up for it let him hit that as well it's fun two back wall made both go teammates should have put this mid maybe played ceiling now it's gonna be really awkward for the last guy back nicely done well done well done but i have to go for a shot there i'm just my main goal is to beat that guy that's up we did that and it just leaves a pretty open net pretty free opportunity for a teammate he doesn't get a job to complete point there all right let's get into the next game let's even keep it up get back to back dubs and off on uh on a good note all right for last game we got one on on european servers it's gonna be a sweaty one for sure my ping's not terrible hundred ping it's gonna be laggy for sure but it's not gonna be too bad i tried to take my time with the wall there but i was worried about getting bumped so be a little bit careful with it it's turning you're trying the shot can't have a there it should be fine though teammates should have they're doing a good job of keeping the touch to their corners good try almost the placement we're looking for fine you're just trying to get the ball away from me that's a good play anything to help out his team right there is really good but to the wall let them hit this it's fun play it over to my teammates side i can't jump for this but i can go for the boost i think it's a good play to make there make him hit this he's gonna have full control so again i'm just gonna drive up try to make him make his play and if that display that's fine it's gonna be good for us although my teammate did full commit this might actually become pretty awkward for us now if there's no danger like there was no danger back then i don't like that might you may just kind of like full rush into that definitely happens like it's easy to lose focus and make that kind of mistake kind of beat him there now you guys that won't be one kind of just threw it away unfortunate has some time here another 1v1 good try again just trying to make him show his hand early can't actually get to go out of this i know that so i don't mind just forcing him forward i don't like that again just he's a little bit too panicky on defense he's starting to ball away a lot so a lot of chances we actually could control probably gonna go out of not gonna lie but it's all good now i'm waiting for him to go and he's not going so we're in an awkward situation on defense it's not on the same page so far is the best way to explain it i'd say which happens build that well you should go here nice it's fine as long as my teammate challenges here it should be okay i can cover the ground he got bumped in my vehicle and we somehow got back to that don't know how interesting gonna fake the touch here they can respect me a little bit give me some space oh i almost got it over him i actually go against this i can't though yeah it is unfortunate it's really hard to see what's happening on the such as with with the higher ping look like i got it past them or felt like i did at least good job i don't know if you could reach it to begin with but either way it's a good bump that's why i don't like when the cheater just insta challenges or something like that like they did right there leaves him in such a bad spot like i want to go for the ball pick a winner for sure he went for the ball back there and he didn't win it and it just left him in terrible situation oops i'm gonna grab this mid boost here so like instago won't expect it most likely [Music] nice it's a good play take advantage of this space that we have and a really good challenge last man back we have a 1v2 situation and we did a good job to get out of it all right i'll take my time to stop back there for a little bit so oh that's a good play i could have beaten to the ball so in hindsight obviously i should have hit it around him i could have beat him for sure but wow that is laggy holy that was so laggy that went like left right left i don't know why i cheated so close you definitely yeah definitely you shouldn't cheat clothes on uh opposite servers like that because it's so hard to know where the ball is gonna go i'm surprised if we jump that oh good though we're down one we have a lot of time still all right it's fun so i'm really gonna do anything wow that's so laggy i didn't kill him as well gotta be server has to be i was definitely full of speed there we could boom please block it as well but i didn't block that my team is actually too pushed up as well i think he's just getting a little bit ahead of himself in some place but it hasn't been a reason for us getting scored on yet so not really a big deal there we go good first touch and good shot to follow it up as well 21 seconds left hopefully our kickoff goes well for us i'm in a really bad spot now good luck teammate oh i might have sniped it suppose i almost caught him flipping a little bit too far off first european game i've played in a while like on european servers and everyone's just really like antsy it feels like trying to move up a little bit too early something i'm noticing been a lot of mistakes that you don't i don't normally see when playing any servers but also it's a really small sample size it's been one game perfect shot top corner oh it's gonna be a goal i think kind of just played at mid i'm not actually there to help him fortunate yeah so like he knows i just went for a shot right i'm landing in their net and the first his person's thing was to try to pass again which is like a threes thing because in threes like if you go for a shot like that say i'm playing threes i go for that shot i have a player that's already ready middle to deal with whatever's gonna happen but i just landed he's instantly trying to pass to me which is not possible for me to get there obviously with no boost so again a little bit of rushing when you have way more time so you could have literally just slowed down taking control waiting for me to get behind and then went for a pass they went for play but if you're just instantly trying to like go go go go go for these plays i'm gonna work in twos uh as well as it would if you just take your time and go for more solo stuff and then wait for someone to you know rotate back and be there but either way there's a lot of little mistakes from honestly both sides there's a lot of things that probably shouldn't have been goals um but not too bad for our first european game in a while and uh we we did really well we ended up getting three goals so not too shabby hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time retailers are watching this like comment subscribe and see us on the next one i love y'all cause
