what if i told you there was a way to unlock a soldier camo in battlefield 4 that's supposed to be exclusive for developers of the game at dice and barely any members of the public still playing the game have this well the last few days i've had a few tweets from people saying hey you can unlock this now if you can remember how to do it so i racked my brains and i realized oh it's that thing a bit of context for you here the previous way to unlock this was only ever in the test version of the game very briefly as well and it never made it to the public client for whatever reason but based on what i've seen online the last couple days i wanted to go and check for myself and so that's what i did let's take a look at what happened okay so for what i recall you have to do this on paracel storm on conquest so joined a game here we'll spawn at the chinese deployment and we have to get over to think it's this one over here not windmilling to see there see there's a a boat next to it stuck there and we have to get all the way up there that's the first step okay how we're gonna get there so just for reference if you want to try this yourself it is over by the e flag the aircraft carrier that's split in half doesn't look like there's any enemies around either we'll park the river there get a better look yeah you can see the boat stuck that's the boat that actually crashes into the land as well it's a long way up there though isn't it i don't think there's a ladder i don't remember there being a ladder is there a ladder no there's no ladder okay right one day it's helicopter time i'm headed straight for it as long as i don't get shot down it's good timing [Music] there are plenty of anti-aircraft vehicles on this map padding their stats increasing their kill death ratio [Music] now it was always quite tricky to get on this i'm gonna die no we're fine okay [Music] how are we gonna do this if we go around the back very careful i'm gonna go first person mode [Music] we're just gonna very gently no we're going too far we're gonna do what left no no no no oh god not a good start i've joined another server because i was worried i was gonna run out of time i couldn't get the helicopters so this is plan c we're gonna take this jet aim upwards and we're going to jump out and see if we can parachute onto it that looks good as long as i can get in that slow bit there okay we're on nice right oh look at the view now we wait we just have to wait here for a bit and hopefully we don't get shot there's no snipers looking at me i should be all right now we're waiting there about 10 minutes now just spotting boats oh god is that helicopter seeing me just gonna try and remain perfectly still is it looking for me no no he's coming over surely not i don't have any rockets on this class no it's going away okay good so you need to wait until there's around 400 tickets left and then the storm kicks in so you can hear the rain you see the droplets on your screen and the dark clouds start to roll in it's getting pretty scary now we're nearly there here's some thunder in the sky that's good the waves have picked up everything's gone really dark oh here we go you can hear that thunder in the distance the whole mood of the map just changes but you have to stay up here what if you do do not leave there's the rain winds picking up [Music] here we go here we go okay that's it that's it so a lightning strike just hit the windmill and killed me but i wanted that to happen because that gives you the power to do what we're about to do next so we need to get over to e or near it and take this jet ski i'm gonna get that fast because the round's gonna end soon you can do this quick these waves are awesome i remember when they were marketing bf4 and they were so proud of these waves because they were service sideways man so everyone on the server had the same waves and that was a big deal back then apparently all right we're nearly there we've got to get to that little island there don't spawn on me no stop shooting you'll give me away please go yeah thank you right okay we made it we made it so we've got to go to this little island here there's the parrots on the tree and then one of these trees has coconuts this one and we have to carefully climb up the tree it's a bit tricky you can fall off like that just take your time try and go as central as possible i think we're okay yeah we're good we're good now you wait here and then somewhere in the ocean a little light will appear and then when you see that you have to shoot it it could be like in a number of places i haven't seen it yet there it is there it is okay okay right here we go and then you shoot it that's it lightning strike comes down and then somewhere in the sky there should be a the light like a ufo there it is and now we just wait here the light keeps looking around for a bit it's searching for something what's it looking for some of you may have seen this already but it's still super cool to me at least and i guess this confirms that you can do it on public service they've re-enabled it is it stopped okay yeah right it's gonna stop there it focuses on something dives down into the sea makes a splash watch this what is it it's a giant megadon of course it is why not oh it's such a cool easter egg i love it keep in mind the whole server can see that as well now the question is did that unlock the skin for me i'm gonna check lo and behold i had to disconnect from the server and join another one there it is it dies cabo and i can use it how cool is that it's true they re-enabled it from what i recall it's the only completely black camo in the game it doesn't unlock the one for the weapons though but it unlocks the one for your soldier and it looks kind of badass i like it that's how it looks on the other classes as well it's really nice man i like it a lot i don't think many people will have unlocked this yet but if you want to get it for yourself you have to do all that stuff that i just did looks kind of badass on the recon it's cool i don't know when they re-enabled this i don't remember an announcement about it or anything but maybe it didn't make a big splash at the time and that's all thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next you
