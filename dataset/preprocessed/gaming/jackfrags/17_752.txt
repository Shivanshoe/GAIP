what about shotgun can you be a Souls game at the top yeah be that guy 870 slug oh that's it camera that's wonderful okay I'll go ace23 you go with the the shotgun slug we can become the cheese Wednesday oh no sauce on fear for thinking bishop gotta be a real strong cheese I've got the shotgun pack remember this oh my god no way is that the pickup it was just on the ground now I forgot this was in the game well it was a bf3 mean wasn't it and then they just tried to they try to make it a meme in and beer for a thousand tickets this is where it's at Jack God feels sick they think they've paid bad who hit me that I don't know if you hit you then oh yes LEvolution let's go oh yeah definitely I mean if we can if we can back up and straight away then we win what keeps hitting me it's the revolution bye okay this distance how effective is this like shopping odds get i'll killed in action do not use shotguns you will be kicked tree ruin what we're going at mm hit fire only cars it's got that like cool scope on it someone in here is that oh no this plane was everywhere yes get rest yeah ice what we're looking for here I forgot this the who's the lips coming everywhere what if he's warning me can't fill on a minute please hold it's dangerous dead got one I didn't get the other one didn't even realize he was there flappy wizard he's killed me loads of times already see the guy he is the guy he's not the guy that was camping on the last map while health regen is a lot slower than you expect it to be yeah enough to a lot though didn't they yeah they stopped they stopped it regen you if you were suppressed or technical or taking damage so you wouldn't heal you oh my god there's another one here they're everywhere sometime using the plus sign here someone use the flash friend on there you're not allowed to see jack that's what it's telling you yeah I think we've managed to push them all the way back to their spawn all I wanted was some hammer I picked up this guy's kid he has an m60 right well God how many rounds in a magazine cabin in the m60 what in his one well do you remember how her knee was was it like 150 100 how many did it have when I reloaded 296 four more bullets in it for an eight second reload what am i doing why did I just suggest that we're gonna be more bullets in it before you reload I'm not sure what my brain was doing there are we three are they capping a I kind of want them to cap a you know yeah I want them to have it but thing is I think we're taking that back is this map better in battlefield 4 or battle 3 or for nostalgia bf3 I think the flanking routes in bf4 make it a better gameplay maybe I'm the best version of it that was beatified why I love operation on the ground who spread oh my God look at all the claymores in there it's the matrix I'll sacrifice myself see there you go they're all gun is the god prone out here is that all this guy inside as well he's in the ticket booth yes he's dead good job got him this guy's got such a weird loadout without a from here press ENTER I would like a suppressor and a full rib and then he's got the toads and then the spawn bhinneka that is a wacky looking loadout there's one coming down alleyway babe did not stand a chance they've also now taken C which means we can have a beer spicing up in the building you know what I really miss in this game and in bf3 was that the ping being able to ping something so your squad me yeah I'd be like that's where they are like it's such a good feature I think everybody initially saw it as a replacement for spotting and everyone's that are this is not very good but actually if you're just using it to talk to people or to like let them know where something is really helpful yeah although there is still part of me that really wishes they they put a proper compass in the game especially with how bad visible how bad visibility is I it would be really helpful right well then they're inside now they've locked us out what's happening it's from the flip-flop Oh em free 2080 camera I've got noobtube oh you did not do it never happened jack it never happened thank you just edit it out but let's play that camera why me do you say smokes out now help on it think that will help but another one then one dummy unless don't worry the door like they're everywhere old mouse one I've got two of them III do need some help though need I are in there I'm just gonna sit in the smoke for a minute look at the destruction you caused go oh thank you it's so many in there yeah there's a lot in there I wish I was support I forgot about this door yeah goes well um found a my my life has been saved I'll kill the guy called Rammstein oh yeah I've killed him a lot he just runs at you with an m60 you kill him that's good oh there's RPGs going off now a k-12 is about having I must be a new player don't worry it's only six years living the starting gun right I think it was the Chinese start ago oh no a k-12 would have been in with Russia the season was the stein gun thing for the Chinese right look so it's been a long time jack it's been a long time 2014 is camp no 2013 use camera yeah 2013 and we're all so young and full of ambition and hope coming off the back of battlefield 3 which was just super soldier simulator fine behind this are they great I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared go on Jack I got one I got one they're all coming in that was a bf3 thing like our don't worry I'll just distract them by raising someone right I know we've all died yeah we ruined don't tell me shot me through the window at the open floor you know I'm leaving this place for good that's better you know what thinking about it there's hot wind that there's the door yeah you're going to it now it's gonna say it only looks like the massive istic or massive choke actually no it's not such a small one isn't it there we go beams up the grenade for runway kill look at the mini-map I know there yes lucky to be alive they're on it all the flames that's it Oh incendiary incendiary Nate I don't want just the glass all the way through I've made it I made him into I don't know I just ran through and hit fired people with hopes by hell I wasn't gonna be like you were it works apparently oh no no it sounded like over the mtar that killed me hey some of the some of the voice acting in this game is brilliant yeah old man swamp Oh whole Mouse well vascular system mongering dress oh yeah anywhere near you gather them like sweaty me is like it's fine we'll forgive you it's Metro I'm out of ammo oh no it's happened again I'm gonna Nick that guy's KITT what is this stop bulb on with an IR envy no an m3 20 coastal BG remember that boom one Oh No the bouncer boy yeah bastard on the toilet I'm gonna reload it I'm gonna ban Sanae din there it's gonna be great watch 10 kills there we go I didn't see the ten kills come up in the kill feet right - am I missing them all there's a there's a claymore in the door why well because it's a grenade run away just just run away this is the why we're here why are we still here just to suffer I'm not sure what we were doing nearly cuz I reckon we can't easily push through this it's not gonna be an issue at all for us to push through this I don't think I don't know what I don't know why we were so worried confer see any problems or none at all there's a guy that there's a guy behind the bank the jeans over there oh yeah like picking up for the people's kids cuz like they just use things I just would never a kid switcher yeah like a bulldog with an irnv like come on there's an Ewok guy round Jack he's off our little boy out here right where is it it's come down via the lemon alleyway enemy or friendly always makes me laugh as you see them just but there's like zero apprehension when you're going into the EON walk because you completely safe it's fine isn't it it's fine oh my god I'm getting ice this is ridiculous this is why I think I like underground so much more because at least there's some movement in is the objectives yeah everyone's moving around there's multiple different flanking routes I'm rushing through screw it Leroy you're still there are you push have you pushed all the way no I'm just at the ticket booth they're gonna name you know I think if Nikki or you he's born amidst deadly Sun resume yeehaw is there a way around on the left working there I know there isn't there isn't a flanking route unless you want to like properly go in on the left hand side but we're here now we might as well keep pushing the pressure oh my god gotta be away there's got to be a way oh god we're stuck here yeah this is almost worse I'll just fire through the smoke that's all you have to do like I said this is easy Oh God hang on a minute doc I don't think I'm ever getting a kill with this thing there you go yeah picks it up again well it's classed as a shotgun and it's kicked me from the game I'm such an idiot [Music]
