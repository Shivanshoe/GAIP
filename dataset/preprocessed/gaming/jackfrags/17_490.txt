cyberpunk 2077 this is part two of my walkthrough of the game playing in 4k yesterday we ended up in the middle of a heist with jackie we're currently undercover in a hotel and we're gonna see what happens thank you for joining in today i hope you're all doing well today's stream video is sponsored by nvidia and as you can see here in the graphics settings we are playing on a rtx 3090 graphics card we've got everything on the ultra settings at 4k we're playing with ray tracing turned on as well and in this game the ray tracing delivers some nice results like shadows reflections ambient occlusion illumination effects all in real time and just gives you a really nice ambient effect of the lighting we're also using dlss which i think in this game it's dlss 2.0 and it's deep learning super sampling i've got that right and that just lets you uh play at higher frame rates while also delivering good visual fidelity it's really cool uses ai all sorts of complicated stuff that i don't really understand but the game runs good and looks good i use it on many games and it's also in cyberpunk so with that said let's get into it and continue our quests i'm really looking forward to this played for about three hours yesterday enjoyed it a lot and i'm looking forward to seeing where the story takes us so without further ado let's get into it i just skipped forward in time why'd he give it all up who gave what up yori nobu arasaka the good life i mean old news i know just got to thinkings all it's like think we've got everything right at education your pops can snap his fingers and

there's an actual terrorist in my head right now that's right johnny silverhand at his crowning moment about 50 years ago ahq bombing heard of it he's doing people say he was buried under the rubble anyway that's not what's important right now is the biochip it's basically a bomb fuse lit already you don't have much time left much life a few weeks tops silver hands construct is overriding your

saying prove it deck shots you right the bullet damaged your chip slot and your brain the biochip revived and short-circuited you and started uploading data into your head as far as it was concerned your brain was an empty vessel that needed to be filled by the engram it was carrying empty vessels but i'm right here all of this is me i won't be saying doesn't read it writes headache of yours it's the bio chip rewiring your neural pathways building new neural structures doing away with the old from where the shard city you what's left it's all a tumor that needs to be excised can't we just take the chip out or switch it off either way's out of the question you die immediately vic you've always come through for me if there's nothing you can do to help me then well what the hell do i do tell me please vic i wish i knew a kid misty he's out of luck i'm afraid [Music] you're asking too much from an old-timer like vic come on v let's get you home [Music] it's a very very bad prognosis here

by his coronary hello gridlock thank you for joining the screen screen more on the stream what's up sinclair wow wrap comrade thank you for coming along so appreciate you guys tuning in today this is part two of my walkthrough and really we've just finished the prologue i guess what is this child doing we're playing in 4k today ultra graphics with rage racing and dlss turned on big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one if you want to learn more about those graphics cards and features there's a link in the description below pablo what life path we're corpo we went corporal i figured that a lot of people would choose nomad and street kids so i went corpora instead don't like that one i think she just sent you an offer to buy a vehicle what real synthetic [ __ ] looks like oh my god it's pushing out like crazy there's still quite a few bugs in this game excuse me what is that there's an old school camper van there a military-style truck anyway we need to go and speak to this dude see what he's got in store for me i'm talking to you there he is sit you do not look so bad then in the car i doubt it you would survive it was close bit touch and go what did you actually want from me to begin you must tell me where to find evelyn parker evelyn what's it you she under your innova had intimate relations she knows how to get to him i'm thinking i would have a ward with her myself she promised to help me get rid of the chip i would not count on that she's likely gone very far away just answered your own question about where everyone is long gone why do you believe she could help you remove the chip does a cooperation help her got no clue evelyn was knowledgeable about the relic had a large chunk of classified info an enigma to be sure we're back to being our queen that slime is he getting corporal agents you know the kind i do possess this slide as you speak of you got tossed out lumped with the outcasts easily or have you forgotten sorry couldn't be of any help don't have any time to lose so hey wait i need you yorinobu arasaka must answer for this crime of patricide looking for justice in night city i seek revenge much more feasible here i have allies prepared to bring ryori noble to his knees the only thing i need is proof and you think they'll trust the word of a merc i have nothing better now also i know no one here and i am a fugitive i am hunted so what we stroll into arasaka hq and announce that yorinobu is a kin-killer that he murdered sabro we'll get the hearing before reasonable people in a neutral location certain procedures will be used to establish the truth a lie detector forget it dude in that case another option you are dying you do not know how to save yourself achieve the relic is a culprit technology made by arasaka technology they alone know this cooperation can save you as easily as it can make you disappear it is merely about getting the right people on your side politics you mean people like anders hellman

charter hill [ __ ] a slice chicks out too how can you be sure though [Music] okay cool here we go old electric core power plant in charter hill gotta make do with this for now nothing else to garner from this scroll right i don't think we've been to the power plant yet have we no time to lose we gotta go there ride with me i don't like those lights the latest polls have risen let's get going apparently some people were like concerned about that because they can trigger epileptic achieved seizures and it's the same kind of equipment that they use you can't shake it for four years i didn't read into it so i don't know everything about it all these schools [Music] but also has got a doll's implant i mean that's not a package you find lying out in the street [Music] hopefully we're going out to the city i spent the entire of the game in here so far i know in some of the trailers and the previews there's a desert area so we could be headed there now you can actually skip the ride as well no okay we're not [Music] and here we are i met him we're going in wait never did tell me why you're looking for her how do i know you won't be any worse than whatever's going on in there gotta find out who hired her whoever they are i need their help and quick otherwise i'm screwed figures wouldn't expect anything less from a merc great i'm glad now can we go find us a way inside i'll hang back scan the subnet see if there's any blueprints of the complex lying around deal join you as soon as i find something let's link on hollow till then all right going in reach the main building [Music] ah i'm not proficient enough in my technical ability there to do that cause i could just jump up oh man you get everything inside there's loads of goons there let's have a look at my inventory because i've been in a fight for a while [Music] that in slot one got two then we'll get the shotgun slot three double that up again what kind of grenades do i have frag grenade biohazard grenade recon grenade that's cool didn't even know they were in the game [Music] it's not really scanned anything has it but that didn't go down very well [Music] heard shots you still alone yeah everything's here got enough time to creep around damn this guy's a tank there'll be no dying today [Music] that wasn't him reload there's a bit of input lag on the mouse i'm dead [Music] what the hell he just started floating oh man please come down sir punch [Music] it's all right [Music] oh okay you throwing a nade at me [Music] hole saw [Music] those flashbangs are really useful so tanky oh my god can i hack that turn off yeah but hide the bodies in there i like that i've upgraded my strength though now because i can do stuff like that where you just prize open the doors cool i think there was a staircase down here found a way down you see my position yep be there in a sec wait for me hold up i'm close hold up let's go jade i'm here we need to get to level minus two bet that's weird donut sedate hear that [Music] we don't have enough methionine for today's patch get outside relax we'll add rtl and the weight will be right you're gonna be dead everything oh [ __ ] you saw me then [Music] yes you are [Music] incoming so many assault rifles really difficult to see people man when you've got like the outline and all the particle effects makes it hard to see that's a combat the gunplay is uh doesn't feel very i don't feel connected to the gun play in this game that makes sense i know it's an rpg but i just feel like the weapons they're not that satisfying to use like that sound cooler [Music] did i just get there [Music] i'm gonna have a full inventory soon [Music] let's take a look at all these new weapons that we got yeah that lmg is trash it's not the one [Music] 120 dps on that assault rifle okay put the scope on it also i don't know what's going on with my health i feel like my health is focused i don't seem to be taking any you did it [Music] [ __ ] dude just chill okay [Music] i think further on into the game we'll get some better gear better equipment better guns and all that stuff i know you can get stuff that like shoots around corners you can bend bullets you can get heat seeking bullets get mantis blades that like cook people's heads off and stuff that's a maintenance room see what i can stir up love the lighting though best thing about this game all right no survivors it's just guts everywhere i just thought my inventory out as well once gutted out all our implants and why stop there took a few internal organs while they were at it how so very resourceful scabs no matter how many you stamp out there'll always be more crawling around somewhere figure you've made their acquaintance for itself bounce back grenade i don't have enough technical ability to get in there there's a lot of doors that i'm finding like that so maybe i need to level that up i hate this place there's nobody guessing there's another way around we don't have to stand outside all day in the rain that i was gonna try and change my grenade i got a bounce back grenade or something [Music] red grenade let's go with that [Music] i genuinely think my health has brought down before because it's just stuck on whatever that is i don't seem to be taking any damage i'm playing on the normal difficulty as well [Music] headshots do so much damage though really important where are you close to the studio i think you find any useful freed up the elevator you're right there what the [ __ ] what the hell are these guys doing [Music] all right i'm here you were there the whole time no the ai is so buggy man you're in deep [ __ ] [Music] just do so many weird things johnny's in heaven just don't touch her if she's recording you'll scramble her brain wait until i cut oh i hope she's not dead grab it and tell me when you're gonna yank it i'll break the link at my end i like evelyn all right let's do this wait for my signal here goes ready and now thank god ev he's still alive evelyn you hear me [Music] let's get her somewhere safe fast too which way i sealed the doors and managed to power the elevators elevators it is then get her out there [Music] come on is it really that hard please just what for me [Music] smoking's from posers and it stinks too say whatever the [ __ ] you want but just light up no non-smokers are the [ __ ] worst just my luck we going in what's there to wait for didn't go through hell and back just to stand in front of a door she's sleeping she said at least i think she is her eyes are closed and she's not shaking anymore i would have already killed her by now if i didn't feel so bad for her you're mad at her why when you asked me to scour her behavioral chip i was just about done dealing with your [ __ ] judy i didn't have it i know it's okay so i don't get why you'll find out in a sec i'll show you the virtue i found okay show me give me a sec while i set the parameters these do guess we'll find out if our doll really did lose her tune come on v did you asleep i'll be the first to admit this does not look good well now look at you hey how you feeling you need anything i'm not here to nag just talk we should just leave her alone for now data was in pretty rough shape not all that editable glad you managed to salvage them in the first place needs a second to load quality is lousy but i did what i could 720p what am i looking out for every single piece of tech i see security we need a layout of the whole room we will get everything else we need from the virtue what about his messages only if you can do it and be puffy it's most important that he suspect nothing try to be your usual relaxed self and if he starts talking about the biochip himself should i bioship where you hear this that is not of interest to you you spin the virtue you come back here we give you the eddies that is your one job the rest is none of your concern she's like being masked out or something really weird take a look around if you want might not be important maybe all of them are from pacifica now's down our search at least what am i gonna can't see your face yeah that's under normal circumstances that kind of encryption's easy to crack but not this time whoever she is she's got serious network deleted herself from the recording somehow that or someone's working it for her what am i looking at every single piece of tech i see security we need a layout of the whole room we will get everything else we need she has a vpn is that it what about his messages it's most important that he suspect nothing try to be your usual relaxed self and if he starts talking about the biochip himself should i why would you where you hear this that is not of interest to you you spin the virtue you come back here we give you the eddies that is your one job the rest is none of your concerns understand understand oh the audio layer difficult to make out anything here hologram i think i recognize these what are they weave markings vive you familiar with them not enough to know what they actually mean heard of who might use them though who could be the voodoo boys but that's just a hunch can't be 100 sure the spine chillin that runner crew hard to find because they don't want to be i wouldn't know where to start what now looks like i'm going on a field trip to pacific pacifica all right i think we got everything cool pacifica is a completely different district of the game [Music] what do you think looks like evelyn never told us the whole truth you're telling me if i'd known what she got herself into i'm so mad at her her only job was to record a virtue it's pretty damn amazing she managed to organize a full-blown heist and swipe the biochip from under her boss's noses so that's where you came in she hired you and brought this all on herself on youtube there's one more recording wanna see it sure why not nothing can surprise me at this point french [Music] what language is he speaking i don't know haitian because voodoo boys sounded french to me wait let me see if i've got an auto translator meantime you try to tune in to the phone's frequency see what the other side's saying try scanning the phone got it give it a second [Music] we have to know what they're saying it could be important fine just found the auto translate package of course should get along fine with your system i'll install it now [Music] so they knew johnny [Music] okay judy we're good all right [Music] disconnecting [Music] i don't get it what's this have to do with johnny silverhand cool language though he died like he is right behind you judy you just can't see you got any idea long story trust me go ahead i'm all ears now's not the best time can you give me a minute i need to go over some stuff in my head um of course with johnny these people what could they want from alt how the hell should i know got no notion whatsoever one way or another everything leads back to that net runner finding hers our biggest priority if she knows as much as i think she knows about the chip she can help us out long cigarette thought you said nothing could help us no just find us that juju wirehead there's another one there let's keep spawning cigarettes interesting right guys i am going to leave it there for today thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed it this was part two we've carried on through
