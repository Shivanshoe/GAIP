hey guys hope you're well last night ea had their quarterly earnings call for 2021 and in it we got a few new little juicy morsels of information about the new battlefield game coming out later this year so typically in these earnings calls they throw a lot of numbers at the shareholders and investors and say hey look how much money we made yay but they also do drop some hints and information about upcoming games usually it's not much but last night there were actually a few things in here that i thought you guys would find interesting and it's new information that we didn't have before most notably the fact that the new battlefield game is releasing on playstation 4 and xbox one previously ea have only talked about this in a next-gen capacity saying it's optimized for next gen it's making the most of all that new next-gen hardware but last night in the q a section they did reveal that it's coming out for old generation as well and we'll dive into that in a second because i think there's a lot to unpack there we also got blake jorgensen's reaction to the reveal trailer which he said that he'd seen he's the chief financial officer at ea i'd love to tell you what i said when i saw the trailer last week i can't because we'll get censored but it's to emphasize andrew's point i think people are going to be really blown away and i'll tell you on generation 5 that's ps5 xbox series xs and pc it's even more spectacular but it will be great on either consoles but it's going to be very exciting i think they also said that the development teams are working in lockstep to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for battlefield fans the game has everything fans love about battlefield epic scale all-out warfare unexpected moments and game-changing destruction we've heard some of those keywords before there's a lot of hype there and it all takes it to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and pcs we're excited to reveal the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout this summer we kind of got the hint the other day but they are confirming that the reveal will be in june as i mentioned before our strategy is to grow battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like fifa and apex best in class gameplay deeply engaging live service a new mobile experience and more ways to play that we'll introduce to reach more players all over the world not really much new stuff there to be honest but definitely an emphasis on the live service model it seems like gaming is firmly rooted in that now especially for multiplayer fps shooters so what was said about next gen and old gen here well let's take a look andrew said answering a question yes battlefield will be available for both current gen and next gen the reference specifically from our prepared remarks was around the nature of gameplay what we can do with the fidelity of the game what we can do with physics artificial intelligence and the immersive nature of the game and in the case of battlefield what we can do with respect to the amount of players that we can have in the game and the nature of destruction in those only in battlefield moments that are truly next-gen opportunities that we're able to do in the context of our next-gen franchises because of the increased processing power and memory and output of the new consoles we're really excited about what that means for our products and andrew is being quite explicit there basically telling us what some of the major differences will be on old generation you'll have less players the destruction in the game won't be as detailed and the game won't look as good which is to be expected and they've said in the past that this game is built for next gen with more players than ever before they've hyped up the next gen console stuff so much so i would hope that the compromise here is being made for the old generation of consoles so there's more players than ever before let's say 128 next gen in pc gets 128 players ps4 xbox one get 64. the destruction isn't as good the game doesn't look as good it doesn't run as well i think that's what he's getting at here it's quite interesting that he said artificial intelligence as well and we've seen dice publicly talking about artificial intelligence in the past where they've done tests if you remember there's a video on bf1 i'll try and find it and put it on the screen now where they were testing a load of bots on the san quentin scar map and i think this was from a gdc presentation or something like that and they never actually put bots into bf1 there were some test servers on bf4 that were secret and hidden away but you could connect to them and spectate and they just had bots on them not doing anything really and if my memory serves me correctly dice just always said that this was for testing server loads but i just thought that was quite an interesting thing for andrew to mention there when referencing battlefield and next gen rightfully sir there's a lot of concerns about this because people want that next gen battlefield experience and there's this theory that if you build a game for two generations of consoles you're always going to be held back by whatever the hardware was in that last console and that will limit your scope in terms of gameplay and ideas but i think the compromise here based on how much they've said about next gen will be the old generation consoles and ultimately releasing the game on those consoles is simply because they have such a massive player base still not that many people have got a ps5 or an xbox series x sony came out a couple days ago and said that it's going to be well into 2022 before they can actually start keeping up with the demand for the playstation 5 the back orders the stock there's also a global shortage of semiconductors which are used in all sorts of computer devices so it's going to be a while still before people can actually buy and get these next-gen consoles in their homes so from a financial perspective i don't think ea can afford to ignore that old generation audience with this title especially when there's so much hype behind it as i said earlier though i do really hope that the compromise here is with the older consoles rather than the new ones from what andrew said that appears to be true but of course the proof is in the pudding if we look back at a game like bf3 on pc you had fancy graphics 64 players conquest large whereas on ps3 and 360 you had much smaller maps i think it was 24 players and of course it rendered at a lower resolution there was a couple more really juicy things about the new game and this was andrew wilson answering a question about whether the franchise is thinking about a battle royale andrew said nothing to announce at the moment on either an annualized release of battlefield and or the nature of the modes in the upcoming game we're going to talk about a lot around that in the months to come starting next month with our reveal trailer which i had the chance of seeing the work in progress last week and it's incredible what the team have been able to do in the context of next-gen consoles and epic scale battles unbelievable player count destruction is really incredible and there's some very innovative and creative modes for the future of the franchise and so you'll hear a lot more from us in the months ahead but i would just finish by saying that we're really excited about battlefield everything i've seen in the game is spectacular and i think it's going to be an amazing relaunch of that franchise this year and lead us into an incredible live surface for the future the tours have relaunched there there's been a lot of talk about this game being a soft reboot in a way of the franchise and that kind of language definitely leads into that we'll give the battlefield fans many ways to play and let them play for a long time and i think you'll see that and what we talk about in the future it's an opportunity to extend the battlefield experience for people because it's such an engaged community so it doesn't look like they're committing to any battle royale information at the moment if it even has one i don't think battlefield needs a br mode and i've always said that i'd prefer if it was a separate battlefield royale on the frostbite engine that was completely free-to-play and stand alone from the main game so the two just wouldn't interfere with each other and when you look at how much money apex legends is making for ea surely most of their focus in the battle royale genre would just go towards that and not battlefield also you should note that once again in these earnings calls there's absolutely no mention of a single player campaign and for previous titles like bf4 one and five at these type of earnings calls they did reference single-player stuff so it might be that this game just doesn't have a single player campaign and it's just focused on multiplayer only that in my opinion would be the right choice for the franchise and i'd love to see that happen wrapping things up they did talk a bit about battlefield mobile that was announced about a month ago in a separate blog but they did say that industrial toys who are the developers of this game are leading an original team and some of them actually helped create the halo franchise back in the day i didn't realize that i couldn't really find much about industrial toys online and it says that they're really committed to building a truly innovative experience around first person shooter mechanics i'm not that interested in a battlefield mobile game i have to be honest with you unless it was doing something really different and it's somehow tied into the main game but we'll keep a close on that one and see how it turns out there's obviously a lot of money to be made in mobile so i'm sure that if they make a decent game it could be incredibly popular with that said that's all for today folks thank you for watching do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a
