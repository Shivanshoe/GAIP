earlier and it was pretty good to be honest we didn't have any lag or anything so yeah I mean I would imagine there's a lot of people playing the game right now though so there might be some issues who knows hopefully this not sound resumed we're going in we're going in I took one for one day so zoom Lee a single work is it well we're not the way for nine people around us but advanced loot upgrade survivor let's go taste beta in the bottom right there doesn't it I think we're bait there's always chance I don't know I'm okay like everything a baby a child is just like you know my lad a rich alpha rich - I meet well who's that no one but sadly bond oh oh they changed it I think they change the amount to start because they it went 1 for 1 its Thank You Johnny this vision is ruined this vision it's ruined I'm not playing with ray-tracing girls tears no we do look pretty cool well don't they just touch each other with elbows now because of the thing that we can't talk about all

for the gulag I got in but yeah you'll be back you'll be back because it's do you think there'll be any one dead yet oh no you're the first I think that train to the gulag sound muted right now this is interesting I get to 1v1 someone and if I win I will respawn in the game if I lose the only way for me to get back in the game is if my teammates pay for me to get back in the game but you can actually watch them see I can throw rocks at this guy here as well.all him one man is how I fight here we go one be wrong this is like gunfight laughs now so the only way for me to respawn now is if my teammates can afford to buy me back into the game see my squad can buy me back so I should be able to spectate them now sound resumed right so I lost my gulag fight guys but you need $4,500 drop all there you go come look at that there's a buyback station near you but I don't have enough New Age profit Congrats on your we killed him nearly you just minced me I don't want to lose I think I don't want I don't want I don't want this yeah so you guys will hear this sound muted so when I'm press that button you won't be able to hear Tommy and Adam so if I want to talk to you guys and say something like answer a question without hearing the other guys talking that's how we do it and that's the reason that that notifications there so you guys know why you can only just hear me if that

of them on top of you done about the sniper north yeah go there go there this is why backup that got like $50 or something that's all right you can do some objectives and then yeah you'll be fine I

clocked out five gigahertz twenty eighty i graphics card sixteen gig of ddr4 thirty-two hundred megahertz memory I have an nvme SSD and one of the intel 900p PCI Express SSDs and that's pretty much all you need to know to be honest I guess pretty good spec but you know this is my business so I can I can expense that kind of stuff I work on my computer every day you know for recording and streaming and editing like it's I'm very lucky that I can do that kind of thing we can get back well you could win an X on the other 50% is retained sub GM by shotgun I mean the fine yeah that was not a good start well I can't believe that guy I was I won my gear like thing but the flag captures almost instantly I didn't hmm we didn't win it if he got the flag yeah but I shot him and he was dead but he got the flag before yeah but he was so he was basically dead he knew that that's what DNC must it what's the motherboard the motherboard is an Asus Rampage I think only 16 gig yeah I don't

my audio it's got multiple channels as well so I can record audio from the game from my microphone from discord teamspeak all separately it's really good and then for recording I use a program called

if I want to go super trihard i use the 1080p 240 hertz because it's just smooth as hell but if i just want the game to look good 1440p it's a acer 165 Hertz 1440p I think 1440p high frequency is the sweet spot though for PC gaming sound resumed now's a good time to warm up I'm gonna up my FPS a little bit and see if I can get away with it because it's I'm being held back what yeah only when the

another $900 and then he could respawn one of us demonic thank you for the sin its cross-platform no fat community yeah no he can't do that contract until the old ones gone this area kind of looks like Babji or maybe Daisy airfield these bunkers it's gonna be cash in there Paul 24inch at the moment we've not played plunder yet grumble back hey crazy Jay what's up are you doing guys thank you for tuning in I appreciate you what are the weapon rarity T is it's just like grey blue purple orange and occasionally you can find a red one which has got like all the attachments on sound resume all right Thank You Adam quite young get me a little bit more yeah there's a load up load up that immediately so with these you can actually get your load outs from the game think there's one zone there we go so now I've got my thermal sniper switch my m13 there's a sniper tower we can you go yeah I'm gonna get this tile defend the stairs 14 players remaining safely he's right there this is the leak the worst zoom efforts see reverse see ya unzoom me reapers cool man it's cool boss a nice little thermal scope that's got one locked in you just peaked on the war there ad [Music] campaign 4500 that is nice but obviously you need to kill them oh let's down push with that I reckon guys get in there get in there I don't even get over this wall yeah see and where he's going there there in there you would mount yeah and where he went he got him up and like when goniometer sad yes consolidate your existing money as well but just wait into these but I'll monitor the money situations you've both got enough yeah any footage done yeah it's probably gonna be your last chance to get them up anyway because it needs that's how I checked it's something up there you got a sniper and mad no no really don't know where Jesus what's this the baddie PKM those maybe your squad mates on here I see I think this is hide I'm like hiding Cassie Cassie man's let's move three jack-up it right here do you guys hear you wanna hide here well I'm legitimately scared of look at this claymores proximity mines everywhere maybe I shouldn't a shot there now yeah you just got shot from the top their notes on dates as he got honest he might do yeah how is he gonna wear that go away give to Joe probably Jack's like oh that one will only replenish that hard form is sputtering well Jack take 3 b2 CD 1 you guys have got this see if you won he's over here somewhere yeah well you understand he was play guys are crazy I think I respawn three times around yeah is pretty low is everyone that died so this is my perspective does a 14 killed games then that's it oh that contents got Hey look there's me hey I feel like on this screen here they could have your kills of your luck stacks over again into the gasps what do they go into the ghats they must have a special gas masks on the helicopter or something Jiji in the chat boys GG thank you I think you get a lot of XP for playing this this game mode you put out you put up a fair amount of damage I do remember time you played very well it's kind of YouTube yeah yes there's a playlist update available to play us up that will now be downloaded that was good for my loadout sick because I've got my sniper go slow down here the chat is going crazy guys you're insane are those proximity mines like do we like must we die I don't I mean that Claymore when I open the door Tom hey is that you know you know you must you let's go down dude you were like yeah open do you step back though didn't you yeah oh just got like a sixth sense he got accents was talking good feel the Claymore was there Brian you're 59 and still gain and that's insane I think I'll be gaming when I'm 59 years old six tons were you in the game okay Andreas how does the loadout thing works design sniper ghost sound muted so the loadout thing is interesting because you can make custom loadouts in this game obviously like I can make whatever loadout I want here and then get that in war zone and the way that works is you can either find a random loadout drop like a Supply Drop like in any other BR game like Pope G or fortnight they drop down or if you go to a buy station you can spend $6,000 if you've got it and actually spawn one in and then when you interact with it you can pick any of your load up so I made this one here for war zone which is my m13 which is like my favorite gun in the game I've got like some of my best attachments on it I suppose and then I've got a thermal sniper you actually saw me use that in that game so you can bring in your own loadout which is really interesting a doctor thank you visit to sound resumed you think it has any form of MMR pile thank you I doubt it Adam because it's just cross players and that's oh yeah get everyone together have you got any double xp stalkers now Adam cuz I just got one there no cuz it's a wouldn't click on all 54 and still gave me Bunch Bob I've not tried plunder yet so plunder is the other game mode in war zone and that's where the knight Fang skin sound that's like the same map but you start with guns and you respawn but the first the objective is to get money and the first team to make a million dollars will win the round I think I'm not played it yeah I've just seen some gameplay a bit that is the whole idea of plunder so it's all about doing objectives and also killing players at the same time and you respawn naturally like over and over again you know like in big team battle in fortnight's like that it's that kind of thing but we haven't tried that yet to be honest tonight I might just play Br but tomorrow we've got another stream so maybe we'll do plunder then we'll see Andy Kay's 34 steel gaming I think I saw someone called Paul say there were 54 sold you said 41 was still gaming 35 Ritchie yeah to be honest I reckon if I make it to like 80 years old I'm gonna be I'm gonna be that grandad that still plays games I'm down like will be having OAP LUN parties I'm telling you it seems to fix what it was doing earlier where it just look it's dying at once trail right there was a coveted codes for bidding the service from staying below 150 mark thank you for the five guys guarantee [Music] with leaving and joining crashing and this name of more iconic team of these three chaplain understand for the 20 G stop changing tooth took a legacy sweep and soup I like that the level of system carries across and as I love that show he goes you could stay here but I think we've been there we could go to like damn in the next out of the stadium can you get in it once I used in the gas it's fine isn't it barely know the stadium started it didn't that it's in the same turn so we could have started outside the government it's cool isn't it you can go watch the footballs so it doesn't appear to be open what you can't go you can't it's locked and there must be something there must be stuff grounded there right yeah let's loo not loads it was not great I prefer the HDR 50 to be honest it's a dog how do we get the dogs over in the trailer the modes their plunder so I think a Dalek nice little dog attack would have been cool on this dark some silver bullets display theme I'm good man how are you a DP and grats on the three more subs thanks I mean the map is so hugely proud laden with the Pinay its target then it should be one more left when I know that was instant about their instant then where's the third guy why the cameras said see ya use that Pro nine he was not sprayed see that spray down I still need I saw spray on well they just did

bogey right I've got enough now so I can respawn him I said getting back and you do the objective sniper it's just so cool this feature I love this and obviously that comes with all my parts isn't it well maybe we'll just keep going like it's interesting for a beer because it just really encourages people to fight you know not as comfy as other beers I've found so far I sound presuming very few system snake beckons I'm gonna get my load up their scavenger one there but here's my trihard war zone blow it out surrounds loads of objectives here it's not really an inventory system suminoe because it's not like attachment like the guns just come pre attached [Music] I'm going on our last any y'all leave this y'all get up oh I've bouncy that's good elderly I need sniper ammo it on funky nisshin's box there madam you can use that as well it's good fun hasty it's good fun you want to go for it I bounce it well I mean that area looks particularly camp again I have to be honest one of these fights I can buy a whole thing of plates yeah but you take that one there's a shop in front of us yeah we should all get my Frances is the plates like like why they instantly meme you though on the roof isn't it I don't think I saw anyone on the roof stop here we should get ya get the plates I've already got four plates I don't need them yeah how much are they good that's good very good though the battery targets dead oh we've got him goodbye lash - oh knockouts is it about self revive control where'd it go yeah well done and get me some it's Pete hey John oh the tree oh I see him packed him where is a bound oh he down me there's another guy I think there's another guy close by just straight up head shot me you can buy me back maybe can you go into the gas with a gas mask have you got enough time yeah I had one there that might be able to go in take the damage back you kidding because you could share the money but you guys have gone now yeah we're in the trees like or there's a ghost next you there odd to see that wait what do you want money watching anybody fall okay where's the nearest one if you've got a gas mask yeah Tommy you could do it if you Adam if you dropped on the money but I'll dis whatever oh yeah so I mean I don't wanna run around it interpreter super easy men we should go self resolvers to go back and buy things in other areas though we didn't need to like do that well but you could have just picked up all of his stuff straight away well no because then if you land in the gas yoga stuck in chunk 20 I think yeah cuz I I was gonna be dropping from the sky I could probably just like yeah it was like a whole squad fighting us so I think that's you know the priority tomorrow's good good at Emma it's fine I'll just understand I was getting confused just kept saying come to me you'll get to go to the gas mask um we'd I was going on cartoon thank you the nice shots in that game but just got mean by that guy with the sniper at the end there if you leave gaming get you out the party I think no King deuce a duel in session is it free yes it is it's free to play in standalone Henrique it looks slightly odd for me time two kills dead quick Claude really really quick what's up donkus pillow so yeah if you've already got modern warfare installed it's a 22 gig update if you don't have it installed it's 120 gig or like 80 gig or something if I had any performance issues declan no I haven't but I've got a pretty good PC setup so you know that can have a big effect on that obviously no lag or anything frame rates been good you know get like 200 FPS it's done we're just playing normal be are only 90 gig left it's a bit weird that they went for a lobby like this it's like a bit old like alike how he picks does it yeah it's like those lobbies were only there because of a lack of to program the unrelenting [Music] well the hit Reggie's been good hello Danny Lee your Korean Korean viewer thank you but the game over repeat the lobby right where we drop in I think we should go like Cory and then move into the circle isn't there like a mario kart track in the bottom left think so it's Mario Mario 10th anniversary is

Sonny to the Gulag nice Rob's all my gold we've got loads of cash though that's the important I don't know how you get on that roof think you have to go from a different roof and jump down on those guys about two meters away from me because I wasn't far you see makes in the go Lake is there an ascend elevator next to the descend one maybe I'm gonna go check I did start to say but Adams gonna win the gulag anyway and then he can respawn way the Gulager is it oh I found it ascend elevator here but Jack it's not the one then oh it doesn't go enough it doesn't go up enough fun can you go further

strap if that snitch okay the shield sorry I mean you know what no I'm so it's like 30 full players that's mad okay that's like half as many players you're in an apex game after one minute like you know the pace of it's just constant but just because people constantly respawn as well yeah it's constant respawning and it 150 are players to start so it's just like much redness some kind of one-on-one or this is really [Music] now it's gone just close dismissed its for so many prisoners lucky shelter down and gone from there oh yeah totally forgot I had that you could have just like so many much at said don't use it it's dog poop will scope equals aimbot I wish yeah I like it though it's good yeah it's good gents we thank you Vince funny innit I feel like when you in the open you just sitting there I've got DX era I'm doing 20 fov is a bit too much even in the in the woods and stuff like get sniped out but there's no real way you can I try days I try it might be you just don't go into the open it's this better than firestorm well I mean it takes a lot of elements from firestorm different types of game though you know very different audience I think if firestorm was free to play and stand alone like it should have been it would have been a lot popular but honestly I think this is gonna be huge like modern battle royale game I think a lot of people are craving something new in the battle rail space if you're big fans of it and the fact that this is free and anyone can just download it and start playing like and cross-platform I think a little bit is the sound I feel like I just saw basically okay like I don't hear where they are or anything but the pace is great my in the army well I just invite you again cuz I crashed yeah but which is deadly now saying you're grizzle plan go to sleep then good night thank you for watching and in a diet so you mean that's father yes yeah Jack frags I'm inviting a man called Jack pranks now are you I mean we haven't tried plunder but I need to pilot vehicle for five minutes next week firestorm will be free I don't think so Jackson Hale thank you the Sun cartoon said did you see about the vaults with keypads on the last top and is a cold sound muted yeah so I did see that I might be able to show you guys maybe in the next match there's like secret bunkers and you go underground and there's a big door with a keypad on it but it says enter the code but you don't know the code like when you press F nothing happens you just kind of pay respects right so it must be some way to get the code and get in there and I don't know what's in there I imagine there's some kind of Easter Egg or secret or maybe it's just like really good gear like awesome loot in there or something hey Elliot what's up Mads thank you so much

you're shooting people from the helicopter and then your helicopter gets shot down and it crash lands like underneath and then you work your way up through the Gulag I think you do you have to like
