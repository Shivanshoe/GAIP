i think it's safe to say that halo infinite is a massively anticipated title and while the single player is a huge draw for a lot of people the multiplayer is something that i'm personally very interested in and thanks to 343 industries we now know a lot more about what to expect during e3 this week they dropped a two minute reveal trailer followed by a big developer deep dive into the multiplayer experience there's some really cool stuff in here and i'm gonna go through all of the important bits for you first of all 343 reaffirmed the fact that halo infinite multiplayer is going to be free to play which i'm sure will be music to many players ears and it will also open halo up to a massive audience that it didn't have access to before the multiplayer will also launch simultaneously with the campaign not only that but pc players are not going to be left awaiting this time around halo is launching on pc at the same time as xbox we're finally getting a new halo experience on pc at launch what's more is that there's also cross play and cross progression speaking of that pc version though 343 have stated that halo infinite will have a premier pc experience with stuff like ultra wide and super ultra wide support advanced graphics options and triple keybinds it does give me hope that it could be a great experience on pc i hope so it's not all about pc though of course xbox series x owners can also enjoy the game up to 120 frames per second which is fantastic so let's talk gameplay then and more specifically grappling hooks this new addition to halo is probably going to divide fans but it does make for some interesting gameplay opportunities in the gameplay reveal we saw it being utilized to launch your spartan into the air before pulling off a lovely sniper shot and melee combo we also saw a spartan using it to pull explosive barrels towards them and hurl them at opponents as well as picking up weapons from the ground and around the level oh and you may want to try grappling onto vehicles too that does look like fun power-ups can now be activated manually so for example if you pick up an overshield or an active camo it now goes into your inventory and you can choose when you want to use it which gives you more options it's worth knowing too that when you kill someone and they've got a power-up in their inventory but they didn't use it you can then pick it up and use it for yourself we also got to look at some new limited usabilities from the gameplay reveal one of those was the threat sensor and this is a device that will pulse and show any enemies within a certain radius around you the repulsor on the other hand does what it says on the tin and it will deflect projectiles and anything else that comes towards it combine this with zip lines grapple shots and drop walls and you have what 343 hope to be a lot of tactical options for infinite in terms of game modes arena will still be at the core of halo infinite multiplayer with a straight-up battle between two teams of four spartans arena is all about controlling the map and scavenging items as you go controlling those weapons and pickups and that really is the essence of halo multiplayer alongside this big team battles are returning with support for up to 24 players on large vehicle-friendly maps i personally would have loved to see more than that 343 plan to share a lot on this game mode later on in the summer but it looks like that they took the modern hampton up to 11. vehicles will no longer just spawn at bases either but pelicans will drop them off around the map and there are halo 2 style weapon drop pods too that fall from the sky in terms of weaponry and vehicles that you can expect well the classic halo arsenal is there you've got the battle rifle assault rifles plasma pistols gravity hammer as well as a lot of heavy weapons there's a new vehicle here too called the razorback which does look very similar to the warthog but it's a variant and a bit bigger and it's referred to as the cousin of the water it's got a compartment at the back too that can hold power weapons fusion calls and objectives such as flags in the capture the flag game mode and even turrets they've introduced a more in-depth vehicle damage system too this was super cool and they showed off some footage of the warthog missing a back wheel because it had been shot off and of course that's going to affect how it handles it's a nice touch we saw doors bonnets all sorts of stuff coming off the vehicles it's obvious they put a lot of time and effort into this if you've played halo for a long time though you'll know that the core gameplay has been tweaked and changed over the years but largely it's felt quite similar and that means that there are always players who are going to feel a bit daunted giving multiplayer a go for the first time so this time around there's a brand new tutorial system in place that will try and ease players into the experience and this is called the halo academy and it's a separate training and tutorial area that utilizes enemy ai players can jump into a target range or choose to create a customized skirmish against ai bots they can change up the skills of the ai as well as how many there are and their loadouts enabling you to practice just how you want to you will also be able to fill out any custom game with ai as well if you choose to based on other similar game announcements it definitely seems that ai is part of the future of fps multiplayer games now with any free to play title there's usually some monetization somewhere and infinite will focus on cosmetics allowing you to buy items with real money should you wish while also having the option of progressing a battle pass but they're doing something really neat here what's great about the battle pass system in infinite is that it's permanent so if you take months off the game and you miss a few seasons you can load it up and choose a specific battle pass to work towards meaning that you'll never miss out on seasonal content if you don't want to battle past content will only ever be cosmetic items though all gameplay items will always be free there's also no loot boxes i think that system there that i've just described that's a great way of doing it but the important thing to note is that gameplay-wise you won't ever have to spend any money unless you want to and speaking of cosmetics there's a real focus this time on how your spot on looks and the customization you can change all of your armor pieces like you would expect your helmet knee pads forearms visor and then you can change and apply coatings to the armor and vehicles for that matter there are even prosthetics this time around if that's your style what all this customization does mean though is the removal of the classic red and blue team colours as such there's a new system for determining who is a friend or an enemy essentially enemies will be outlined in red to tell you their bodies but you can customize the colours of both enemies and friendlies to your liking what's incredibly unique though that i think is awesome is the ability to customize the ai announcer in the game now that isn't in itself all that new in fact you could change the announcer in the master chief collection but in infinite you can swap out the announcer of your personal ai that's giving you call outs tactical information while you play and every single different ai promises to have their own personality and voice so perhaps you can customize exactly how motivational or mean this thing is could be quite funny one extra piece of good news is the return of forge and the theater replay mode forge is a custom map editor that allows the community to make content and tools like this are really important because although levels can't perhaps be made with the direct vision of 343 in mind there are some incredible creators and creations out there that are put together without any sort of mod tools and in general allowing the community to create stuff it does make a constant flow of new content for players to try yes it's not all going to be quality but there are some incredibly talented members there that can put awesome maps and game modes together all in all i'm really interested to see how infinite stacks up especially considering it's going to be launching on pc at the same time as xbox 343 hasn't really gone into detail just yet on how they're going to manage the crossplay with the whole controller versus mouse and keyboard debate but there is going to be input-based matchmaking for the ranked parts of the game and in terms of anti-cheat clearly it's important for the developers to get this right but they have stayed away from kernel level anti-cheat solutions that games such as valorum have adopted we know they've got a server-side solution though and they claim that they've spent a lot of time securing the engine but only time will tell how effective those solutions are with it being free to play you'd hope the anti-cheat was top tier finally xbox confirmed that halo infinite will launch later this year in the holiday season but we've got no concrete release date as of yet and with that said that's all for today folks i hope you enjoyed this look at halo infinite multiplayer do let me know your thoughts down in the
