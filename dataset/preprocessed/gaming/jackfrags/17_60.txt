made a lot of money okay the eyes are green now okay i hope that the other team have done just the same thing with the other one check on the map see where they are you want the sails down yeah yeah yeah what are the front sails called is there a special word from bison mast prison mask i think so or jib now miz and master is the real one actually i think miz and although he said prison master no this is one of the other i think it's jib we should consume the meg meat to give us the strength of sharks all right i'm bringing it downstairs you've already got some cook there though let's go kicking well we'll all get a bite of the meg what look at port standing there like a young rory calhoun well he's just that he's just looking isn't he he's just looking on it's adorable i've got a hook as well i haven't seen any rats uh you go down below that you'll see him that's what's there there's more rats like when there's um when the ship starts to flood and then they obviously come up and they'll come up from the lower deck does the cat go after them oh there's one here yeah no the cat should get off them it doesn't i would like if it did take one of these how nice and then you take one thank you and then i'm just waiting for mine to cook raise it a lot aloft look we're waiting for a sharky what are you doing for us oh my god it's angry he doesn't like the meg me do you want some butt why was he angry then i don't understand he just hits us does he want it yeah i think he wants the meat oh what's wrong it was the fish isn't it cats love fish look he's sad like why because we won't give it to him can't even get it what that he hated he ate your make meat no he's really happy about that no he actually did it's gone yeah he did i thought it was still here well the entirety of that piece of meat is bigger than him there you go look he's giving i'll give him half of it now oh i see yeah there's a little animation um stop drop the anchor and stop stop whoa i like the red and black livery you've got on that that's cool on the front red and blacks for cool but big kids isn't it and they're flirting did we talk to bell or mary um take the effigy and you place it i want to put it on the table look oh placement there we go that's one of fours the other guys are bringing back the other one has the shrouded ghost been in the game already i think it's a hoax right people claim they've seen the ghost and there is a commendation in the game for getting for seeing it like in the wild but you won't get that commendation for doing this um quest because it's specifically for when it's in the wild but literally it's like a one in a thousand chance i don't even know i don't i don't have no idea how it's calculated no one knows is there any video or photo evidence of it i don't believe in it i think it's well there is video evidence but it could it could easily be an edit because they could change the med color can they we're going to go to thieves haven here's heaven right where's that jack steve's haven i see it it's south south you say we've got to go almost direct south a little bit west that's a pretty good heading there to be honest you hold that okay i'll go back to it i'm climbing in pretty much as high as it can go if you can hit the rock that'll be fine if you don't bounce that's good you're up there is this the cannon yeah that's it you gotta get your flare out from your e-menu and then load it in yeah yeah i'm loading it the meg signal flare yeah so this is number two oh yeah here we go bang right jump down oh it's like i'm back at the magic kingdom he's quite going in the dark oh you gotta hit his job twice i couldn't see what's going on because when i fired it once i had to close my eyes physically in real life i mean why because it's so bright when you fire it we've got a leak yeah i'm patching her up getting some of that water out that's all the water right now careful of the shark oh my god how's it not him he goes really fast this one he's like slinky boy in the water he's a bit faster i think he is it seems like it is coming around all right left guns left goes left goes that's two all right another side hit me in the you're banging oh yeah smash them and bang them or otherwise known as the spanx i'll go get the thing again yeah if you want there do the different colors exhibit different behavior no i don't know i don't want to seem a bit faster but i'm not 100 i think they're roughly the same there he goes he's gone belly up down into the depths there's some treasure as well yeah
