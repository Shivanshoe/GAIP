before we get stuck into the main topic of today's video let me show you a cool little easter egg slash secret that's been added to battlefield 5 in the 6.2 patch today so if you're ever playing on Wake Island and you find yourself near the oil tankers here in today's patch you can actually blow these up so if you go over to the black pipes and do damage to them up or like dynamite on them explosives whatever you can blow them up and they'll start to set on fire and eventually cause one of the biggest explosions I've seen in the game check this out that's pretty crazy I think maybe that's bigger than a v1 explosion I'm not sure but it's a really cool effect and if you go and visit the location afterwards the pipes are all twisted and there's this like just floor of molten lava fire it's awesome of course you can do it on the other one to just deal damage to the black pipe there and big boom I don't know if there's any practic called used to that but it's a cool explosion on the lesson I'm sure it could lead to some very cinematic moments so title over the video they fixed battlefield 5 well kind of so if you've been following the news you'll know that the patch came out today what it did was almost completely revert the gun damage values back to how they were in 5.0 which was when the Pacific released and then of course it all just went downhill from there when they tried to change the time to kill again and I'd say that the majority of the community the outspoken community weren't very happy about this because let's be honest it turns some of the guns into absolutely useless potato farming nerf guns there's just this massive disconnect between hey I've got an mg42 a massive machine gun but I've got to hit this guy 11 times before I take him out for me personally it just didn't feel good and it really put me off the game I think obviously I've played it in bits when new contents come out like new guns I've been covering those and new maps of course that we've had along the but today they've almost have a complete revert of what it was like in 5.0 now when I say almost it's because it's not exactly the same some guns will take one more bullet to kill than they did before but it's a damn sight better than it was and if you actually play the game it feels completely different to how it has been since I think it was five point to where they nerfed all the gun damage and I've been really enjoying it today something that we did with the two angry gamers with bogie and Tommy we actually set up a community server which does have all the proper XP and stuff now by the way and we ran a playlist of frontlines maps now frontlines I think it's a really cool game mode I think maybe it's underrated obviously it's not that popular because it seems that the majority of players want to play breakthrough or conquest conquest I'm a big fan of breakthrough I like on some maps like Hiroshima for example but on others it just gets a bit too messy for me conquest I loved on almost everywhere but breakthrough can be a bit hit and miss but we had like a nice frontlines playlist up and it was just a 32 player server as well so lots of tactics going down lots of team play and it gave me a chance to check out the new weapon values now one of the main things that I wanted to do was get back on some of the semi-auto rifles for the assault class because after five points ooh there was just practically useless also to try the VAR again and that is really nice now especially with that slower firing higher damage model really enjoyed playing with the BR today in the previous patch and I just wouldn't have touched it but today I thought it was pretty good the rebei role on the assault class excellent STG of course really good there too and 181 carbine actually good again loved using it today but the type 2a on the other hand now I wanted to show you guys this this is my stats of the type 2a on my main account I covered it in a video when it came out and talked about it because it's just a mad or p.m. machine gun it's kind of unique in its own right in battlefield 5 so I had to talk about it but then you know I realize it's pretty mad I think it's way too good at the moment especially with the 5.2 damage values because you had this insanely fast firing gun versus most other smgs and assault rifles that were putting out 8'o damage against you so it was good and it felt like the server's were just dominated by this gun and most people were playing the medic class so I used it for a bit today because they've actually increased the recall quite a lot and they've changed the damage on it I think but the recall on it now is mad it's so difficult to control it if you're shooting get anything more than I don't know I want to say like 15 20 meters away you're gonna have a bad time like trust me just try if you're on console just spawn with the type 2 a look at a wall hole right trigger don't fall down or anything and just see what the recalls like same for PC spawning don't try and control the recoil by pulling down and around on your mouse or anything just let it go and have a look and it's mad like them they've really increased the recall on it it's very unpredictable now but up close of course it still shreds like it's a beast up close and I found that it was better to just not aim down the site with it just go full hipfire with the type 2a and you can still put out some of the sick kills with it and damage but for me I like what they've done with this and it feels like it isn't going to be beating those other SMGs that it shouldn't have been beating before anymore so I think we'll see less people using it now especially on the larger conquest and breakthrough Maps so overall the gun balance today felt pretty good honestly to me it does feel like a different game again it feels like that game that we got when the Pacific came out and you feel like you're a lot more lethal now especially it close to medium range some of the damage drop off has changed a bit at longer ranges and I did notice that from time to time but not really that often there wasn't any of those moments like in the previous patch where I would just hit a guy nine times and they won't die I didn't feel like that was happening as much or if at all so I'm really happy that they've actually gone back on this but you've got to ask yourself the question and we all did didn't we when this happened like why like this this whole thing just could have been completely avoided just build on what you had originally with 5.0 which I think most people liked and work on it from there maybe you're just in small increments rather than introducing this massive sweeping change like dice did but it's done it's happened hopefully we can move on from here we go from here well I don't know to be honest with you we don't really have any announcements about what's coming next for the game the rest of the tides of war for this particular season just doesn't really have much in it but I guess we can only speculate at the moment then about what's coming up and I would play strong bets on we're going to get some new game modes on existing Maps I don't know what they'll be but maybe some interesting things with mutators or things that haven't been done in the game before you know like when they introduced grind for example but for me personally I'd love to see new map content and the eastern front introduces the Russians versus the Germans for me I think that would be my number one evolution of battlefield 5 where it is at the moment bringing a new theater of war with new assets and a new army with plenty of new weapons and tanks and vehicles and of course different locations - we've seen a lot of France we've seen a lot of the Pacific now and as such I'd love to see some of those Eastern Front environments now - I just think that would be the freshest and most interesting thing for the game in reality though maybe dice go down the US vs. German route next and look at the US versus Germany in France and some of those iconic battles that they had there that would be my second pick definitely because I feel like it might be quite similar to some of the maps that we've already got in the game but it would be cool nonetheless to see some of those iconic moments and I think maybe this is the most realistic option because they've already got the US Army and the German army in the game so they've got a lot of the assets and models and sound effects voiceover work that's already done for the US and German army so you would think well okay the next step is to build Maps maybe some live guns and vehicles and that's obviously not as much work or as expensive as developing a whole new army like the Russian army and creating only assets and environments for me like I said Russian army Eastern Front that would be my number one pick though and I think it's the best direction for the game to go in to keep things exciting before it hits end of life yes it's the more difficult and challenging option but I think for the game it's a good way forward right now because she would assume that by now lot of that team are probably working on future titles especially the next Battlefield game which we know is coming in fiscal year 22 and that probably means October 2021 and I think after what happened with the f5 and such a short development time there everyone working at dice would maybe like a bit more time to work on the game to deliver their complete vision and goals for the next battlefield game apart from that though I think maybe a bit of an outlier is like secret weapons of World War 2 correct me if I'm wrong I'm going to look this up after I do this commentary but I do recall I've got a recollection in my memory of the reveal event where it was either Daniel Berlin or andreas saying the tides of war live service content would include secret weapons of world war ii and it was only a small mention but I don't know how old you writers are or how much you know about the Battlefield franchise but back in battlefield 1942 it was actually a secret weapons of world war ii expansion where they introduced like jet engines and hover packs and more experimental weapons urban myths that kind of thing and I think they did mention it so maybe that will be after the next DLC or maybe that might even be the next who knows but aside from that I think the only other thing today was some more bug fixes we've got the tank customization - and I did have a brief look at this but there's not that many options there at the moment I think everyone gets that coming soon tank but I feel like now that system is in place they'll start to drip-feed cosmetics that you can buy with bones for example and company coin over the next few weeks or so the options that they had in there at the moment I found them quite lackluster there was a couple of cool ones like for the Sherman tank for example but I would love to see more and to be honest with you I'm expecting a lot more coming up in the next few weeks and months with that said that's all for today guys battlefield is back to where it should have been left last October and November we made it and hopefully it's onwards and upwards from here yes there are still some outstanding issues with the game a lot of people are complaining still about a team balancer and that's obviously a big issue especially in certain regions and also cheating in certain regions is apparently quite bad like the Asian regions I see a lot of complaints there with said I hope you enjoyed today's video guys if you've played the game today let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you so much
