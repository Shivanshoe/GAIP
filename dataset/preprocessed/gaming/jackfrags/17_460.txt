hi guys hope you're all doing well today we're taking a look at skill based matchmaking for the last three days i've been collecting a lot of data on the matches that i'm being put in in cod warzone and i've recorded it all made a few notes and i think i've been able to identify some patterns here to give you guys a bit of context if you weren't up to speed with things there was a website created a couple weeks ago sbmwarzone.com and this website allows you to see all of the lobbies that you've played in in warzone it gives you the average kd the median kd and then it assigns it a difficulty based on their system as to what difficulty that lobby was considering all of the players that were in it so bronze 5 would be the lowest skill lobby and diamond 1 would be the highest skill lobby that you could possibly be in and this created a lot of conversation because there's an implication that you can somehow manipulate the skill based matchmaking system to always put you in easier lobbies so let's say you're a four kill death ratio player and most of the time you're getting put in bronze and silver lobbies and there's all sorts of theories and ideas about how players could potentially be using this supposed exploit whatever it is there doesn't appear to be any definitive answer to this though and that's what makes this interesting to me other content creators have come out and made videos themselves saying hey this is how you do it or this is how i think you do it but there's no certainty to this and i wanted to test this myself to see is this actually a real thing and just see if there's any truth to it so over the last three days i've queued into 105 matches of warzone and recorded the data 100 of those games i just joined the lobby waited until i was in the plane and left so there's no kills or deaths and that means that every single time that i'm queuing my kd ratio stays exactly the same so the skill based matchmaking algorithm is looking at me for all of those games and going this is the same player with the same stats so i'll put them in x or y lobby it's also the most time efficient way of me doing things as you can see there's a lot of data here this took me a long time but the sbmn website will record my stats regardless if if i actually played that game or not all i have to do is get in the plane and leave and then half an hour later when the game's over the rank and averages for that lobby will be there and whilst like i said i do think i've identified some things here a lot of this is making assumptions and theory crafting based on what i've heard in the community and there might be something missing there might be some exploit or glitch that tricks the skill based matchmaking algorithm into thinking your full party of players are new players or something like that you know a burger or something else but based on what i know what other content creators have said i'll mainly be focusing on time of day and using a vpn to spoof my ip and make the game think that i'm somewhere that i'm not as for this exploit that people are talking about i've not seen any evidence of that and when people talk about it they don't ever actually show how to do it or provide any evidence of it so as far as i'm concerned until someone comes out and demonstrably proves again and again that this works consistently i don't believe it's a real thing okay then so what are my assumptions about how skill-based matchmaking in cod warzone works based on my experience playing the game i think it prioritizes skill and then ping and then time weighted and the reason that i think it prioritizes skill over ping is because this is a free-to-play game it's cross-play and the player base is massive and the developers would rather have on average a fair match for everyone than a lower ping i think it should prioritize ping though maybe it does again just my assumption so you start queueing for a game you are your party i think it then looks at your skill or the average skill of your party it will attempt to find a suitable skill match for you and if it's a good match and the ping is within the acceptable limits it will put you in that game and that's if the matchmaking is working at 100 effectiveness however as you'll see in the data which we'll look at next there are times when the matchmaker isn't working effectively and if it can't find a good match for you in terms of skill and it can't find a good match in terms of ping it will see that the time weighted has gone up and it will say this player has waited long enough there's an available slot for them here in this lobby but their skill doesn't really match with it they're clearly going to be better than the average player in there but because they've waited so long we're gonna put them in there so they're not waiting any longer for a game so that's when the matchmaker isn't working effectively again just an assumption but i'm trying to think about this logically so let's take a look at the data that i recorded then keep in mind this was all based off my stats at the time which was a 2.84 kd and every single lobby i joined it was using that same statistic to put me in a new game so i didn't kill anyone and i didn't die when i was gathering this data and i found some really interesting things i tested vpns i tested pc lobbies controller lobbies i tested queueing up on my own queuing up in a party all sorts of stuff the first page we're looking at here are the games that i played in north america so i use the vpn and connected to new york and this would put me in games on the east coast and it would start to swing a little bit over towards central if it couldn't find a good match for me and as you can see the first games that i queued up for were solo at 8am est and i've called this breakfast babies for good reason so my kd 2.84 and the median for these lobbies was 0.998 and the average was 1.089 so in most of these matches i'm in the top three players in terms of kill death ratio so the matchmaker gave me some pretty easy lobbies then and then i tried a bit later in the day 10am es team more people waking up and as you can see way more gold lobbies the difficulty is increasing and we also got a diamond lobby here this lobby was silver but the average kd was a lot higher 1.7 because there was a cheater in the lobby with a 90 kill death ratio activision have you not banned this person but on average you can see the kd is creeping up there and i also tried trios at 11 so again we've got more gold lobbies here median and average starts to creep up a bit from that 8am bracket and three diamonds that time and then later on in the day i didn't try afternoon but what i wanted to showcase here was sweater clock now this i would say from 6 p.m in your local time zone from 6 p.m to 10 p.m that time period is sweat o'clock and out of the 10 games that i played in that time period 8pm est all of them were diamond lobbies and you can see we're pushing up to a 1.2 nearly 1.3 kd average here and the reason for this is because this period of time is where the matchmaking the sbmm the algorithm is working most effectively because there's a lot more players in that region online at that time therefore there's going to be more matches for your skill level so if you want easier lobbies this is absolutely the worst time to play avoid 6 p.m to 10 p.m in your region and we'll talk about this a bit more later on because some really interesting things here and then after 10 p.m it tends to get a little bit easier as you can see more silver gold lobbies kd comes down a bit and on controller 11 pm more silver and more gold lobbies and the kd starts to drop as for europe i didn't test as many but we still got some good data here at sweater clock in europe at 6 pm to 10 pm bracket loads of diamond and gold games much higher kill death ratios difficult games europe 6 pm to 10 p.m that's when the matchmaker is working most effectively and then i tried a bit later after that 11 pm silver gold only one dime in that time kd comes down and then i went to the extreme i stayed up really late doing this of course as you can probably tell by the time 3am uk time loads of silver lobbies one gold two bronze less population matchmaker can't work as effectively so out of those two pages there i was queuing up for solo and trios on my own leaving the lobby not playing the game but what i also wanted to test was what happens when you play in a squad does that make a difference well this was the squad i was playing in with geeky pastimes and it's in the sweater clock time period four diamonds one silver game the silver is a bit of an anomaly that does happen and we'll talk about that in just a second but playing in a group in that sweater clock period didn't really appear to make a big difference to me at least now also was making this video yesterday i saw a tweet that was doing the rounds about a polish website and they'd produced an article where a content creator had said when we play warzone we vpn to egypt because we just get much easier games there so i thought well based on what i've tested so far in my theories why not try it we'll cue it for the 10 games like we've done for na europe see what we get and i did that and these are the results that we got so i was doing this at 12 am uk time which is 2 am local egyptian time and as you can see we got a load of bronze lobbies that's the most bronze lobbies that i'd seen in my groups of 10 and it's quite a stark difference when you compare it to some of the other groups that i was getting in n a and europe it looks a lot different i'd like to do more tests vpn into egypt but i just don't have the time at the moment it might be something i follow up with in the future but for now that's what we're looking at so what can i learn from this what do i take away from it well i've drawn this crudely drawn graph this is an awful graph but hopefully you get the picture difficulty on the y-axis time of day on the x we start at 8am difficulties pretty chill starting to ramp up slowly towards 12 noon but it's it's okay and then we go three four five it gets a bit more difficult and then between 6 p.m to about half 10 11 p.m that's the sweat zone right there you don't want to be in that zone and then after 11 p.m the difficulty starts to taper off back down to breakfast babies and this is exactly what i was expecting to see and i think that makes sense for the games that i played in europe and north america so the most important factors are time of day and the population of the server that you're connected to and the reason for that is that at those times of the day there's not as many players online so the skill based matchmaking algorithm that we talked about earlier which i think prioritizes skill and then ping and then time weighted will have a difficult time putting you or your party in an evenly balanced lobby so you'll be queueing it can't find a good match for your skill and then it can't really find a good match for your ping but it hits the limit where it's like okay well if i put these people in that server with that much ping they're gonna have a laggy game even though it might be more balanced and then it goes oh hang on a second there's a slot here in this server but it's a lower skill bracket but because the time weighted on this group or this player has exceeded the respectable level i'm gonna put those guys in that lobby where they don't really belong i think that's what's going on here that's what the data tells me and it's even more evident when you look at the 10 matches that are queued up for on the egyptian vpn 2am in the morning not as many people online a lower population of players generally speaking in that region and so the algorithm for the matchmaker falls over it can't prioritize skill it can't prioritize ping so it prioritizes time instead and it will put you in a lobby that you shouldn't be in because you've waited too long and there's no other options and so if you wanted to increase your chance of getting into lower skilled lobbies you could very easily do that by picking the times of day that you play and picking which regions that you play so if you were someone like me who lives in the uk and you wanted to have a chance of getting easier lobbies you could start at 9am and then play to noon it would be pretty chill and then you could vpn to new york they're five hours behind and get yourself into those morning games again and notice that i said i think it's a chance i don't think this is a silver bullet like it's not always going to work because sometimes the matchmaker will find a good match for you regardless of the time it might just be that certain number of skilled players line up they haven't waited too long they've got a good ping boom put them in a lobby together so it's not a guaranteed way to get easier lobbies picking the time of day picking the region using a vpn but i think you could go further than this if you really wanted to and i've come up with an analogy to try and help explain this how i visualized it in my head hey look it's another awful drawing that i've done in photoshop but bear with me so imagine for a second that you're this green guy here you're a footballer or a soccer player for the americans and you're about to take a free kick the goal is a bronze lobby that's where you want to be you want to be in that lobby but in front of you you've got the four horsemen of skill base matchmaking they're stopping you from getting in but there are several things you can do to get rid of these and give you a better chance of scoring so let's say for example you use a vpn and you connect to a low population area that defender's gone goal opens up a bit and then you pick the right time of day let's say you play in that region eight or nine am in the morning defender's gone and then you know what you play on playstation so you're gonna go ahead and disable cross play go on so now you're really limiting the amount of people that you can be matched with so you're giving the skill based matchmaking algorithm a really difficult time in accurately putting you in a balanced lobby and then if you wanted to be really keen you could go even further use a geo filter on your router so you can only ping lobbies in extremely low population areas that defender disappears now even though it's an open goal you could still mis-kick it when you start matchmaking you could still miss you could get put in a gold diamond lobby but now that you've got rid of those four defenders you've got a much much much higher chance of getting in that lobby so it's all about removing those hurdles and giving skill-based matchmaking a difficult time eventually it will get to the point where it can't find good matches for you and it will just throw you in the nearest available lobby which is probably one of a much lower skill so that's my theory based on the tests that i've done and the data i've gathered here i don't actually think many content creators and streamers and just general players are using this though and i think most of it comes down to the time that you play and the region that you're in some streamers just like to play early in the morning maybe that's the only opportunity they have to stream so they're more likely to get easier lobbies then maybe they already live in a low population area however there could be people doing this all of the time every single time that they play vpn hopping using geofilters if they cared about it that much that's entirely a possibility but as i said there are some anomalies times where the matchmaker just gives you an easy game even in that high efficiency area for sbmm which is between 6pm and 10pm depending on your location for example couple of my games here this one's from january the 9th before i started doing this testing i noticed that geeky pastimes were streaming we played a bit together before he was in trios i went in his chat on twitch and said he fancy playing quads he said yeah joined on him we queued up and it put us in a silver 2 lobby and as you can see i dropped a 20 bomb we were the third kd in the game who was the first one so these guys were the first kid in the game in terms of their overall team kd so they're all above two and our team was 0.7 1.2 1.6 2.8 so we weren't even statistically the best team in that lobby but the way it played out i was try harding i was using the dmr the mac 10. it went really well for me the team played well we all survived and this was at 10 30 p.m so it's just on the edge of the sweat zone so this was still a lot of good players around but we got thrown into a silver two lobby and this is from earlier in the same day this is one of the worst examples i can find we got myself westy benny and lachlan tactical brit and we were put in a bronze five lobby and i think this was around like 12 1 p.m uk time we should not be in this lobby this is an obvious failure of the matchmaking system because our team is heavily stacked against the rest of the lobby so that's one example where the matchmaking is obviously failed and this kind of thing is a big problem for warzone tournaments and i've always been very critical of the way that warzone tournaments are run back in may last year i did a video talking about this and i showed that if you've got controller players in your lobby you've got much more of a chance to be paired up with majority controller players and now with this on top competitive warzone tournaments where there's money on the line i just don't feel like there's any integrity or fairness there at all and if players are doing this in those tournaments i don't really see how the developers could prevent this from happening outside of running private matches where it's just the people in the tournament playing in the match but that format isn't really exciting to watch because people obviously just play to win so they're more passive they're hiding buildings they just play for the zone really which makes sense when there's tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line so they go for these kill race tournaments where you just queue up and you take your five best games or whatever it is and then whoever's got the most kills and win points will win the tournament with this kind of thing it's good in one sense because you can see the lobbies that people are getting in but on the other hand how could this possibly be fair it just can't it can't be fair whether people are intentionally trying to subvert the matchmaking system or maybe they just get thrown into an easy lobby because nothing else was available warzone tournaments need to rethink how they're doing things and most of them are sponsored by activision and call of duty so i really feel like the discourse around that will get worse unless something is said and done about this wrapping things up i just wanted to show you this this isn't a problem that just content creators streamers competitive players face this is something that is affecting the entire player base and i think it really brings up a lot of questions about the concept and the nature of how skill-based matchmaking works in cod warzone so i got tweeted out by a guy called craig volga cowboy and he said to me i know you were looking into this type of thing i really don't understand how this algorithm works when people with way higher kds than me are getting out into lobbies consistent with players of lesser skill i'm baffled and he said that recently he's had 13 diamond and three gold lobbies and i checked his profile and he's playing in the evenings uk time evening so he will get into those kind of lobbies based on what i've been testing thank you you know for the link my advice would be to queue up earlier in the day like we talked about in this video and i just said avoid that 6pm to 10 pm time period and he said to me no problem i can't due to work only time i'm able to get on is like 6 p.m onwards and sometimes even later if friends aren't on i get there will be peak times as it has always been the case with online games but i shouldn't be punished and have to sweat my balls off 24 7. for someone like craig who is probably the average gamer working from 8am to 5pm whatever his shift is the average what most people do and he wants to come on and play some games in the evening he's got around a 2kd so he's already a pretty decent player so if he's playing at that time period he will just get put in diamond lobbies and obviously perhaps he's not enjoying that every single game as he says having to sweat my balls off and this is an average gamer that plays cod warzone he has a job he's not a streamer he's not a content creator he doesn't have the liberty of being able to play games earlier in the day and potentially get those easier lobbies every experience he has of the game because he's in that top percent of players is like he's playing in a cdl match when i imagine he just wants to have a bit of fun with his mates i won't go into how i feel about skill-based matchmaking personally but i don't think it's going anywhere it's going to stick around and i highly doubt that we'll hear anything about the workings of it from the developers so it ain't going anywhere so if you're a player who is above average at the game and you can only play at peak times like craig here like he says you will have to sweat your balls off every single match the issue with this for me is that there's nothing in the game to work towards you can't see your rank and i think that with the current system you should be able to you should be able to see what rank you're in so you can at least see if you're improving and there should also be unique rewards for achieving certain ranks like unique weapon skins for reaching a certain level or a weapon charm if you get to a global elite or whatever it might be that they call it that's one of the biggest problems with espn for me when you're playing these peak times and you just get sweaty matches there's no carrots at the end of the stick there's no reward and i do think because of that people will start to drop off because it just becomes a grind with no light at the end of the tunnel it's an interesting topic for sure with that said guys i hope you enjoyed this video do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below this did take me nearly four days to put together so i'd appreciate if you left a like down below subscribe if you want to see more and also a way you can directly support me if you buy anything in the cod store whether that's a skin or a battle pass consider using my creative code jack frozen capital letters and anything you buy i'll get a bit of kickback from that and if you do that tweet me a picture and i'll include you in a video like these guys here thanks for watching guys i hope you have a great day i'll see you next time
