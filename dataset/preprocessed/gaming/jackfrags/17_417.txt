hi everyone and welcome to call of duty warzone season two we are live we are going to be checking out the new map changes the new guns the zombies the battle pass everything in season two i'm really excited for this and today we'll be playing with study wessie and the tactical brit there's a few changes when you load up the game there's a little cut scene and we've also got the outbreak event here so outbreak is a free-to-play mode in black ops at the moment separate to war zone but there's all sorts of challenges i think this is going on for two weeks or something like that we've got the new battle pass i've maxed it out straight away to level 100 and in here there are various different weapons skins all sorts of stuff this is the new main character i suppose for the start his name is naga and that's the viper skin a couple of other skins here like that's for park but there are some guns in here too this is the fara 83 new assault rifle that thing is devastating i've tried it a little bit in plunder and it will be better it's kind of like a harder hitting a max and then there's another new smg to start with along here somewhere i think i went past it didn't i free weapon there it is that's the lc10 and there are a couple of legendary blueprints at the end as well this one is a reactive camouflage and we'll be using this today it actually changes the more kills you get it actually evolves and changes colors eventually it goes bright red and orange like it's on fire kind of thing and that's the other blueprint for the new smg it's okay played with it a little bit uh if you guys buy anything in the store today whether that's the season pass skins operators whatever add my code jackfrags good way to support me and we'll be using this variant of the skin i think this is the one at the end of the battle pass the warlord looks kind of sick i like his mask it's wicked right we're gonna see if the boys are ready to play lackey i think you're going to really like the cx-9 hello i i probably will oh um you guys really like yeah we're ready to go we're kid you guys get in i'm gonna be like 15 minutes so you guys get a game in i'll shut up have fun and i'll be i'll be there in a bit cool joining your party lucky no you're not going to change your skin lachlan all right lucky you're going to be rose of course i'm going to be rose ah jack but just because it's a season 2 day doesn't change the fact that the game relies on the bdsm barbie i mean in the dark ship as well i know i'll i will be in i'll become a zombie basically zombie rose we're just going to check out the area whilst westy sorts out his dummies yeah he's already done a video already first game did you win cam no i didn't win i died to lag the servers are are a little bit laggy um i just got rushed into a building and you know he did a lovely teleport across my screen and uh one framed me it was great i did get a couple of kills with the pharah and the new the cx-9 um which is ground loop by the way yeah the new the rail mg the new psychoth pistol and the cx-9 from modern warfare are all uh available as blueprints in crates i think it's an lmg isn't it but they're not out yet you can't deny the game can't get them you can't get them like in war zone you can't get them in cold war no no no no they're modern warfare guns so you can only use them currently officially in that weird like mode in modern warfare that used to be exclusive yes you can level them up you can level them up so that then when you unlock them you'll be you know straight in so ps5 out for the lads lovely do you think it's interesting that they're adding more modern warfare guns do you reckon there's going to be more modern warfare content or is that it yeah i think so maybe this is like a final flurry you know they're like here you go verdansk is about to get nuked have some guns see you in two years thanks by infinity ward okay now you know i reckon they i reckon cold war didn't perform as well as it did they thought and the player numbers were so healthy for modern warfare they just went yep we should probably release some more stuff there it is on the map shipwreck look at that oh you can see it over there there's a little bit of in the water as well in the front part there so we're just going to be dropping there straight away and just see what happens i thought it was going to be more like here but it's actually just right there there's a bit in the water and the zombies is like a it's almost like an event like you enable it and the zombies come then you have to kill them well this is going to be fun guys thank you for coming along to the stream i appreciate you all being here what's up jerome instant ready noise guy alberto yeah we're going to drop the ship like every game to start with the deployment to the war zone hey dc free oh my god that's really loud what the hell there's no [ __ ] that's so loud oh my god we're in the ship [Music] what is that a crate oh no no no no no whoa that's insane do did we see that every match though in the play yeah they got rid of all the like the opening sounds yeah they get rid of all of that oh this isn't a bad zone really no it's not bad that's perfect because everyone everyone's gonna still go for shipwreck but yeah battle royale survival of who can abuse the paratrooper and apparently it's sideways parachutes lads okay some people are still going for wins right now just like come on quick drop superstar i'm going to land hospital amex if you can get it cam yeah wrong person jack god damn it oh sorry lucky i'll go for this one then we go for the helicopter i reckon i'm ruined i see about 75 000 people heading this way well there's going to be so many people jumping for it oh my god we're definitely very i think oh my word good luck guys have fun thank you and we're all dead no you're dead i'm fine this way if they survive they can redeploy hopefully i don't get shot out of the sky by someone foreshadowing i think that's the most people i've ever seen land on a helicopter ever earth pg the old day he made it you just didn't try hard enough oh this is a little valve someone else did get it and they've gone over there ah we're gonna set up the run there i guess i'm still that goes over it everyone will drop there yeah dude that was my first game my first game that i played the flight path started at prison right um and so it went from 148 players to 66 players the moment you could leave the plane everybody jumped oh they've changed the gulag no oh what is it now somebody there's there's no um oh god there's lots of crates and stuff they've got rid of the car and it looks more balanced oh good yeah [Music] [Applause] there's a blood spot on the ground [Applause] [Music] what's with all these precision air strikes i can't hear someone on the top here i don't know the layout of it of course we get the zombie kill access are you guys coming um coming up coming i'm on the top deck um the zombies are in the ship i guess right yeah they're in like the cargo hold behind below if you can find the yellow access key card you can open up a master there are people

just get ready for him didn't hear him at all i don't know if he's not gonna come to me he's he's at the back there okay repositioning soul team oh whole team good good it's good i've got the big gas mask as well that's actually more helpful now because they changed the way the gas works didn't they this is classified as a long range smg requires the atlantis we're going to get pushed by these guys soon what's the long range smg lucky the uh poison dart guys the gas is coming we've got to go oh we got heli yeah get to how do i get out of here teleport that guy enemy mark just use your hands we need that heli yeah we're gonna get let's get it now this is a weird vss i'll take this guys there's a statue there all right can you get out of there lucky quick all right stop quickly right if you don't win let's get a load yeah let's get it down here or uh we got time to go there maybe my station yep that's good so is it is it like banging between port and prison yeah okay very very hot i'm dropping cash here damn enough problem cash again check out these new guns than the one i have so i'm probably gonna keep it yeah did you get the poison dart one lackey i got the yeah vulture evo and poison dart yeah those are the ones you want yeah i've got the vulture and the poison dart as well okay go to one of the silos yeah yeah that's true actually there's one up to the north um there's one it's behind the construction site that one right at the um south of the map and then the one i'm millie based right yeah there's one by millie base yeah that's the one that's like split in half yeah go up there okay i can't believe there's a flawless m16 amazing god that's loud af it's quite a loud gun doesn't it so allegedly the basic suppressor is better than the agency you're i'm trying to swerve to save you no you're fine you're fine you're doing doing a good job this is the year they don't miss well they're always two radios right there right now oh there's people firing here cancel okay i'm not dead 100 i just lost my plate mid-air without ever seeing a single like doesn't look good someone's dying stop eyes on [ __ ] i can drop them down here for you that's right where exactly [Music] i think if we loop around the right we'll get behind him where did you down i'm lucky uh on redbing i don't see him you could swing your guy goes [Music] sorry it's going to ghost already okay this looks close todd people are still fighting up here on the screen there's three loaders here there's a winch hello monument lodi spagody um hold on sorry i'm in a dip at the moment on green ping lucky orange orange on orange there's rob right behind the background get my target this is tracker three one good copy let's try get back on there's one more alive here somewhere i think he's behind it moving in the enemy looks down it's done yeah that requires a bit mad okay so this is completely different this is oh there's the nuke boys it's a new there it is oh god can you go anywhere uh yeah it's the whole underground system and everything look at this holy mental there's a lot there's a lot under there there's a lot under there and did somebody just sent x yeah i did i tried to send texts the uh tried to set the nuke off uh very seriously that start nuclear war in the game do you reckon this will open up yeah there's like a big red room here that's a bit ominous isn't it oh wait oh it's got an infection rate look five percent five percent so basically once it reaches a critical point launch the news what's the missiles uh that little bit down there at shipwreck it's the five percent but the zombies are going to take over the map maybe oh it will take over prison and port then they'll spread yeah there's 11 locations on the map so technically i guess 100 would be everything but damn maybe okay did you see it damn they've added a um they've added like a little dock at damn up at the top no we haven't been there yet can you should go and have a look if you get the chance if the circle's there it's in the zone yeah could have a if you've got like a heli or a vehicle that could take you there oh they're looking at yeah we're we're ruined guys okay they're waiting for us up top by the way they don't know about the ladder yeah i don't know about the ladder am i right i think they hear me yep here enemy uav overhead being shot from downhill try and get a flank on the guys at the top [Applause] i am alive but i have no plates so and we're about to get stopped by the people he drops [Applause] there's a lot of vertical recall on this para thing guy here wasn't there yeah there's two two teams right now okay um oh god oh my god it chunks though this thing yeah absolutely detroit rank two [Applause] you get some recall attachments on this it's going to be incredible [Music] i'd like to get out of here now i've got no plates unfortunately it's fine i've got i've got plates if you want to come in here i can try and get you here you're up soldier now go sort this [ __ ] out coming to you lucky maybe i'll be alive you'll be all right strong stun okay why have they pulled it back to bite this in the gulag again it's the worst it's the worst it's a funny it's all casual it's all fun i can go get jack back in mm-hmm i'll buy some plates as well whilst these lads gone uh they've gone to the ice lake area okay which now seemingly uh anybody seen the impact craters here head now is it just me or is that does that look different they look like impact craters no that's the same that's the ice cycle isn't it yeah no no that's not the ice like ice looks to the east really what's that then i don't know it just looks different no no i'm pretty sure that's normal yeah thank you it's just where people have hit the ice there's a dead body here with uh our custom mp5 here it's always encouraging [Music] give me a field agent grip on this bad boy [Music] all right they are still fighting up on the uh the old rock or the older side well we gotta move i say we take the right hand side right yeah that's not a bad idea [Music] they're still there we're all right i think we'll be all right we need this vehicle uh i would avoid it no it's good we could we probably need it we put on an idiot jack you reckon i think so okay so he's moving faster than we can run oh no okay let's go let's go yeah it does feel like it yeah um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah lucky's back don't go for your ladylike i'm not back i'm down oh my god okay why did you say you got a kill i guess i i downed the guy earlier literally like just before i died i sniped there you go stud um ffar agency suppressor minus thirty six percent bullet velocity minus thirty nine why haven't they done this org base bullet velocity buff to six hundred mac a mac 10 agency suppressor no change in bullet velocity so the mach 10 with the agency suppressor gets to keep its bullet velocity that sounds like fun and then the tundra tundra and pelicans oh i'm not there stud you ruined him any more i don't know [Applause] coming to help i don't think there's any more just got one guy with a stun grenade so has he got a satchel he does not know he has the new gun though the fire tacticals here uh we have the movers are uh it's the uh ground loop version [Music] uav entering the ao [Applause] uh where should we go stop there's people in atc just the building just in front i think yeah look uav someone down here as well we're resting until all right so just rest over here i think the guy i just killed just got rezzed uh green yeah you've gone outside your primary you can see in third person as well i really like it yeah that's cool it changes to red though eventually yeah mine's only on blue at the moment i'm guessing because uh you need any more kills i'm just not good enough yeah it's like 10 10 kills or something it's a hit we have to say so they've inadvertently nerfed the far well yeah and the tundra and the peli rap suppressor minus thirty percent velocity so kanani a then so it's car 98 basically at the moment i think we should go under the tunnel hold on don't bother using any of the uh cold war guns they're all they're all ruined why would they do this yeah agency suppressors know if they're hard yeah well i don't think they meant to do it i think it was an accident i think it was previous value yeah basically what it was on launch of season one i don't see that being why would they do it they literally ruined half of the guns that's just men although that being said it's strange that the mac 10 kept its value it almost implies as though it was pre-meditated can we get to the fire stop real quick i wonder if the mach 10 is the guns that all the developers use when they're testing the game and so therefore they don't want to nerf their gun that they used to test the game with i don't know if there'd be that like that's tinfoil hat on there guys there you go i'm dropping that i'm gonna go up the zip i think and then jump off the roof and just hit the floor and see in the game yahoo dying again what is this what is you know they this apex weapons i'll take it uh there's someone on this roof i'm dead yes fine i don't know what is that one of the modern warfare guns i don't know what's going to look like a toy gun it's pm sexy oh that's the m60 yeah that's the m60 it's like uh some patrick's day skiing or something oh i'm being sniped being sniped it fires green splats i don't know where i'm being sniped from but i am being sniped oh god no not like this no please oh right go right go right go right go right oh are you kidding me dude how is he hit that shot because they're gods then they don't miss it's eu and i'm about to get sniped from here as well it's a great game got him i can't believe that taking direct fire right either die to a person or a die to gas because it's eu i'm just launching the game now okay [Music] i'm a celebrity get me out of here that was an interesting first game when we checked out the cargo ship and everything saw one of the bunkers i'd like to see this port area or the dam that cameron was on about yes that looks interesting it's not

but i think there will be i think what's gonna happen is they'll just like start to take over the map and we found that machine that had five percent on it i imagine the over the course of the next couple weeks the zombies you know maybe start to creep into different parts of the map because they're only down here right now it could be what's gonna happen like they start to creep into different parts of the map and then they have to use the missiles to get rid of the zombies when it gets to 100 or something destination how many new guns are there at the moment jeffrey there's two but there is another new sniper rifle coming and there's three new modern warfare guns that are being added so there's six in total for the whole season two to start with what's this take down oh my god that's

that's fine i think they've improved the gas what the actual animations of it no it looks i haven't got yeah can somebody drop me some plates yeah movie three here lucky yesterday we're taking these on one piece him arm break [Applause] [Applause] not brilliant i think it's a black ops gun yeah it feels that way please come and play our game please this guy doesn't know he's using the guy in the tower guy in the tower across the way [Applause] he does not want the smoke and the recoil on this is crazy yeah by the way the lw3 with the rap suppressor is completely ruined now absolutely ruined the tundra yeah it's completely ruined now jack okay because raven decided you're not allowed to have fun we're gonna have to get our ghost load out on the way through here yeah yeah we'll do that right so i got five kills none with the new guns brilliant [Applause] little thank god the recoil the recoil long range lc10 it's not the one over here is pushing again we've got time to get a ghost i think yeah yeah we can run through he's going to be much lower even in what yeah the loadout yeah it's in i don't like the fact that the lines are right there that bothers me i think with all the guns that raven just needs to pick one balance model bloody stick with it it's really annoying that they've ruined it again can't imagine a number of people using agency suppressors and it's all going to be awful yeah people don't even realize they don't even know yet that it's chalked that's good that's good for us yeah it's good for us but it's terrible for actual weapon variety medical supplies people would play the game all those machines that's it sorry i just want to check the bunker out it's no different apart from the zombie machine down there yeah because this is the only like monument area that hasn't been moved like this one still stayed the same we can go for the other silo yeah go for what down the coast yeah yeah it's like here somewhere isn't it that's the most wanted [Applause] [Music] cancel cancel these are gonna be hot action beginnings and and really slow endings i don't know if they've changed anything but to me it looked as though the gas was actually thicker so it was almost harder to see it well there's a little dock here this is the new area yeah or a newer this is a new this is a new area they've added that because look you can see on the minimap they've changed the um i'm pretty sure this doc's always been there yeah i recognize that i haven't seen that before yeah well no one goes there yeah they've definitely changed the outbound zone though look at the mini map you can see it they've changed they've added that in so you can you can go on it maybe they'll add boats in maybe travel to the new island i do like to be behind the seaside i say just make it into a story guys right i'm not playing for dansk anymore because they nuked it [Applause] it's here right it's a hot poggening all the way up there yeah emily left 33. this is great we'll see no one tell you what you run pretty quickly with the power in your hand lc10 makes you run almost just as fast [Applause] the i've just realized the um the power just looks like a giant mp5 yes this is what it looks like massive mp5 whack out your mp5 you think it's based off a gallow what do you think it's supposed to be yeah it's a little or like a parabellum from previous black ops it's basically what the frig is wyatt uh second circle guys there's only 32 people left so everyone got murdered at the start there's a truck coming behind me guys okay yeah just watch out for it well i don't know about you guys but yeah he's coming through he's coming straight for us lovely yeah he's got out he's going for the king isn't he ah a couple of crates have been opened over here the house has been looted guaranteed there's people here by the way there's more ah this is problem it's just one guy it's just one guy yeah i know i know but we're all we're all miles the president of the rest of the buy real time to earn your freedom soldier [Music] here comes the bullfrog man and he wants your curves did you kill that guy no yeah we got him killed you jack but there's gear here jack uh yeah new pharah new pharah uh lc10 right here [Music] yeah there's two of them now both in trucks okay well let's just get to the silo just get there there's two entrances to this silo by the way there's the silo and then down on the rocks to the right-hand side they've blown out a hole in the in the side of the hill this was a a large trungus the train's here yay let's get on the train i would describe it as an intercontinental ballistic meme soul so the statue has completely gone this statue is completely gone here this has been looted here guys by the way this is stuff zombie machine here a zombie losing ground yeah but this bunker has a second entrance yeah i just found it towel here that's interesting is it it's like a someone's blown a hole in the side of the hill and it's like smashed out to uh it's a long way down it is a long way down there's also um what is that there's like lifts and stuff that look like um they could go deeper there's some kind of weird gold eggs [Laughter] a giant egg that looks like um what is that a giant egg that kind of looks like one of the bouncing bombs from like world war two but do you know what it really is a giant egg a giant egg there's another zombie machine down there as well yeah well you could couldn't you in the future i guess so you could have zombie spawn again here although this would be mental this would be mental for zombies oh yeah the entrance is sick yeah blown right out the side isn't it your teammates are one ball it's a zombo yeah this is where i dropped it earlier this is where i found the cx-9 i'll tell you what lads if final zone is here i don't plan on moving but i mean yeah it's absolutely it's it's pogba children here you know some places and poor some poor guy building

there's a baseball one in north korea they let they drop that counterweight and then the nuke just like slings slingshots into space [Laughter] there's the red button that says yeet on it and it just [Music] yeah and the car that drove away the car that drove away let's see where [Applause] the 4x4 just got hopped into yeah yeah i think they've memed off i don't want the smoke that's what you're talking about no no no no no no no i think they're going to get there they're thinking about the smoke direction they want they're thinking about this enemy vehicle take it doesn't want this one he doesn't want it he doesn't want it okay it's just been blown up oh he's dead he's literally dead yeah he's just so we might be one of the few four-man teams left by the way look at the player numbers um should i drop you guys my cash you've got go on then i dare you hold on if it doesn't disappear guys there you go you don't mind as well oh i'll tell you that farted out oh god i have drunken coming straight down the road let's go baby let's go [Music] people over in america have been playing since 11 p.m last night and they're just still playing now so is that when it came out yeah yeah it came out like 11 p.m something like that last night i'm gonna go see if this guy had cash good gush i've got a munitions box here guys 14 people left and we're a full four man yeah this is the problem with the boat but i think people are gonna get sick of it and just play the game yeah yeah it will be a two-week meme and then everyone will be gone that's our bunty right where's the zone going uh maloney the game just like here we go have the zone kill everyone why not why not i've not killed a single person since the boat same set i revived no i don't think i will i mean loadout here is power play isn't it i don't know you can't just bought a loadout the pharah and the uh the other one the lc10 the lc10 well the pharah is using the ultralight barrel which is apparently the one that's got the fastest bullet velocity but the rest of the build is awful i mean i'm just going to slap a suppressor on it anyway oh yeah you got it don't like to be honest with you 1100 rp like velocity or whatever that is all i need right but it takes you down to seven my math is correct i think with the last four-man team left there's a guy here [Music] yeah you need the field agent for broken [Applause] i just murdered his friend i don't think it's a good idea to beat that [Applause] there's a two-man team on blue building yeah i do i've got an airstrike because i think it's two man 2v3 that's what i think it is easy oh it's team there movement okay [Music] right zone i can't believe it do you want to take that oh they're going to bank they're going for bank yeah let's take it and then that's the player i will park you oh you guys just got here guys there's a munitions box at the top start if you need it [Applause] our side for too long we must murder them i'm done you can come back he's fine he's in cover where's that other team on our right i don't know uh two different teams and i couldn't strike it could be four before we won as well 19 meters two people inside this building and the roof on the roof the fact that we both beamed him there and didn't kill him tells us enough doesn't it there's the guy on green and i could stun him but then we do work i've got the i've got the gas mask oh careful guys well i've been murdered by fog um [Applause] [Music] one left [Applause] it looks really thick i think he's underneath us he is there's one underneath the 2p2 it's all bad now that pharah is looking hot lucky it is very spicy i would say that that's a nice abs on it decoy decoy hey get up on top power play perhaps if one of them doesn't get an angle on us [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] oh [Music] second game it's a win first winner season 2 lads i'm so happy there's only going to be three more [Applause] how big was the patch [Music] anyone know what how big the patch was oh it's like 16 giggles now or something like that yeah i remind 100 because i do 16 gig for a boat let's go baby let's go baby i used unsuppressed weapons in war zone and didn't get my cheeks clapped what a title what a title dude i've only got my new guns to level five and level six this is pain pain pain that was a fun drop though man yeah it was quite nice 100 people at the ship [Laughter] level 19 on the pharah how have you done that were you doing some ranking up earlier yeah i got loads of double xp weapons as well i've got two four i've got eight nine nine double xp slogans for yeah just ranked up the entire battle pass to get the gun yeah i think it's best to save those xp soccer so until you're doing like supply runs in plunder or like yeah you can really um you can really abuse them easy peasy though easy peasy apparently it was only 18 gig for xbox patch oh oh that's not fair is it they got to download it quicker they got lower they got lower resolution assets um okay so the xm4 uh has got massively buffed xm4 extent xm4 extended barrel plus 114 percent bullet velocity all right ak-47 liberator barrel plus 114. uh stoner rpd agency suppressor minus 34 stoner rpd cavalry spec snazz plus 50 bullet velocity all barrel for the xm4 xm4 extended 114 bullet velocity that makes sense field agent 60 round mag einstein is pretty bad isn't it no agency suppressor right no wait don't don't put agency suppression apparently now the stats of the gun the stats of the attachment actually match uh the labels in the menu really okay is that what they did um yeah because it extended yeah yeah agency suppressor effective damage range and bullet velocity yeah extended barrel for the uh three times on it i don't know um [Music] led try out 60 round fast mag i wonder if this i wonder if the rear grips actually work now um uh serpent wrap ads time on that i'm just going to put a little led red dot on it yeah that's the way to do it why is the xm4 so tiny it is isn't it baby m4 baby m4 that's the sound it makes when you reload little baby m4 anyway you can put a muzzle brake on there right maybe you could yeah you could put a muzzle brake on it if i'm putting the raiders stock on it xm4 we'll try it out yeah you you want to go for a walk yeah want to go to the park yeah stud just hasn't ever changed his calling card you've changed i can't no but mine makes sense doesn't it you're captain price uh yeah because that's your 14th um account you've had isn't it that's my reverse boosting account yeah it's number four already my reverse boosting account with more kd in my other one okay someone called jennifer woods just said something in the chat that has to be a bot does this make sense at all guys to me it's a great deal to get you upset with him because he has no you are blessed weekends of you can use the part where he's not the same time he has to do something like a girlfriend to do it for jennifer if you're a real person i'm very sorry but i think you're a robot remove the agency suppressor i didn't do it in time did i you want the normal suppressor on it maybe a gamer with guns thank you for becoming a member and stuart thank you again the new smg with the xm4 maybe maybe snooze xm4 m4 combo i've already done that in the video it was quite a funny vid only agency suppressor was nerfed time for the real thing hey alan can you please do outbreak mode we might do that tomorrow night why is it so loud why is it so loud i hate it a giant egg there is zombies in war zone right yeah this is normal ozone there the cargo ship what's meta uk i think the new the pharah the new assault rifle is going to be better once you've leveled it up uh martin thank you for becoming a member i sound like dakotas he's american isn't he or canadian i don't think i stand anything like him really good fortnite players very very skilled [Music] 100 players on rebirth isn't it 150 nice 99 99 say um do you reckon people use the max 10 on that mode made it no there's no waste stud [Music] don't use the mac 10 but only use it when there's a hundred players ray the zombies are at the ship here which we're going towards now you have to activate the machine and then they spawn yeah alex it's called the pharah f-a-r-a the pharah hey tyson jennifer is a great life coach i always take her advice very sorry jennifer do zombies kill count as damage if not for kills they don't count as kills but they count as damage yeah you can level up guns on them there is a heli right behind us oh he wants me if he comes up i'm dead he's trying to kill people yeah he's going after you lucky be careful he's right behind you [Applause] it's zombies then let's go you want to go and activate now you're all pistoling each other do you see that yeah yeah all over there they're all shooting oh no no no no no i've activated the zombies i need help who's that where's the players repositioning everywhere the zombies will help me in a way easy kill zombie kill i do like the fact that they drop plates oh my god you can farm them in the corridors jack watch out oh if you punch them they don't die for like five punches oh my god that's so satisfying watch out is edit just running him over yeah someone just landed above us nice do you believe us that the zombies in the game now subscribers in my chat like there's no zombies in warsaw they're bloody here look at this they're proper like old school like um one more zombie someone got on the top good gas mask self-rest nice i know the plates have you got them yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you no player running a long player here on purple there's one at the top as well really low hp around there lucky starting again team white two might yeah oh zombie here jack another one are you kidding me i'm dead no you got more on the roof there's zombies i want no ammo taking [Applause] what was he doing there i don't know there's people on people on the roof above you okay looking pushing up to the roof there's a player there there's actually i just found someone it's gonna get meleed by the zombie there may be more flight hit mark essential jack this is really fun oh my god oh there's a zombie right behind oh my us keep moving jack keep moving having to deal with zombies and players there's no easy feat is yeah you want to get the keycard cam he's here [Music] [Applause] so is a well-placed stone westy take the shotgun and camp in the other door there's a fight kicking off oh why didn't he come back get ready is there it oh there's a stairway you didn't get that never mind no i've never seen that stairway oh crossbow is over you painted me yeah yeah left side he's still he's still behind that side left side left side left he's now going right in his middle middle middle over the place it's put me right in the middle oh he's going and there's only 71 people it's actually not too bad santiago but how many of those people are just could you grab that what then you can get one of the one of the two lads so we're seeing level 1 on the banners [Applause] it's not a new gas mask it's actually been in the game for a while it's just super rare but it looks like it's dropping quite often from the zombies crate at the end it's it gives you like 20 seconds or something it gives you a long time in the gas if you get that big one see you later bro the crossbow is the bane of any weapon in the gulag yeah oh they got enough cash to find me back don't think this place has been looted thank you let's get out of here illegally can i land on you lucky yeah i'm being hunted i don't know if they're going to rush me or whatever um new guns again why not yeah yeah i'll try the xm4 next game um yeah that's what i was gonna do and it's threat to they want me they want me they really really want me where are they i don't know illegally come on and starts instantly it's because i um i press e to jump off and then i press e to get on are they coming in yeah [Laughter] the guy just killed him screaming oh my god yeah look at this look at this crowd slide crash slide crouch slide uh cross slide uh mac 10. you got any players immediately dead cool it's a nice little substitution i think there's one left illegally yeah he's in there i killed one prior to this i kind of wanted the satchel but i don't want to drop down there again i can push with you i'm gonna stun it you ready [Music] they're still running agency suppressors was he on the roof or at the fence uh i think he was here apparently there's a new spr blueprint in the store stud finally that's the last one isn't it lucky unless they come back from gulag yeah yeah i murdered all of his mates illegally triple three why did they just climb with a ladder like this that was me that was me because they were so confident they would win but they didn't they're here again jack i could stun it you want to drop [Music] [Music] hmm i broke his armor oh brilliant just let him go let him pause no if you get a full magnet gas annoying you lost the enemy trackers how many plates they're still here though lucky that's fine i'm just gonna make this guys plates i think you just dropped your heartbeat lackey that's all right this guy's just gonna be right underneath this isn't he i'm gonna go with a big red instead okay okay we've nearly got enough for a buy that we do i'm just looking around you to see what you've got oh you could do the flag contract secure you have to deal with these guys first but yeah you need anything lucky uh no i'm good actually i've got full alley i'll go get the flag [Applause] as they rushed us the one guy i killed like he started screaming why why why why why why this happened to me i push them like babies and they kill me they kill me are one's hiding inside big glue i think oh i know it's just a glitch glitch they might have run off objective updates illegally positioning mistake we're lucky there's a whole team okay the last one is it's the start of the season they just tune up the spm don't they so you know the people coming back and have fun yeah apparently there's new spr blueprint in the store apparently there's a new one i don't think there is i don't see one it's probably in the modern warfare store the gilded gilded age too was that a pillington oh that's a beautiful pellet though that is a yeah guilted age two is a really nice looking pellet just a shame yeah and just did my video on the peli 3x and now it's irrelevant you know it's funny i was actually going to post a video last night about like how to fix your attachments in cold war and i was like they're going to bottle it tomorrow aren't they yeah just wait let's wait on that one hey guys i've just spent three days doing all the attachments oh my god every time they patch the game you just see true game dealer crying into his phone 21 more players 19 more players i was expecting more in the store yeah yeah um not much in here it's a bit [ __ ] if we're being honest [Music] yeah i reckon that spr blueprint is in the modern warfare store cam okay i might have to go and have a cheeky peek yeah yeah they did know if the agency so what we learned so far yeah they've it's uh they've massively reduced their bullet velocity i can fly it you wasted your cod points on a ram seven oh no are the new guns good jack they're okay soon pharah's going to be very good in warzone once you've maxed it definitely stephen thank you for the 10. [Applause] they're on we'll play outbreak in a different stream i might do another stream later today on outbreak but this is just all about war zone at the moment like that's you know that's the hype that's what people want to say a dank i'm sorry about that i hope you get better juan what's up hey mr are you serious dan the gas does more damage the longer you're in it is that confirmed is that 100 confirmed if that's right they collect yeah jack frags and capital letters [Music] i'd like to see a video of that where there's evidence like proof because that'd be cool um someone in my chat just said to me that the gas does more damage the longer you're in it yes that's right it stops dim glitching is that true apparently yeah it was in the patch night that's really good finally well they could have just got rid of the stim actually i actually reckon they didn't know how that glitch was occurring so they just went yep come on everyone legally legally should we go um should we go train yeah yeah it's gonna be i don't think a lot of people are gonna go it's in the past they actually release patch notes did they yeah but they didn't tell anyone that they know of the agency of the attachments really yeah half the stuff in the patch notes didn't get mentioned like it's just not that objective [Music] so we'll just stay on the train go all the way around and good drop off in here downtown yeah sounds like a plan do the flags we'll know exactly where the enzyme is so i was just looking at the um at the setup for the para for pharah whatever and you can actually put a really high bullet velocity barrel on it and then the suppressor only might like minorly cancels it out so it's about the same as running it without a suppressor right unlike the mean i'll get that yeah um you mean the standard suppressor lackey not the agency yeah so if you use the standard suppressor and then one of the extended barrels you basically get the same velocity as without any attachments at all so it's workable yeah it's definitely doable just again they've ruined it and it makes no sense compared to the modern warfare guns gotcha okay great i understand them come look at this skin what's wrong look at that oh wow that's cool is that an mp5 it is not bad objective update secure positions oh i've got a new one i've got a soul eater qbz uh new flag becca really wanted to throw it off the train you were up to something i've got um enough for loading i think i might hop off find a vehicle and buy it far ahead yeah do it go for this baby yeah we'll stick on the train it's so good wait look he's at the ship he's killed three people ranking up my uh cold war rpg guys can you imagine all the sweaty like kill race brothers every single one of them just lands on the ship instantly and just obviously there's no uh there's no kill counter for um for the for the zombies though yeah yeah zombies zombie royale was incredible illegally [Music] okay i know we need to get there first i'll get that off but it's going to push the loadout it's on the track oh no how can we get it oh no i mean oh it's pushing it it's pushing that's right when we go around a bend it will oh there he goes from the side i need plates as well we've got a lot of money gotta keep doing the flags as well we can rank up our guns whilst we do that thank you not sure about this xm4 objective nobody's gone to the monument we can check out the silence massive rankers give me a huge rank not to be confused with anything else hands on rankers you made it cameron you got to run mine proudly thanks jake i'm surprised that most of the server isn't dead we're just going to keep doing the flags guys just keep doing them look it's going to end up near the uh over here i don't know if it's nearly over here near the overhead kilimanjim killer minship we're securing the intel dodd's just chilling at the front of the train he's not even ranking his guns no my guns me ranks my big round mine right here we know where this one's gonna can i put the helicopter in the hole um put the helicopter in hard is it gonna good oh god here he goes here he goes hold the tail jack the tail hold a little bit and come keep coming forward a little bit more a little bit more okay there you go i reckon it will land on the end yeah yeah you can land it on the egg yes bang in the middle sorry

long as today mate yeah yeah cause night yeah don't use agency suppressor anymore jacob they've nerfed into oblivion so the met is gonna shift quite significantly now are you coming first oh you had the install issue broken's got the internet issue yeah and still it was great woke up even though i left my pc on all night no no download go download you had to redownload the whole of warzone stuff yes i did yeah what internet you guys thought one gig you lucky faster yeah there it is and so when you when he uploads a youtube chat like video by two seconds uh a minute and a half usually i hear you should we just get the king of the most wanted contract why not yeah go on we do love the new wombles on boars like a playlist update every day and the zombies just spread yeah maybe might well yeah i reckon i reckon look they haven't released the modern warfare guns right there they haven't released all that content yet i need help oh where you been shot from no idea uh from our north west uh i have no idea he's just in the middle of the road [Music] got an aps um to make it look good busy south or north jack have you everybody look like you came from ikea how can you hit someone with a crossbow and they don't die what you got yeah i got a tag oh there's a guy here pre-aiming me on the windows shooting me through the walls okay look how much that bounces cam yeah it's insane they're on me one of them perfectly pre-aimed the window i was about to peek because odds possibly just it's just instantly jump shot hit me oh i'm taking so many hits from these guys man [Applause] one on top of big blue down airstrike airstrike inbound we have a buyer we can get down yeah there's one there what do we pull away let's just pull off and go all the way around a hot pool do that yep go all the way away oh there's a guy in the building right next to you survive oh no yeah should be all right okay this guy's very very very accurate the ghost guy instantly took up my armor moving away yeah i think i hit that guy in the thigh because i saw the arrow sticking out of him and it didn't kill him i thought crossbow was always a one-hit kill but maybe i'm wrong [Applause] see if these guys can get to the bye no i don't think it was a connection issue moonlit i got the hit marker just didn't do enough damage it's fine [Applause] going frag [Applause] are there any guns about um m79 grenade launcher nice jack nice play highlighted me from uh west one dropping in here oh illegally i downed one of them for cdl skin there's some gear on the roof he's going to get rest and there's more satchels and stuff around you want to try and find him there's a satchel here he's crossed over to the gas station they're all they're all trying to get ahead of us and they're gonna do it if we're not careful what should we go far left then or i think our left if we can avoid them i don't think we can avoid them far right or can we what the hell that's weird [Applause] what's that pkm we gotta go go for our left yeah because otherwise they're just gonna hold us out is we know exactly where the zone's going so we should probably just play for that yep damn one i'm moving green yeah actually one in that construction building on green being piloted from the left jack uh northeast north east someone's highlighting me southwest directly southwest [Applause] there you go save that difference i took a hit there was that the guy said i just finished then northeast oh i can get around the corner i'm close to you the other side as well i need a res thank you they're on that route in front of us we're a bit ruined here we're a bit ruined they're in there it's still on the boat the green building is in though for now there's a player just the other side of their carriages literally just the other side construction site as well to the right don't just cell phones in the gas get to the new safe zone i think find you stud i'm okay okay you're fine as well they're there they're there oh we are we are we're ruined we're absolutely ruined [Applause] are they taking the building out it's just moving options it's one guy on green though so there's a chance i've suppressed him there's so much bounce to this gun man yeah you need full attachments on that the reactive camo is pretty cool though i've got to admit it looks sick af right so it's four three teams are four and so we've got the worst on the red on the red mark there's 100 a team on the red mark you said there was someone on green mark blue marker blue marker someone run over here they all fight each other i'm hit i'm [ __ ] hit they're illegally [Applause] this is going to be a big fight scratch one fragment down broke behind he's got ground loot yeah [Applause] behind you behind you guys up on the hill yeah once the scrubbing and now i'm dropping into the air so i'm getting covered they're on the gas station as well this one one more on me i think because this guy had a gun straight away where from from where from the gas station just [Music] [Applause] jack's on their side no matter what they're saying again ah we'll play they just happen [Music] tricky that was very tricky yeah the reactive camo was looking nice towards the end of the game i think the xm4 is going to be a god now that it's got that massive increase really do you mind if i just made that um class quickly yeah yeah it's cool so what was jay god saying because he's done the testing don't put the two times on it though it's it's awful for close range yeah yeah i think it doesn't match um the extended barrel that gives in crate crazy velocity doesn't it yes it just looks really short doesn't it start you're right like it's weird what the xm4 yeah bobby i don't know how about m4 well you're watching cameron i shot that guy at the bus with the car now yeah it's square in the head yep and it gave you an armor break hey come on could it have been a bit of latency maybe maybe it's ready when the bullet reaches the server yeah i think i might do xm4 next round what have i got i've got an xm4 hdr loadout yeah so basically if you use the 15.5 inch contour barrel um you get like an extra bit of velocity that kind of cancels out what you lose um from the suppressor but then if you get the ultra light you get maximum velocity on the on the pharah on the fairway yeah yeah the ultra light seems to be uh the meme um which is great good because you get that off the bat anything else you can get uh marathon stock's pretty good uh this is keep going keep going yeah because literally every crate you open everything you do with the gun suddenly like increase yeah like i definitely felt the power was good though i just didn't get a lot of uh scenarios to use yeah we've done any of the outbreak event stuff yet no you have to play outbreak yeah there's this stuff there on cold war no no half of its outbreak half of its war zone isn't it in order though cam uh but you have to do it in order i think so yeah that's the point oh no no no you don't have to you have to do to get the bonus rewards for warzone there's a pistol blueprint i've done five of nine already okay just by killing the zombies i think yeah i was unlocking a lot of um things i was unlocking like a lot of like calling cards and stuff just from killing zombies yeah the xm4 extended 114 bullet velocity increase yeah owner the stoner the rpd uh have received a plus 50 on top of the previous 80 percent with the cavalry into personalized barrels that's true you can't use the metro and the stadium parking deck and lower level are no longer accessible in warzone yeah all the metro stations are all locked off now i wonder is it because they rub it oh yeah i think no one uses it and like lackey said you know maybe it's something to do with the zombie ai ah that's a really good shot actually that's a good point i think the thing is as well if you've added a location you need to take away something else the old switch yeah but yeah i mean prior to the shipwreck arriving in the dance there were ten locations in the dansk and if the thing is already saying five percent then it means i guess they'll spread to every single location on the dansk yeah that's a good point actually makes sense yeah all it is is you come down to the station the shutter is it's closed now on both sides so you can't go down the stairs they're not there anymore so like it used to be yeah [Applause] jay gods and jacob's in the chat the update is true stop warming up stand by i'm really interested to see what the mayor is now they've changed up the cold war attachment so much everyone's loadouts are busted basically especially if you're using the profile on the mac 10 it's on those cold war weapons m16 i imagine is probably not as good anymore hey tyler much love from the vaccination line here in the uk thank you tyler good luck with that [Music] if you want a good warzone channel to watch by the way jay god's the man very good at breaking down statistics of weapons what attachments to use what they do recall patterns control spread all that good stuff go check him out [Music] gas is approaching you i'm liking how the matter has got more cold war viable weapons yeah i mean they've done that on purpose right fbi because they want people to buy cold war ultimately have to buy tears you just go to the store and then you can purchase extra tears you should get some free ones though if you're playing last [Music] season yeah it feels like maybe they have made the modern warfare weapons a bit more viable again i don't know not good i'll just i'm sorry but that was the best parachuting i think i've ever done in my life oh he's he's not he's not he's not loving that [Applause] oh i found the blueprint i played him lightning strike jack i think you'll like this one more what is it come come to the front would you like my bright pink zebra stripe rbd no i wouldn't oh my god looks like something from it looks like something from

intel secured by station which one you want this one to go up because there's not really [Music] it is no the the m4 is too much of a legend there's no way no no it's it's what i use when i do a spawner i'm just like oh that'll do that old chestnut the m4 no bullets slowed out melee only brackets i can beat you with your fists out i'll take the wheel get your fists out for the lap i'm just

need some ammo man i can't wait for the first reactive uh trace around the gun because we've now got trace around guns and reactive guns but not trace around reacted yeah but if you change any attachments do you lose the reactor yeah yeah you do brilliant so it's completely useless oh yeah because unless you want to use this blueprint hey ruined i wasn't even trying going for it i want to

stephen cyber wolf appreciate you guys maurice hey jack what do you think about all the cold war blueprints being more childless and overall less serious than the ones from modern warfare i think that's just how cold like black ops generally is maurice it's always been a bit more arcadey and casual in that respect you know and they're just merging it all together with war zones so it's going to happen i mean i it doesn't really bother me but i know some people are really into like the military and relatability of everything so the more goofy skins they just don't like them they wouldn't buy them and they wouldn't use them chris thank you for the tent sinclair quillcott thanks for the 50 hi jack why are you not playing at 4k i play it 2560 by 1440 240 hertz i've got a 4k 120 monitor

stars the teams at the top of the hill were the sweatiest men ever you just got the cdl insta jump shots dude that is that is quite literally the epitome of what we've been facing at the moment it's just because it's day one that's why everyone's on everyone and they're everyone in their dog water's on i'm not joking jack went round the corner with the m82 and the guy literally like bunny hop cs go'd him it was ridiculous oh yeah no [Applause] you're going to win this no and stodd said no not today mate you might get free yeah there you go hey where the hell do we go nowhere there's loadout boys nowhere your where do i go well there's three loadouts there which means we should stay away as far away from that's possible this this is alone yep we're gonna talk yeah we're being shocked people you got your stud i'm very glitchy though i don't know where to go uh run this way um i think no i'm trying to think no you're dead there you're 100 dead but we can stay in this rock maybe well we need to move on my way point it let's hit the house and there's someone yeah there's a team in this house there's a team up the hill how have you not been killed because i just just you love it you love to see it right i could try edward walters lc10 or mac 10 from what i've tried today matt 10. still being so in my opinion i know i'm 75 okay what does cdl mean the call of julie you can buy call of duty league skins in this game and generally the kind of players that buy them are just really like competitive players you know they tend to be uh better players that will rush you jump up and down bunny hop you know full meta that kind of thing it's just a joke for us basically broke nice i'm pushing this one on your building i'm pretty sure there's someone on the top of the hill as well he's got a sniper he didn't get time is there not going right next to you yeah i can hear him so i can hear his footsteps is he in your building he's in your building he's just stunned here no he didn't tell me he didn't work the stuns aren't working i'm a stair scam i mean that is classic fbwd baby what are you doing from earlier nice well it had mounted maybe i don't know even then you want to take that plate thank you oh that's pretty good it's fine i think am i dead it's fine i'm actually stuck okay he hates us he's up on here he's up here somewhere [Music] no eyes he's definitely there somewhere he's got perfect i'm just going to keep pretty pretty and going so dodgy started if you guys win this i want you to wear let's go banner no no no peek on my side i might get instantly seasoning he has to move you both don't have an armor man oh i've got one plate i gave you he has to physically move he can't stay there good spark he's got the m16 be careful and the dmr just fired i think oh he's being sure someone else yep [Applause] he's being done he's dead man he's dead [Music] nice now there's a full flame we died it's 4v2v1 so i mean or maybe 4v you got to push up the hill it's going to be tricky is there not someone pushing right now i didn't see it this is going to be very interesting and it's ripperoni we have to go now once peak oh day he is i'm a hit and he's a rose skin so you can see him and wow he was never going to see him anyway i mean don't worry don't worry don't worry just go go go go go go go go shoot me just camouflage in the rocks you're a chameleon yeah it's fine yeah you're there you're there you survived [Laughter] is it still not feeling particularly nice one second guys just putting um twitch rivals in my tile yeah it's rivals because this is a tournament again well every day [Laughter] i have managed to get my pharah to rank 26 though nice that's pretty that's pretty decent and the reactive camo is absolutely incredible i think that's amazing can't wait for more i'm not sure about the lc10 if i'm honest i'm going to switch that i'm not seeing the uh the new modern warfare lng yet some people tweeted me screenshots of it this morning the blueprint is called rook okay but it might be the role yeah it's probably just in the crates and you just get lucky as to whether you get it or not ever tried the scar as a sniper not really toothpick it's a good shot though scar hits pretty hard it's very good when it's mounted uh foonboy the commodore ac gaming thank you for becoming members and riley snitch thanks for the two are you gonna do a video on the new zombies thing probably gonna stream it riley uh caleb thank you for the five i've been watching your videos since the bf2 days love the content thank you for everything you do stay safe thank you caleb i dare you to pop a chucky milk i don't have any chunky milk in my house at the moment although if i went for a milkshake i'd go strawberry or vanilla i wouldn't go chocky i wouldn't do it what does ttv mean twitch tv it's to explain the joke originally in games like pubg apex h1z1 any battle royale people who were trying to grow their stream would put ttv in their game and they would stream snipe other streamers so then when they would kill them like if they killed shroud on pub g when it was really popular the idea was that they would see your name and then because you've got ttv in it they would put your username in and then go to your twitch channel so that's originally where it started but nowadays so many people have it in their names because everyone streams or a lot of people that play these kind of game stream especially in like high skill competitive lobbies because they want to try and grow their stream but people do it as a joke now ironically and we just think it's funny because in our lobbies it's just especially on pc like it's just full of people with like ttv or fbgg in their names uh it's just a funny joke to us now and a lot of people just block them because they just don't want to play against you know those kind of people that may be just self-advertising or whatever uh there's one there's one nothing wrong with it i mean there's a guy with twitch in his name you know they're just trying to make a name for themselves i guess but some people just do it ironically as a joke now as well ttv jackfrag sniper that's situated yeah a lot of people just pretend though they just do it as a joke i don't know if you can go on that other bit of the ship and you thought it was a clan tag that's a wrap it's usually a rose skin as well no you equate ttvs to attention seeking tryhards well some people might think that what's up terry siergo how's it going man [Applause] doggie dog that's it jordan are you a school ryan that's crazy wouldn't you be studying hey jack i heard you take more damage when you're staying the gas longer apparently yeah apparently nash that's true they did that to stop steam glitches isn't it yeah i'm already sick of this cutscene's gearing up it's so loud as well look at the gravel physics oh yeah why did they make the vlog so much louder than the rest i don't know dude but do it turn it down [Music] let me skip it please just let me sit in the plane let me get my refreshments from there [Music] from the c one day yeah just getting the lady with the trolley the sound of the battle pass as well when i don't know if you noticed the first time you loaded up the game that was like 50 000 game it was so loud boosted the hell out of the battle pass attacks your ears oh by the way my mine's just a black screen saying gearing up i'm not allowed to see anything else you are in the game are we going through here yeah we're going for it all right this is going to be 146

d's mackies i have to go get one now you said that influencer everyone in the chat go by mcdonald's use code jack frags and guess what you get nothing off the price of a meal god imagine if you were sponsored by mcdonald's have they started doing gaming influencers yet they did there's a there's a funny story about that is that what's that man so basically the first ever influencer that mcdonald's ever sponsored was jericho oh the streamer the twitch trainer the switch streamer jericho oh i know there's someone in the chat was like oh so um it's a whopper of a deal then and then he said oh yeah it's a whopper because he forgot that it was burger king and then and then and then he you know that's literally the absolute worst thing you could ever do on the first integration with a brand because they're literally like they were literally like that's the worst thing you've ever done so he's ruined it for all of us yeah and then mcdonald's have never sponsored anyone again but they haven't pieced on people directly because it's that for them it's just too much of a brand risk yeah because like you know even just the mention of the word because you know in some in some games you know you're playing apex you might mention other games resurgence extreme is uh trios no one more death some absolute resurgence okay i'm sticking on for some memes absolutely 100 players it's gonna just be a laggy mess is that really the only spawning they've done for gaming no they do other sponsors for gaming but just not in the same way anymore i mean do they really they don't really need to spend do they like you know what's mcdonald's i've never heard of it yeah like one of the few brands in the world who literally wouldn't they'd never have to advertise and you wouldn't know and today's video is sponsored by mcdonald's and at mcdonald's it's a restaurant we can get takeaway fast food and here's what they call a big mac here's a big whopper oh no [Laughter] it's where you go after you have your manchester muriel evening man on the ground with his pine fight in the background for real though if anyone from mcdonald's uk is watching please sponsor me yeah we know we know the difference between you know we're not going to say whopper yeah it's big big mac big mcdonald's nando's or is right i was thinking about this the other day if mcdonald's like sponsored a gaming team or something would they make them wear the colors the same uniforms if you're until dude if it was mcdonald's by mcdonald's and they have to wear the caps yeah they could all dress up like ronald mcdonald like red and blue like red shorts yeah hamburg what about the hamburglar team captains put your damn uniform on hasn't no no hasn't ronald mcdonald been like he's been stood down because of all of the killer claims like let's not be associated with this to be fair i i think there's kind of a way you can identify if you're in a dodgy area so i was in birmingham once like really late at night with some friends dangerous mcdonald's had a security guard and i was like all right that's that's the kind of area we're in was it a saturday when um when i worked at mcdonald's um uh the store that i worked at we used to have to have um a bodyguard at night because we were about three are we about three doors away from a nightclub so all these like super drunk lads would try and come in we have to have two bodyguards on that make sense friday and saturday nights i think she makes his milkshake off his forehead you're not far away from the truth there [Music] [Applause] lucky and remember [Music] [Music] not zombies anymore it's just ronald mcdonald in the ship come here little boy try this big mac happy beer happy beer world record jesus how many kills did you get in that lovely little boy put you on the team illegally wear this uniform you better drink that vanilla cheese located there's people landing on the bunker but they don't realize they reset all the codes oh

12 is tracers look what looks like he's got dragon's breath this is the scorpion isn't it oh look what's here look what i found [Music] it's the cx-9 oh i thought you meant like the scorpion like pistol thing oh no no no no they're not even announced this gun so why is it in the game oh this has got oh my god this has got a rangefinder built into the scope they're on this is sick this is this is insane this sounds amazing when you fire it ready here we go oh yeah oh that is pretty cool all right this is the this is the royal mg this is the one that hasn't come out the other one that hasn't come out yet i can rank it up by doing the flag you run really slow with it real slow with it i'll do a quick reload here we go quick reloads guys wait wait i'm getting it and do the inspect animation there it is it's rubbish for this gun it's terrible but it's fine because i did it a12 for loop oh have you got the jack 12 about what you got yeah i got a jack 12 with dragon's breath that's flawless i'm going to keep this yeah i'm keeping this gun for this round man [Applause] keeping this hey stop have a look at this money tagging buy station what do you want look at this hot water this trace attack doesn't even exist i don't think i want it it doesn't exist though guys we're gonna get hit by the storm pretty hard oh it's blue okay yeah this tracer pack literally doesn't exist interesting illegally now i need plates anybody got plates oh i have one spare anyone else feel like that's a zombie style weapon that they bought like maybe yeah maybe i mean this gun that i've got here you run really slow with it but it's cool it's cool this one's got really high mobility the scorpion yeah it's nice it reminds me very much of the scorpion from bf4 oh the season looks like exactly like that [Applause] yeah you run so much faster jack than than what i do like yeah come here we just start sprinting together all right here we looking much go look at the far edge oh you're so slow what though this is so slide super heavy this time we just dropped off the roof over here on ground moving on the rain someone jumps towards us then illegally illegally i'd imagine so i'm running it with the mac 10 though so at least i can you know keep up lucky apparently that jack 12 you've got there is in the lurch bundle that came out i want the blue one that they brown then took away instantly never saw again yeah i think i bought that that's how i went yeah yeah you literally can't buy it anymore yeah they brought it out and then it's gone it's just completely gone yeah like cod accounts will be more expensive to buy because you've got like super limited edition skins on them i like fortnite but when someone hacks your account well no if because people sell accounts don't they like counter strikes what do you mean if someone was just randomly selling if you were if like let's say i go oh hang on i've got the lurch skin on this position i'm gonna put it on ebay oh yeah you can probably definitely do that i don't know if that's against terms of service maybe it is there's people where loads of people are there yeah they're already getting great loadout maybe two different teams we've not got long guys we do have to get up the hill illegally illegally there's a contract outside the car showroom yeah yeah someone's just uh either died or yeah they've dropped that contraband contract still people on green as well spaghetti okay i need i need a i need a rest on the roof please kill you i have no idea but i down somebody uh i think i got spammed from red room [Music] it sounded like he was literally inside you no he was down below me i think at the very least moving guys yeah coming over yeah there they are never mind i'm just so slow with this gun it took me nine bullets to down somebody with this royal mg though bullets strella games i mean the bullet speed on this what the hell is it really slight no it's fast as hell dude a lot of recoil on the rall i have a lot of recall on the roll what i wonder what the rate of fire is jack it's also really fast it's also a dismemberment round gun so you kill someone with that it's dismemberment rounds that's cool they never really uh put those on ground loop before so it's pretty cool to see is it a blueprint one you've got jack yeah yeah it is yeah i thought so apparently um broken managed to get back online so we can link up with him after jack's jumped off doing resurgence oh right yeah yeah we're excited [Applause] cracked one [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] kill and i'll load our drops

gonna be it for today uh we had a few new members uh quinny thank you thundercloud lima commodore chucky d heretic and dan appreciate you guys thank you so much so it was good fun enjoyed it i like the new zombies area although i think you know i hope they quickly change that and the zombies start spreading across the map because if it's just a ship it might get old pretty quick but i reckon what's going to happen as soon as we see that five percent thing on the machine is that the zombies will spread across the map over the next two weeks and then this event will end in some kind of catastrophic explosion and maybe some kind of new map i don't know we'll have to wait and see but if you enjoyed the stream if you enjoyed the video if you're watching it as a video guys hit that like button right now thank you it's a great way to help support me and also if you buy anything in the store season pass skins whatever it might be use my creator code and i'll get a kickback from that there it is enjoy the rest of your day guys we'll be back tomorrow for more warzone we might do outbreak we'll wait we'll wait to see i might play a bit of outbreak either later today or tomorrow
