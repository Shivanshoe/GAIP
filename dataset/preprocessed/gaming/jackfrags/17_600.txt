okay i've got another one okay we can do it we do them together then should we do them together um i've got executive level so i've got top floor so i've got to try and get to the top floor here the easiest way is probably going outside to be honest you avoid all the people that way yeah let's group up we don't need to rush this johnny um i'm going to come up the stairs here yeah i'm going to call the stairwell yeah i'm coming up the stairwell no there's a big squad a big big squad that's fine well me and hans have gone um right next to me johnny overhead three i'm coming up just keep going up keep going up all we've got to do is open the doors and then we can get the code okay so let's get that if you if you follow me guys just so you know where the rooms are so one of these doors up here doesn't have the blue ribbons on and we can get in that one i think i've passed it actually yeah it's just down here have any of you got a piece of uh a piece of paper handy or a pen yeah i can have okay remember we've only got about 20 minutes to do this as well but it should be a doddle how do i get up to you okay so this one here okay um can you write this down andrew now stand by i'm getting shot over here one sec i'll get a pen and paper i'll be right back no yeah i mean i was thinking you could write down on your phone uh getting inside okay i'm back sorry outside might be easier andrew just find the ropes that come around to the loop right okay [Music] so we've got uav c5 house zero house eight nose nose right okay that's that's that one right now we've gotta go get yours huds so we need to go down a level we keep going around there's a middle staircase andrew if you could just kill everyone yeah oh i'm being hunted are you kidding no the triple threat as well in the room as long as you stay alive heads they're uh in the room we were just in yeah just come pass come here come here we're close we're close when we open it you just get the code and i'll i'll cover the door okay it's not supportive chase new jack got held off for a while they've come up all right just keep going i've got stopping power in my gun so we should shred people if we see him uh here right open that hold on it's there we go okay i'll cover you get the code yeah i'm writing this down so we got one five house zero house nose nose nose one five house zero house nose nose nose i think that's right just double check this one five house zero house nose nose nose okay so now we can work out which numbers are which so a c is a one so the code starts with one and then five and then we don't know how share know zero we don't know house eight is n so it's eight eight eight okay right now we've got to go to the top floor how do you know which order they they go in there uh so it displays the same code three times oh okay but it gives you different symbols and letters okay i think how many numbers are you missing so at the moment i'm only missing the h's but by process of elimination you can brute force it um there's still a lot of combinations though isn't it the two numbers missing not really right there going up i'm just gonna leave him so we'll get right to the top level guys there's people here one down guy coming up the stairs behind us as well can you watch that yeah down behind us okay so the access code is here so you guys can cover this here cover this so we've got one five oh hold on i just need to write this down i've just got to guess i got oh my god i've picked up so much money on that stairwell it's not what you want i'm just going to go through i'm just going to guess that h is uh two so one five zero okay so it's not two just guess it's a three uh one five three zero three eight eight eight okay it's not three let's guess it's four one five four zero four damn it one crumbs five four zero four eight eight eight four so six one five six zero six seven one five seven zero seven eight one five seven zero seven eight eight got it there we go all right you should all get that did you guys all get that you did yeah cool and now there should be fireworks going off at the stadium if you're interested in checking that out well i mean i'm not absolutely uav um so you guys can if you i think we've all got it now now we're in the room so in this room there's a few like little things about the map like some missile launchers a few codes something's going down so if i put that i'll tell you what um if one of you guys can one of you guys put this code in just so i can show the on the video what it looks like so right this i'll just say it when i'm at the stadium all right so two of you come with me like johnny or andrew stay and uh put the code in i'm coding okay we go down here we did that very fast guys i'm impressed good job okay so johnny if you put in the code one five seven zero seven eight eight eight oh yeah around the edge i don't see them you can't quite see it i just need to go outside yeah i think we have to go outside are we gonna have enough time yeah we got enough time we still got about two minutes going back up and then out of the windows zero seven triple a do it now johnny hey girl goes beautiful that's cool man so that code is not it's different every single round every single time it's a different code but basically because we knew what two out of the three symbols were i just brute forced the other number now you know the other the other numbers yeah they were both symbols were they were they both the same symbol yeah the other two numbers were both house and does that mean that house had to be the same number yeah had to be the same number right okay because but if you would have got it so that the two symbols will say house and nose i don't think that can happen because yeah because you'll always know two of the symbols generally yeah you will always know what two of them are as long as you get two ideally you want all three so you can get the whole code but i just went through every single number until i got to seven and that's the correct code we did it boys second was that second round third round um third so that was half an hour that took us that's easy for professional gamers um honestly i thought we were going to be here for about two hours professional easter egg hunters [Laughter] this is what we do is well we that was good fun actually i quite enjoyed that because you're on the clock a bit there's a bit of pressure there is that um is that blueprint any good well it's uh it's for the amax the a max good though cr56 it's okay i mean it's not a meta gun i'm just going to take a look if you go to i don't know if you guys unlocked the air max you should have that blueprint either way enigma mp7 was it it's a galil cr56 amax i haven't actually unlocked the air max in the assault rifle so it's got a gold magazine on it get three gun book kills while using an assault rifle in 10 different matches it's kind of like a marble wood effect like a shiny wood oh uh we're in it ruined it oh i think we've auto cued oh yeah i left the party i did not yeah it's quite a nice looking skin isn't it enigma it's got some details on it too
