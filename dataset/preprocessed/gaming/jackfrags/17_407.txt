what's a really good long-range gun for the engineer ak5c maybe should we go that s raw get the new dice camo on lovely look at that i spawn on that chopper shall we no that's instantly dead that's small and that's that's battlefield 4 that was an awesome intro i just wanted to get on the helicopter but he was being instantly attacked oh god this uh lavs coming in hard are you waiting for the chopper yeah okay no you're not waiting for the job you just destroyed the chopper you destroyed the chopper because you weren't away for the job you're away for the job i think is it a bot maybe it's a bot this game doesn't have bots does it he's looking at me now all right mate listen i'm trying to do a gameplay commentary here and you're just there staring at me does it say anything in the chat well jack francis online can't be him guy always gets him oh someone else got it damn it so i wanted to have some real some true battlefield moments today and this server i think it just runs lti range 24 7. and although you know this isn't a great map for infantry but i wanted the straw now the browser's going to end soon but we'll play the next one it'll be right left i promise but the straw imagine if you had a rocket launcher like this in warzone laser guided god this is that helicopter come on come on come on come on come on i just moved out the way that would have been like the easiest raw kill i've ever done mobility hit god i've run out now if i wanna have wasted it should we go in there anyway this is the round's about to end so it's fine isn't it we'll just get killed by that attack helicopter that's it hey free kill free kill let's go let's go kill me already you're boosting that guy's kill death ratio it's just the kind of player that i am i'll do it for you all right that's the end of the video guys thanks for watching if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the net i'm just kidding it's a joke we're going to play the next round it's fine relax so it turns out it's not outside raised 24 7. that was a lie it did say that though on battle log but it's caspian border that can be quite a fun battlefield map so we'll play this anyway right boots on the ground that's what i know that's what i'm good at is that an f35 it isn't it i want it there as well it's kind of cool how the uavs are just in the game from the commander that is the commander uav isn't it what's this here oh it's the big boy sniper rifle that one hit kills everyone look at this baby i wish i could inspect it look at the jet this is awesome it's like i'm playing a a trailer or something okay right that's a tank so we're not going there i think they're up on the hill here aren't they got friendlies going up here someone on the left yes look at that it's disgusting they shouldn't be allowed but it is it's illegal it's completely legal so one at the top there something just yes hey we've got a service staff for it thank you it's cool how they changed this from a like a green map to an autumn map at the first map all the trees were pretty much the same family of green colors and now it's so pretty and autumnal i believe is the word tower's still standing isn't it now let's go up this way then oh a couple guys here stop shooting my mate it's not cool for a nade there they're right above me here i'm gonna run into

can't stand for this it's my pipe and no one else is allowed in it but me get out the pipe it's my pipe i told you this before this is like fun over here is that a vehicle spitting fire yeah well it was not anymore that's why you don't bring aa vehicles into downtown because that happens it's kind of cool that we have a commander though people still playing commander on bf4 in 2021 insane dare i go back in the pipe i mean i could couldn't i i couldn't i'm just going to look at the pipe i dare to dream about the pipe it looks okay the pipe is safe there's no one around the pipe right now what will wait me on the other side this time i don't know what's it gonna be [Applause] i think we're okay we're good we're good what the hell so their commander is dropping supplies right oh my god someone's repairing that tank that's a pro tanker right there got an engineer on it yes i mean it's just simply too good isn't it so i go downstairs it's down here isn't it there's a big carly whirly staircase oh god oh god the same guy are you kidding me has he not moved the whole time is that where he lives he just lives down there he puts the thugs down he gets the grenade launcher every time and just kills me apparently did i just see a cheeky sneaky engineer right here i think i did didn't i yeah i did oh no the attack kilos after me now i should never done it i'm sorry tacular's dead

much i appreciate you more than you know all right lads what are we doing here are you trying to grenade that are they up there i think that went up didn't it i'd like to go up there myself and see what's happening oh my god they're protecting it that bad it's literally just a tower there may be some gold at the top or something i don't know when i can go hey he didn't wait long enough i think it's clear all right lads oh my god that body i have special powers i mean i i looked at it and it just went flying into the air it's just a casual tank here look at this this poor thing it doesn't have a home anymore someone just left it like this out in the woods why why would you abandon it like that this time kind of family i had friends i had a life to look forward to i can't believe that guy dude he's serious okay good lad thank you he understood the sentiment where should we go guys here raylem real i'm gonna get him get him yes that's it use the power of the tank about helicopter just swooping in that dude's gonna be getting mad kills right now he rests yeah he did look gone bye it's a really good spot for the tank here isn't it put some shells in oh mate i've got aps try it again try it again little timmy let's go well i'm going to try and get behind that tank that's on the other side of the point it's a tank off all right we can do it we can do it that's a real hit now i put my eps as well mate i've got your rear you repping me oh the ship we were having an epic tank battle and the gun ship just steals it unforgivable i see this infantry yes there's one the direct hit from the straw come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on yes there's two [Laughter] see what i mean about guardian rocket launchers they're just cool well the people should just explode i think let's get this b point unlock i snagged that without dying let's go excuse me that was rude killed in action you are killed by sniper dmr limit i've been using the sniper the whole game how does that make sense it didn't kill me before just kill me now why it's been a really fun match though isn't it the end i think we're gonna lose we're winning to begin with but their vehicles have just dominated us really how much you can do about that you need good vehicle players to be honest the vehicles are so appealing this game all that knight three r's core what the hell that jeeps went flying by [Applause] enjoyed that a lot there's another guy down here isn't that oh oh watch out watch out oh just made it didn't quite die at the end there but there we go guys i hope
