it's been 11 days now since they did the big band wave against the cheetahs in call of duty warzone and in that time i've been playing a lot of the game again and i've not came across one single obvious cheetah in any of my matches and i've been playing a lot because it's been super fun now that we can enjoy the game without blatant cheaters but having a blast with the game again even though it's incredibly competitive kind of like it some days and in the match i'm going to show you today i was using an amax build that absolutely slaps it's right here if you want to copy it with that special crosshair you can change that in the customization of the reticle takes a little bit to unlock it but once you get it it's just something about it feels really nice and of course the mac 10 on the side here and this is my build for that if you want to copy that too with that said it's a really nice game of quads with broken machine westy and study and i've only done one edit which was just moving from a to b because i wanted to show you guys an entire match almost the kind of movement that we make the comms that we have so i've left it mostly unedited but it's entertaining all the way through there's always fights going on it's a really high kill game so i think you'll have fun watching this one also i have just changed up a couple settings on my mouse for the past like 15-16 years i've been using 400 dpi but a couple days ago a content creator called battle nonsense who has done loads of brilliant work for the fps community and testing netcode and pushing developers to be better at that kind of stuff he made a video on mouse dpi and hertz for the mouse long story short if you have a higher hurts on your mouse and a higher dpi you're giving the computer more information to work with and you're going to get measurably lower input lag and the difference from 400 dpi to 1600 dpi was quite big so that's what i've gone to them i'll put 1600 dpi now and i've reduced my in-game sends to make sure i've got the same sensitivity just with a higher dpi and this was one of my first matches using that and it went awesome i felt like the mouse was really connected with the game i felt like my aim was on just a good time all round really and i think i'll do a more detailed look at that in the future when i talk about setup and all that good stuff but you should go check out battleground since it's a bit on that if you want to see the evidence because he created this whole machine thing and did a load of accurate testing for it so basically high dpi less input lag that's what i'm going for now as always thank you to all these lovely ladies and gents for using my cod supported credit code in the store i appreciate you guys keep the screenshots coming thank you and if you like this video leave a like that's a great way to help support me and help the video on the channel grow so here we go then some maximum sweat with the amax and mac 10 enjoy what is that
