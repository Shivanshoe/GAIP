hi guys and welcome back to bf2042 i've played it for about a week and a half or so and just wanted to hop back on and see what's going on there is a featured mode at the moment which is like a gun roulette but i'm not particularly interested in that because it's just tdm and i've just queued up and it's put me on orbital i thought okay well you know what i haven't really played it that much since the beta you're going to go by by boris staying there so we'll play it and see what it's like and i'm using the vector here oh that was close i thought i was dead then i've got c5 as well just in case i need to blow up tanks and stuff because i just think that it's like the m5 the rocket launcher is decent but because the travel time is so slow on it it's just a bit hard sometimes isn't it to hit things you drop me some meds maria maria what are you doing she calling in the vehicle can i call in the vehicle i barely ever use that menu i like never use that menu i think that's the first time i've used it in ages hang on oh no that thing is going to destroy everyone on this point i've kind of snuck up behind him here i don't think there'll be another one on the top there see that was weird because i got the kill hit marker but it just gave me the assist so what was it that's a body what jimmy and jackie oh no oh here i'm so sorry for a story i'm sorry that helicopter's still alive oh my god is it coming back where is it there's one person on the point where above me three people no were they on the roof the whole time oh my god maybe they were and that's clean up on all five no one more where'd you go prone oh i knew it i knew it would kill me god damn it somebody please get a stinger and destroy it well those fingers don't really work oh thank you for the rest i'm gonna die again to it though get in quick it's fine nope dead it's so strong i'm not going back to that point but there is another there's a little bird there i wish i could grapple it and just like put c5 on it that'd be sick what are you firing at all right let's go c1 then it was just one person here on the minimap that's an enemy isn't it 40 degrees i think there's an enemy there there's something because if you find a rocket ow who's doing that there is someone there look just keep wanding through the bushes eventually the red dot will come up they were here right now they're gone yeah i think they're gone hovercrafter what are you doing maybe i should have gotten that i need a vehicle anyway oh whoa oh my god i thought it was on the ground i could see it on the mini-map you're kidding that's ridiculous all right we're going to be oh we're inside cool oh close did you guys know this by the way that side over there from here you're like oh damn i've got to go up to the roof or maybe like [Music] sorry i've got to go up to the roof or maybe like drop down and then go with the repel no you can just walk across look there's a pathway here goes all the way around oh last bullet okay yeah i only discovered this like a few weeks back i was like you can just walk around it okay enemies up here on the minimap a lot of enemies actually put that armor away i've got the suppressor on here that actually keeps me off the mini-map it should be good oh oh my god he's literally stood behind the turret wow what if the revive meow bad cat revive me come on you can do it come on no angel why are you the way you are i'm gonna go back there oh on the roof okay hey i think that guy knew i was coming but couldn't really do anything about it are we clear i think we're clear yeah i'm just going to jump off whee look at that bolty down there gotta get some c5 on it i wonder oh he's just like he's just bailed out of it hey and put a turret down that's how it's going to kill me isn't it i'm going to kill the turret and then i'm going to come here and then i'm going to go rap rap rap um thank you for the medkit is that revenge was that the same guy oh hello i don't know maybe i shouldn't have wasted that i'm gonna steal this you're kidding literally as soon as i was about to get in it over to d this is an invisible wall there or something what the hell boris running towards enemies boris come back okay there's lots of enemies over there this is good love this yes even if you've got armor i can't beat the vector i can hear loads underneath me one more here where'd you go oh oh can't beat the pkp though let's do ip this helicopter here i use it as a spawn yikes anyone up there oh i didn't think i was going to make that i knew it i knew there'd be one there's always one what the explosions what is this one underneath forester right here does that mean they're on this level yeah you were there little corridor i don't think i've ever been in this nice little sniper platform though isn't it this oh my god no whoa i can't i can't put my shoe hello what the what's that man doing there sir interesting spot oh that wild cat over there oh man 200 meters i'll try maybe i can parachute behind it and get it that would be a lot easier if i was playing the sundance because then you can just swoop in really quick let's try i'm gonna try it i wouldn't be good if you could like send c5 at the top of these okay i don't think they've spotted me yet helicopter there no one up here never mind jimmy and jackie again how am i going to approach this i do have enough to kill them jump off okay if they stay there maybe they're distracted by a helicopter come back that's it come this way come this way someone literally just started shooting at it the second of night landed on the ground it's gone mad no this is terrible anyway i'm not gonna get that kill hello dice hop over here good it's my goal to kill that wildcat can we do it though i don't know ammo they're gonna be on the roof aren't they on that one good there is one on the roof though oh shot in the back ah couldn't get around the corner killed by a penguin with an m16 that's embarrassing i think we're going to end up winning this phone which is good no balti what are you doing ow what what excu where where was i being shot from then was it above me i know we did get the victory gg how do we do 28
