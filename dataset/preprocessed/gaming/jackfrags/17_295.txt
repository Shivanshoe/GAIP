call of duty warzone changed forever today there was a huge patch that's just gone out with the mid season 4 reloaded update there's a ton of bug fixes in here the patch notes are absolutely massive i'm not going to go through all of them i'm just going to talk about the most exciting ones and then we're going to jump into a game that we played earlier today so the biggest deal here is an increase across the board of the time to kill so this means that on average almost all of the guns in the game will now take longer to kill than they did before raven said they're doing this to try and increase the gun skill in the game so rather than any gun being able to just beam you almost instantly you'll now have to rely much more on your aim your recoil control your movement going for headshots that kind of thing i'm all for this i think it's a good direction for the game and they said that they're going to make more adjustments in the future we played about five or six games earlier today and you can definitely notice the difference especially at those medium and longer ranges so if you play today and you find yourself wondering okay well it feels a bit different that's why there's a new weapon that's been added as well that's called the ots 9 and it's an smg really good firepower up close with good visibility but it's got a smaller magazine size i think the max size you can have is 40. it does have a quick reload though and i think the times kills about 500 millisecond average so it's really good up close but maybe only good for one or two kills so probably a really good choice for taking on one of ones and maybe in solos or duos but in quads you might suffer a bit because of that low magazine count you can unlock it normally by killing two or more players rapidly in 15 different matches i haven't done that yet i just bought a blueprint there's a brand new one in the store if you guys pick any blueprints up today or battle pass you can now gift the battle pass as well do consider using my code jack frags in capital letters and i'll get a bit of kickback from that as always thanks to all these people on the screen now who've done the same thing and tweeted me a picture the cx-9 as well was also in a little presentation that treyarch did last night they were talking about the new zombies map but they also had a bit at the end about war zone and you see the cx-9 in it that was in the game at one point very briefly in supply crates i think it was only like two weeks it was in the game they took it away hasn't come back since but that is a modern warfare weapon so perhaps we'll get that soon and maybe that rail lmg as well that appeared but that's not in just yet a few of the things that we noticed too you can now repel much sooner after your friend you see here at superstore this is me going right after study went up and it just means that you can get on those elevated positions together as a squad quicker than you could before they've changed the swiss scope as well now looks like this much similar to the kind of scopes you get on the hdr or the car 98 i think it looks closest to the cross thread or cover shot it's one of those two very similar to that there's a sentry gun as well all the matches i played this morning i didn't find it myself but lachlan did tactical brit you can put it down and it will just automatically shoot at targets for you seems pretty strong but it's not that tanky so i don't think this is going to be like a big meta thing or anything but it can lead to some cool gameplay situations and finally before we jump into the gameplay i don't know if this is a bug or just an unintended thing but when you get in trucks now zombie hands pop up out of the ground behind you feel like that's a bug or maybe they've added accidentally for a halloween thing in the future i don't know it looks kind of cool though i like it and there's also an option for planes in the controls so it looks like planes are coming to war zones soon whether that's cold war or whether it's the rumored world war two stuff that's coming up we'll have to wait and see but planes in warzone could be quite a big deal but i think they definitely have to increase the flight ceiling if they did put them in because the helicopter flight ceiling is just way too low for planes in my opinion so today using the new smg the ots 9 and i'm pairing it with the m13 which did get a little bit of a buff so you're gonna see the m13 used a lot more now because it's low recoil high headshot damage easy to control and it does get that 60 round mag as well so pretty good choice right now it's day one though the met is still forming we'll see what's good what's bad i think you're going to see a lot more modern warfare weapons back in line now so exciting times ahead and this ttk update will really change the game forever it's going to be a bit different now with that said guys i hope you enjoyed this game playing with star tactical brit and westy if you do like it guys leave a like thank you and a comment down below great way to help support me subscribe for more let's get it oh they are driving
