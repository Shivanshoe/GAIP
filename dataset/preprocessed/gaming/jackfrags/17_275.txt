m16 rds4 grip heavy barrel that's about right hi guys and welcome to some bf3 live gameplay commentary today we are playing on no-show canals this is one of the maps that's going to be remade for battlefield portal in bf2042 and it is going to look absolutely insane in that game and hopefully there's no suppression because that is really really bad now this map we used to play all the time for warm-up whether that was like before a recording session or before a competitive match or if you just wanted some team deathmatch wanted to get your aim on get that m16 out and just buzz people man oh it's still so satisfying to use now obviously there is a big version of this map for conquest but i'm recording this on sunday morning and i couldn't find any conquest servers it was just people playing tdm which is what i expected oh my god it's a little rat's nest down here get that glock 18 out awesome let's go nice yes i'd say that this map is most famous for the uh tdm version of course but the conquest version of it is quite fun too there's some really interesting areas like under the bridges and everything and you can use the boats it was always good for helicopters as well it had a little bird on and a transport really funny squads [Applause] we didn't um see any of it ah got beamed by the farm ass yeah i was saying that we didn't really see any of this map in the portal trailer there was one screenshot where they're in the boat by the carrier that was it really oh it's just like riding a bike with this gun we get stuck in the middle here get off that head glitch rest for you mate not mama a gunplay in this game something else apart from the suppression really really doesn't like that i didn't shoot that did i too late now i've committed ow oh dude get absolutely shreked by the g8 yes and just stay here okay maybe i should just not do that anymore there's a guy right here got a shot of me fair play yeah magnum it's friendly what about tap firing this game got attacked i mean they nerfed it a little bit but still i think it is the most effective way to shoot in this game or you can just follow m16 goes up and to the right so really straightforward to control it that was close definitely outstayed my welcome there sniped in the back this video isn't just about the m16 no no no we're gonna be on the shotguns as well 870 with the bug shot it's getting the mix in the middle here this gun is so overpowered in this game and i am the number one assault medic right here oh my god that it how did i dodge that look at this oh my god get rekt oh i love those sound effects some iconic voice lines in this game bang look still can't get over how bright the sun is in this in this game double kill with the nade beautiful love that [Music] oh hi yes yes i'm in trouble now oh you did nice little dance though you did there when you died i love that there's only a 32 player server as well was it 48 it might be 48 but i mean it's chaos i'm gonna take a little break here chill out for a bit is that grenade gonna kill me yeah right and one of the weirdest things coming back to these old battlefield games and stuff like this look at that that box there looks like you could totally just vault that and get into the blue container but none of this stuff you can jump onto bit of a flank here oh give me a little tickle there oh nothing i could do no it's not just shotguns either guys we're doing the full quote today we're going to be sniping you can snipe on this map and if you do you want to be up there with the rest of your kin i think this little mattress pin spot some enemies there was a time in bf3 if you didn't play it where you could put this thing down the mouth oh my god it controls awful by today's standards but you could put it down on the floor and you could get your teammates on it and use it as an elevator you smell a knife kill coming up here boys yes give me those tags oh the enemy's got it now there's one oh the body just fell off there's two and there's another body i got a spawn beacon up there there's three single-handedly hey there's four wiping out all of the enemy team runs over that crane smoke oh my god did you see that the glass is floating in the air there nice little bug that was on this top bit here that's a badness it's better oh my god that rag doll ow what the on the bridge i'm just still chilling here behind this stack of crates oh let's go didn't get the follow-up i mean if they're not going to move i'm going to push them what are they doing here oh god one more yes did the call of duty on him [Applause] please dice come on i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i've become a shark there's a dude here i'm just gonna let him reload and then we'll push up hey give me your old tags jt has got to be my favorite pistol oh this m40 oh come on come on out of nowhere get back on the crane again look at that guy even saw me and that one didn't move oh spawn protection and again will that even reach oh i need a little shout oh lovely drag shot there this guy's still on the bridge that's revenge melon exploded get in the river swimming with the fishes g18 is just superior in everywhere apart from the magnum maybe two minutes way too ready there right we're gonna finish up with support lmg m249 that looks good whatever it's not long left in the round see if we can heavy weapons guys some people gonna get that line up and hear the music it's like a weird wobbling effect isn't it i'm sorry so going here yes there is beam oh no what the hell dice taking shaky cam to the max there but
