i thought that i would absolutely go for this one now usually this would end up with me becoming a pancake on the ground but i went for it right through the hole we made it and this was my first game on the new warzone patch has been a big update to the game today and it's actually a really good patch in my opinion and while there isn't really that much new content on the map apart from the underground tram teleportation system thing there's a ton of great bug fixes and balance changes some which will actually shake the game in the meta up quite a lot they've added a new smg improvements to audio so you can hear footsteps better some new user interface features it just appears to be a really good quality of life update for warzone i'm going to take a look at everything new today so this is the transit system that's a gulag token so if you've been in the gulag you respawn and you find one of those if the goo lag is still open and you'll die you'll get another chance at going in the gulag so that's the map of the transit system right there and all around the map there are these bunkers you go down there are four doors and i believe that in each of them you can take two of them and it will say in front of the door where it goes to you go through the door there's a little cut scene animation i'll show you what that looks like in a little bit and then you will teleport to that location on the map so it's very similar to how we had the trains the underground system in pedansk but now it's much quicker it's not a big elaborate area anymore and i do foresee that these will be used more than the train system was just because they're a lot quicker although it is super easy to count these locations of course as you saw there enemy player came through little black smoke particle effect and that's just a really easy kill but if that's a squad i'm playing solos here maybe that won't be as easy for me the only thing that i can see that will kind of put people off these are the fact that it's always a ladder to get out the ones that i've been in anyway it's just one ladder to get out so really easy to camp at the top i could deter individuals especially in solos maybe not so much in squads because you've got a backup but could deter people from using them prime example here a little fight going on at the top and this is a bigger bunker area so maybe these guys were just looting early game but i'd be dead if someone was just looking at me as i came about that ladder so that's the new transit system pretty self-explanatory and you'll learn the routes as you play the map a bit more new gulag weapon rotation i haven't had a bad weapon yet and thank god that that top brake revolver is not there anymore and this is the new smg the cargo stuff i have to be honest i didn't realize i didn't remember that they were adding a new smg in this patch but this is obviously a version that i picked up from ground loot and i got a little fight here with snoop dogg and i didn't realize or i didn't look at the hood that build of it is a burst smg i think that's how it is by default snoopy eating himself off there and i thought that i would give him a quick round of applause for that one they did increase the down speed and i'll talk about that a bit later but the time to kill here with the burst [Music] not bad i've not unlocked it yet but if you tap you can get the burst off pretty quick i think people will just gravitate to the fully auto builds though this is the blueprint i need to figure out if it's actually worth unlocking and getting all the upgrades for it i just don't know yet if it's going to be a viable choice in the game but you can unlock it in modern warfare and it's three sliding kills in a match 15 times so best way to do it load up modern warfare hopefully there's a shipment playlist on there hardcore do three slide kills quit the game load into another one and you'll get it pretty quick that way maybe 20 25 minutes if you're efficient there's a new perk in the game it's a perk from vanguard called serpentine and it's essentially 20 less damage when you're sprinting it goes in the first perk slot on paper you might think well that seems like a surefire pick but honestly i don't see that many people using it i personally wouldn't pick that over quick fix i don't think it's gonna have that big an impact on the meta maybe a little bit on caldera but on rebirth now i messed this up though this is one of the only bad things with the patch when you do the free look it just has crazy sensitivity i don't know if it's like that on console but on pc something's gone wrong there you may notice as well in the normal battle royale modes the starting player count has been reduced by 30 to 120 so this is just in the standard battle royale modes i think that one's 50 50 if it sticks but their reasons for it were that they want more people to be playing the game more than just spectating so a couple of things they've done to make sure that you get back in the game the gulag entry token which we've already looked at there's also a redeploy token which if you pick it up and you die you'll automatically redeploy you won't go to gulag the cost of buying a teammate back has been reduced to 3 000 from 4 000 so cheaper to respawn your buddies the death tax has been adjusted as well so instead of losing 80 of your money when you die if you come back you'll now return with 50 of what you had and you can also find loadout drops as a rare ground loop pickup so i guess that the thinking from raven is that with all those regain mechanics you might not notice that lower player count as much i'm assuming that that will also have benefits to frames per second on your client and also server performance but i don't know that for sure you may have noticed me there pick up the speed boost token as well those are now in the normal pr game modes they've been in ltms in the past just gives you a cheeky little speed boost and you can slide real quick hdr's had a little nerf although i was using it today and still making some nice effective shots with it they've just increased the bullet drop a bit so you'll have to lead a little bit more at those extreme ranges in the patch notes there's also a ton of changes to so many guns in the game various buffs and nerfs this is a massive balance pass across the board for primary weapons in terms of meta weapons on first impression i think the bar is going to make a bit of a comeback the stg is still really strong because i don't think that they touched it the vault got a little damage buff that's going to be a great close-range sniper support weapon vargo's strong cooper carbine's still good amax got a bit of a nerf which i'm really sad about it's my favorite gun but there you go we'll see how the meta shifts and changes over the next few days and weeks they've nerfed stims a bit as well so i don't think we're going to see them as often but you may see more snapshot grenades now if you're on xbox series s or x i've got some really good news for you if you've got a 120 hertz tv or display you can now once again use that that support was added in the past but then microsoft changed something with their gdk 120 hertz stopped working their software package changed and it took a bit of working out i think it's been like over a year or something now but finally with this patch you can use 120 hertz again on those systems if you have a 120 hertz display i definitely recommend using that setting the game is just smoother and feels a lot more responsive there's less input lag well worth it this here is a new field upgrade for warzone the radar jammer it's been in many multiplayer games of cod before of course and it just scrambles the mini map of enemy players and it will prevent killstreaks for anyone within a short radius of where you put it down you can see on the minimap there that blue circle and now we're in squads i can show you some of the user interface upgrades if you look at the bottom left here right after we listen to the most english person i've ever heard in call of duty no i landed upstairs by myself i hope he has a great day obvious differences here first things first you've got a total of how much money this squad has at the top so you don't have to do any quick maths anymore work out if you can afford a loadout or embarrass yourself if you get the calculation wrong which i usually do but what's super cool is that you can see how many plates your teammates have so if someone's running low you can quickly look over and see maybe drop them some plates and you can't lie anymore when you say you don't have plates but you actually do great for team play and you can see icons for the gas mask tokens self revives and which kill streaks your squad mates have and that's a brilliant quality of life feature i just wish now that they will actually add a way to see what perks you have whether you could just press a button to bring that up or you go to the scoreboard and it just quickly shows you the icons on the side there now that there's lootable perks in the game too that would be a good feature to add rebirth has been updated to have the same hp as caldera so now it's 150 base health that means higher time to kill on rebirth brings it in line with the main vr modes the knock down speed as i mentioned at the start of the video has been increased so when you get knocked you can now move around a little faster that'll give you more of a chance to escape a follow-up sniper shot or something like that hopefully get yourself a res or get a teammate to come over and save your butt before you finished footstep audio they say that's been improved i need to play some more to really get a feel for that but i will follow up i'll probably do some solo live gameplay commentary videos where i'm really analyzing that and seeing if it actually has improved and that's everything really in terms of the highlights from me i know there was a lot to cover there and there's so much more stuff in the patch notes bug fixes like when you slide and the camera would lock they say they fixed that now which is great it's just a really good patch overall in my opinion the balance of the game seems pretty good now the changes to the guns i like that there's more ways to get back into the game didn't really come across any bugs so looking good i mean it gets a thumbs up from me this one on first impression so that's all guys thank you for watching leave a like if you enjoyed the video code jackfrags in the cod store if you buy anything all in caps of course drop me a comment below i'll see you next time bye
