on this channel in 2019 I uploaded a video to YouTube every single day this was a bit of a personal challenge for me to see if I could do it but also so I could make this video that you're watching right now a breakdown of it all we'll be looking at what happened to my channel over the course of the year and diving into the analytics which videos performed best which performed worse and what were the outcomes and consequences of daily uploads perhaps this will help me to understand what works for my audience and what doesn't but also reveal some secrets and trends in the mysterious and often feared YouTube algorithm maybe it could help you in some way so the initial question you may ask is why did you want to upload daily couple of reasons firstly for me personally could I do it could I keep it up challenge myself daily to post something interesting and engaging for my viewers and second there is the theory that daily uploads on YouTube are favorable for the aforementioned algorithm the idea that if you're regularly uploading YouTube will promote your videos more in subscriber feeds recommended and trending so let's look at what happened then all of this data comes directly from YouTube studio and as far as I know all channels have access to this feature starting off with a simple overview of how things went in 2019 my channel icky two hundred and eleven million four hundred and sixty seven thousand two hundred and eighty-three views in total that means an average of five hundred and seventy nine thousand three hundred and sixty-two views per day and it equates to nineteen point six million hours of watch time that's about two thousand two hundred and thirty six years now watch time is a very important statistic on YouTube and while I don't claim to understand exactly how the holy algorithm works I don't think anyone knows how it does it's obvious that the more watch time you have the more your video will be promoted and therefore achieve higher views and if it's ad friendly generate more revenue my average view duration for 2019 was five minutes and 33 seconds that's how long I can typically hold your attention for I'm happy with this and being honest I don't really know if this is a good or bad figure compared to my peers but I would like this number to be bigger seeing as most of my upload between 10 to 12 minutes in length so 8 to 10 minutes average view duration is what I'd be aiming for in 2020 in terms of subscribers in 2019 I gained 420 1791 thanks for hitting that sub button I appreciate you and love you lots on the flip side I lost one hundred and sixty two thousand three hundred and eighty subscribers and that's people legitimately pressing unsubscribe and YouTube deleting old accounts I'm sad to see you go maybe I can make it up to you in the future interestingly the average view duration for people who are subscribed is six minutes and 30 seconds but for those who aren't and they have found my video in recommended or in search it's only four minutes and 55 seconds so people who tuned in regularly and know your style of content are much more likely to watch for longer in 2019 I have 2.2 billion impressions now an impression is how many times my video thumbnails were shown to viewers on YouTube and a nice stat to pair with this his click-through rate mine was 6% click-through rate measures how often he was watched a video after seeing an impression this is very important because your thumbnails and video titles are all you have to advertise your channel to an audience who don't know or care that you exist yet so that list on the side there or on the home page you are competing with all of those and out of that your video needs to be the most attractive according to YouTube half of all channels and videos on YouTube have an impression CTR that can range between 2% and 10% so I think I'm doing ok with 6 percent these are my average viewer ages 4 20 19 18 to 24 is at the top at 39.2% followed closely by 25 to 34 at 36.1% this is no surprise to me as my channel is aimed at a more mature audience focused around first-person shooters and tactical games and I'm very happy with this it's what I enjoy playing and creating for the most however I am definitely missing out a lot on the 13 to 17 category there are a lot of young people that use YouTube but ultimately I feel like I would have to change my content and durably to grow in that bracket and I'm not prepared to do that because it would compromise the enjoyment of my biggest audience members too much as for gender ninety seven point three percent of my audience is male 2.7 percent female and on average men watch my videos for forty-five seconds longer than women do my top ten countries were as follows United States UK Germany Canada Australia Netherlands Sweden India France and Poland the United States dominates my audience with thirty six point six percent and accounted for over seventy seven million views in 2019 before we move on to which individual video is performed the best for me I wanted to show you a couple of extra stats as I think they are quite revealing about the nature of how content is discovered on YouTube analytics will now show you how many of your subscribers have turned on all notifications for your channel otherwise known as hitting the bell but then it also shows you out of that number how many actually enabled YouTube notifications on their device for me three hundred and six point nine thousand of you of ding Bell and one hundred and sixty eight point two thousand have done that and enabled the notification to actually see it according to YouTube here ten to thirty percent is average for the first stat and five to twenty percent is average for the second so for me a ten point one percent and five point five percent of my total subscriber base of three million I am within average but I'm right at the lower end of it this is no surprise to me as a row make a big deal of asking viewers to smash that bell at the start of my videos I do say it at the end of my videos occasionally but by that time half of you on average have stopped watching yes of course I would love more of my subscribers to see my videos on their devices when I published them rather than relying on the goodwill of the algorithm so I could mention this more often at the start of my videos but ultimately I feel like it interferes with whatever the content is and it can be jarring and I just feel that lots of people find it annoying if a creator is asking at the start of every video on top of this I don't feel like this is as important as just creating compelling content so people come and look for your stuff rather than being no defied of it and also the next thing I'll show you has a big influence on me check this out when I look at my stats it tells me that YouTube is pushing homepage recommended trending and search really really hard fifty nine point three percent of my total views in 2019 came from viewers who were not subscribed to me that's one hundred and twenty five million four hundred and twenty three thousand three hundred and seventy three of my views last year it's the majority and that tells me that whilst growing a strong subscriber base who always want to see your style of content and personality is still a very important part of the puzzle and you definitely need that foundation there getting your videos and channel to be favorable with the algorithm so you were seen regularly on recommended home page search and up next is equally important for views and growth if not more so how do you do this how do you grow and become algorithm favorable how do you get your videos to be seen from my experience eight years on YouTube full time under stats the two most important factors here are click-through rate and watch time you get good click-through rate by having a strong chrome nail and title as I said earlier that's all you have to separate yourself in this sea of content and you get good watch time by producing quality videos that keep your audience engaged all the way the start of your video is the most important element of this what is the hook why should someone keep watching why do you deserve to hold their attention and we will look into this further when I look at some of my best performing videos next you may be wondering why is watch time so important though well it simply comes down to money and adverbs if you've got along the video you can put more adverts in it there for you and YouTube can make more money YouTube are a company they want to make as much money as possible so therefore they will promote videos that have longer watch time because they can insert more adverts into them more watch time people staying for longer on the platform and more retention that's my understanding of it so back to my videos 26 of them last year achieved over 1 million views and I consider this a great result for my channel and I'm happy with that out of those 26 videos 11 of them were relay to Battlefield seven were related to call of duty modern warfare four of them related to apex legends one of them to gel I fall in order one of them to see of thieves one to hunter showdown and one of them to crossfire my top five were apex legends pro tips and secrets with five point four million views did I fall in order is not what you think with four point five million views most satisfying long-range sniping in battlefield ASMR with three point five million views rare and beautiful battlefield want animations with three point 1 million views and battlefield 5 banned for using this with 2.6 million views I won't go into these specific stats of each video here but I will guess as to why these particular videos performed best for me interestingly I think they're all quite different styles of video 2 so epic legends pro tips my most popular video of the year why did this do well I think it's a case of title timing and content this video was made four days after the game released and with how quickly apex exploded people were searching a lot on YouTube for tips and tricks on how to improve their gameplay when a new game drops and it's one is popular and complex as apex everyone wants to know the secrets the stuff that the game doesn't tell you and all this video was is that actually useful tips plus relevant content on screen and simple explanation Jedi fallen order is not what you think it is new gameplay this was my second most popular video of 2019 and it's a combination of an intriguing title and new gameplay plus information that I think made this a success the title is a challenge to the viewer what do you mean it's not what I think it is how do you know what I think it is anyway and timing played an important role in this too from my perspective a month before this game launched there was still a lot of question marks about what type of game it was based on what was shown at EA play I feel the lots of people thought it was quite a generic hack-and-slash but in reality it was much more open world with a good story and a pinch of uncharted and God of War and I got into that in the video and the title definitely helped to stir that intrigue in people the footage here was new gameplay it was at the time plus as much concise information about the game in ten minutes also you can never write Star Wars off the audience is massive and putting a lightsaber under fallen a TST in the thumbnail takes a couple of those fun boxes most satisfying long-range sniping in battlefield ASMR this was quite simple some nice long-range sniper shots in battlefield 5 no commentary with occasional text to set the scene and provide context and reaction this video took me longer to produce as I only wanted to include my best shots and killstreaks in there so in reality 10 minutes of video here took me an entire week to create it's chilled out and there's a massive audience on YouTube for no commentary gameplay and it's fun to watch the title insinuates that it is and opening with a few strong clips keeps people watching to see what the next clip is rare and beautiful battlefield want animations although this was my fourth most popular video in 2019 I actually released it in august 2018 and from August 2018 to December 2018 it had already accrued 3 million views now it's on around 6 million so this video is what some people in the industry might call evergreen content and it's been recommended heavily and boosted by the YouTube algorithm because of its strong watch time and click-through rate I spent a lot of time on the thumbnail to make it look interesting and oh I've never seen that before and it's a video that will always be watchable and relevant to some extent - it's not news or a flash in the pan rather interesting details and animations that you may not see or notice in a video game I also recorded and presented this video in 4k so the graphics look very nice - and some people just like to see nice graphics finally the fifth most popular video for me of 2019 was battlefield 5 banned for using this the title and thumbnail are intriguing what is this why does the game look like that in the thumbnail and will I be banned if I use it this video looked at a problem with battlefield 5 and a software called Nvidia inspector this is a program that you could use to adjust the detail of the game to make it look incredibly simplistic and improve your visibility significantly it wasn't labeled as a cheat either but some people said they were banned for using it and thankfully eventually it was patched fixed I think it's just a good title and thumbnail and the topic itself is quite interesting there's a bit of a gray area is it cheating is it not and that always opens up a good discussion in the comments which leads to more interactions and YouTube likes interactions on videos the more interactions you get YouTube will think that's a good video and is more likely to promote it so if you can get people talking in the comments that's always good so what was my worst performing video what got the least views well it might surprise you to know that it's an apex Legends video taking the top spot and as it seems the bottom this one was titled chunga's challenge apex legend season one and I released this in March when season 1 of apex legends have just gone live and it scored eighty one thousand two hundred and seventy three views I would say for my channel average that's low and I could just say maybe it was a slow day for YouTube and something broke and it didn't send out the notification enough but I would prefer to look at the data and maybe take a guess at it that way instead the average watch time on this video is actually not bad it's above my channel average at five minutes and 58 seconds the sentiment in the comments and the likes to dislike ratio was good too although there weren't many comments in total it's a video that I was very happy with and I spent a lot of time on I added music and stylistic editing a challenge I set myself to see how many opponents I could complete a finisher on with the character Gibraltar why did it get my lowest views of the Year then well I can take a few guesses the click-through rate on this video was lower than usual only 2.3 percent and maybe that's because the style of the thumbnail that I went for was quite different to my usual style more colorful and I used a different font I just wanted to try something different here obviously it didn't work in terms of SEO perhaps not many people were searching for the word chunga's and it's not really related that much to Apex to I could have definitely come up with a better title and I could learn a few lessons from all of this at the end of the day maybe it was just a bad video or a concept that people didn't find interesting moving on some other tidbits that I thought you might like to see D monetization or limited ads the dreaded yellow symbol well any of my gaming videos D monetized in 2019 well I feel like a play by the rules I'm a date in 2018 as well to cut swearing out of my videos completely so there's none of that and video gaming content as per YouTube's own guidelines is classed differently to real-life violence so we should be good let's see none zero I had no yellow symbols in 2019 all of my videos were deemed ad friendly I attribute this to a couple of reasons I think primarily not having any swearing in them and being very careful about what words are in the title the description and in the first thirty seconds of the video if you don't want the yellow symbol you have to think hard about any word that you use either spoken or typed and how they could be construed or interpreted in a non advertiser friendly fashion and remember that that first initial flag is probably going to come from a bot a robot that's analyzing everything that said in your video and BOTS don't have context so you need to think about that too and not getting the yellow symbol isn't just about making money - if you get it YouTube is less likely to promote your video as it won't make them as much money on ads therefore the algorithm may look at that and go you know what I'm not going to send that video out to more subscribers or put it in recommended or trending because this other video that I've got here is way more profitable and unfriendly so you know what I'm just gonna leave yours there and promote this other one instead good bye Felisha what about copyright then or Content ID did I get any of that business well a little and this can have an effect on revenue and your video being seen the first video was this one the battlefield 5 firestorm trailer breakdown it was the music in the trailer that was flagged in my opinion it shouldn't have been as this was a piece of transformative content its commentary and critique on the new gameplay trailer but because of how YouTube's copyright system works music studios have a lot of power and often I've appealed these kinds of things but they are rejected the whole system needs changing and to evolve with the times because it's easily taken advantage of and it does not favor legitimate creators at all my only other copyright problem in 2019 was with my Jedi fallen order walkthrough in part five and six some quite familiar Star Wars music which of course gets flight automatically as Content ID copyrighted music I did appeal both in this case and I had some help when I appealed them part six turned out okay but part five was not and the claim wasn't released until a later date and by that point it was too late in that video and me a total of four dollars and 43 cents for one hundred and eighty eight thousand views so that's it for the numbers but I wanted to talk about how I personally felt with the plodding daily to YouTube in 2019 how it affected me my mental health life in general etc I will be honest and frank with you and none of what I'm about to say is a complaint I did this all of my own volition it was very difficult at times to keep up with the daily schedule I always tried to keep the quality as high as I possibly could within the given time frames and throughout the whole year I never uploaded and published a video that I wasn't happy with I didn't have much of a social life last year it was just pretty much work the whole time and the major difficulties I faced were when I traveled and was away from home for events or on small breaks luckily YouTube has the ability to schedule uploads so if I was traveling to the US for a few days for a capture event III Gamescom events in London whatever it was I would have to produce more videos to cover every single day that I was away that meant working way more before I left and often stressing and not sleeping as many hours the most challenging period though was during November I was lucky enough to be able to spend three weeks in the United States on holiday but this meant that I had to make up 21 days worth of content but my audience wouldn't have known if I hadn't said anything because everything was business as usual there was a video a day so before I left I produced 14 extra videos and my plan was to make more when I was out there in my downtime my holiday also fell within the release of Jedi fall in order which was a game that I had promised my viewers I would do a walk-through off I didn't get an early copy of the game though unfortunately so I couldn't record that walkthrough before I left home but if I wanted people to see it and get good viewer numbers on it realistically I had to start the walkthrough when the game released while I was on holiday on day one so I went ahead and bought an Xbox at Best Buy downloaded the game and put together a haphazard setup in the place I was staying to record and edit my water of that game in the evenings and early mornings again this isn't a complaint I'm not looking for sympathy I really enjoyed the game it was just the reality of completing this challenge because I've got to November and I wasn't going to give up so what takeaways have I learnt from this I'll try and keep it brief daily gaming video content definitely helped my channel grow in 2019 it challenged me to create something every day and I've enjoyed many aspects of it it also allowed me to introduce more variety and I'm extremely happy with the audience I have now and I'm very grateful that you tuned it daily video is meant that my audience were actively looking for and expecting a new video every day to more importantly I don't feel like I'm pigeon holed into making videos on one specific game or franchise and honestly that's a nice feeling being able to keep myself engaged and interested with new gaming experiences rather than just the same thing again in a game this gives me more creative freedom and to introduce new video ideas and themes I also learned that more than anything your title thumbnail and watch time are the most important things the title and thumbnail must create intrigue and inspire people introduce an air of mystery perhaps but the content and quality of the video after they click is equally as important don't clickbait people and fail to deliver on the promise of the title and thumbnail instead think of it like this if you can keep people watching interested and engaged your videos will be more enjoyable for your viewers they'll be seen more unpromoted by YouTube whether that's by educating offering a new perspective tips tricks commentary making someone laugh cry stirring any emotion whatever it may be think about how you feel when watching other people's videos which ones do you click on which ones do you watch all the way through and why which ones do you just stop after two minutes because you get bored so structure of the video is very important you've got to keep people on their toes subvert their expectations and often a specific theme or a good story or well there's plenty of ways to weave a narrative into a video be it a gaming video or just a trip to the shops sometimes simplicity works very well on YouTube to be clear and concise at times take a simple idea make it look and sound good trim the fat and you never know how many people might enjoy it with that said my plans this year incorporate the lessons that I've learned and continue to create regular and relevant gaming videos I'm not committing to daily uploads though and I will spend more time editing and crafting content in 2020 I've already drafted up a few bigger video ideas that will take more time to create but hopefully are viewed and enjoyed more and have the potential to go viral there will be different types of content both of what I usually make here too I would love to secure a long-term sponsor again that makes sense for my channel and my audience and also to start live-streaming more often and to sign a deal with one of the big streaming platforms I really enjoy live streaming and the interaction on offer there is good my live streams in the past on YouTube and twitch typically have had great reactions from my regular viewers and I'd love to do that more often I want to show more of my personality in my content too and produce more videos which are just about the joy of gaming playing with friends and having a good time hopefully if you've been watching my channel in 2020 you've been seeing some of that so far I'm also committing to collaborating with more people and working with new creators outside of my usual sphere of friends it could be good fun and you never know what will come of it and that's all for today folks I hope you enjoyed this one let me know your thoughts down below leave a like if you enjoyed the video a dislike if you didn't subscribe for more hit that Bell and I'll see you in the next one [Music] you
