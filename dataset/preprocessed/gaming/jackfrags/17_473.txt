i just want to try something there they keep pouring out this tunnel but there's a little knock in the corner that i reckon i can get in just here i just want to see how many people run past [Music] that was all aim assist then just pull my uh controller oh the first guy got away okay those guys didn't notice me i don't that's a bad idea oh the iceman got me with the shotgun the death cam gave me away hi guys and welcome to battlefield 5 on xbox i thought i'd jump on and join the christmas noobs i can't even open the door there we go it shows you how much of a noob i am i'm not very high level on my xbox account and i'm not very good at aiming either but i thought seeing as we've got the series x now i'll give it another shot because i know a lot of you guys enjoyed watching that first video on the xbox series x although i didn't really do a uh gameplay video i just want to try and revive this guy just keep throwing grenades at him i can get you buddy don't worry but there's all sorts of players on at the moment largely because of xbox game pass i thought that made back yeah can whoa just heated itself i do want to try playing more on console i'm here for you i said this uh a couple of videos ago as well i'll just shoot a grenade then i was lucky i also got myself a little present for christmas i want myself one of the elite series 2 controllers which i'm using now i'm trying to get used to it i'm not using the paddles on it yet i need to figure out a good config for that it does feel a lot more robust than the standard controller though which is good that's a miss well these guys just running past and i've got my basic sten i don't think he's got any specializations on it at all i think we might have a little flank here hello chickens yes nice triple try and get the rest here ah but that's one thing i've noticed i was just playing operation underground and a lot of people are just prone on the ground like that is that normal for xbox it's just slugs everywhere he's in the corner can you rest me first can you rest me please thank you i appreciate it watch out for the tripwire mines we're at 11 pro already that's not bad i could do some resin gear man look at that kill i don't know what i was thinking it was right there this is way more chill than playing on pc you know just a lot more look there's another guy's on the floor prone a lot more relaxed i feel i feel a sense of chill coming over me as i murdered this guy shoot him in the back with my sten in that corridor yeah i think so yeah mate a nice little position here killed by a man prone on the ground again what's with this please i switched to the m2 on the assault class it fires really oh excuse me dude was trying to knife me fire's really fast it's a lot more difficult to control on a analog stick than it is with a mouse though let me tell you but i feel like the aim assist will uh help you got an ads first to get it though although sometimes it feels like it does lock on if you just hit fire thrown on the ground of course i must get better at it though yeah friendly i have to be honest as well i do i do quite enjoy the console experience nowadays i don't know whether that's because i'm getting older and then it's just a bit more relaxed but there's just something about having a controller in your hand can i get this guy with a rocket no don't push just having a controller in your hand no stress i'm not in super serious try hard mode either i'm just chilling i could actually um hello come back i could actually stream this game on youtube as well because i can't stream this when i play on pc because hackers just follow me everywhere and ruin everything i'm just wildly firing now but i could stream bf5 if i'm playing on console that might work i got dead you dead we're okay sure there was a dude here song and the second one just slide straight through the window that makes sense i need to get better at long distance shots though bursting a bit more that's fine that's a bit better that's a hammer pressing on the wrong buttons hey bit of luck there i think level 10 private first class grinding through the ranks on bf5 once again that was a bad idea the entire german army was in there good rest thank you a couple guys there oh that feels good i don't know if it's the vibration or but feel satisfied i do feel so slow to turn around though i wonder if i should increase my sensitivity a bit because i am on the default right now and i just did and there's another guy pronoun this is easy mode i like this a lot okay getting a feel for it now doing those little micro bursts okay held the trigger way too much there might be a whole squad over here somewhere where are they look how slow i am god i've got to increase it someone down here i've got a little nest here from guys there's two out now not good enough to get out of that kind of situation yet there's a little sniper that's up there and a smoke barrage this i'll give you some cover off we go hopefully they're not wearing a headset because if they were they would have heard that i got a spawn beaker just jump off maybe did rolly polly still damaged me though too high perhaps it looks like we're gonna win this one we were losing at the start so it's a bit of a comeback which is nice how was that a glancing blow that was signed on dead nice explosion i am really impressed with the frame rate this feels like a solid 60 now on the on the new console it's very good that was quite fun i hope you guys enjoyed that [Music] a bit more relaxed than usual perhaps but we did all right 49-16 not bad at all [Music] certainly a different experience than how hyper-competitive playing warzone on pc is at the moment but you know what we'll definitely do some more of this so i enjoyed that a lot [Music] leveled up some too i've barely got any guns on this uh console account need to play a bit anyways there it is guys if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
