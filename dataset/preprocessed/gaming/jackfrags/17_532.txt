so world war one then i'm sure that i've played one of those games before battlefield one i think it was called something like that it would be hard to not mention bf1 when talking about a world war one game but the game we're looking at today couldn't be any further apart from that in terms of its design and nature and if you like games such as squad post scriptum or hell let loose then beyond the wire is going to be right up your alley beyond the wire is designed to be a slower paced tactical shooter from a small developer going by the name of redstone interactive but the reason that it caught my eye was because they released an awesome gameplay trailer recently that did feel a bit the f1 at times so i thought that i would give it a go in this game it goes like this one shot from a rifle and you're dead you've got limited ammo limited movement and a limited user interface don't expect to be told when you've scored a kill either you just get used to it after a while and you know for anyone jumping in for the first time i'd recommend paying close attention to what team you're on so you can look out for a certain uniform because team kills are very prominent in this game certainly with the time that i spent playing it but that of course is due to some part in the trench warfare nature of the game and i mentioned squad and post scriptum earlier and unsurprisingly the core mechanics of those games are very similar to this one and they should be because the core code base is actually the same squad is built off the unreal engine and both post scriptum and beyond the wire base their games off of the base code of squad this has a lot of benefits despite the clear differences in setting squad is a modern shooter however beyond the wire takes us back to world war one and utilizing the squad back end means that your starting point of your game is already quite strong features such as in-depth ballistics soldier animations sound design to name but a few are already at a good level and then you just need to build your own game settings maps weapons and everything else around all of that of course it's not quite as simple as that but off-world industries i think have a good product in squad and these different era offshoots just prove that there are currently three maps and three factions in the game fris and some court and zonobek all three have a different aesthetic to them too frizz is a more open map with quite a lot of buildings linked by tree coverage and trenches i believe it's based on the sam river region and core on the other hand is the argonne forest so that's mostly trees and trenches with lots of terrain cover from explosions and lastly zonobek covers the battle of passchendaele so lots of eerily dead trees and scorched earth i played amazon core at night too which made the immersion even more noticeable and it's akin to a horror game it's quite scary running through the forest just hearing bullets whiz past you and then that moment of panic when eventually you run into an enemy and i think that's the most impressive thing with beyond the wire at the moment the immersion the goal in most of the modes is to attack or defend and moving together with your squad is key but even when you're running on your own and there's machine gun fire in the distance or artillery fire going off all around you it really draws you in and just a word on the factions in the game too right now we've got the germans americans and french forces with a view to adding the british very soon i played and covered the release version of squad recently so i feel like i've got a pretty good idea of how the games compare of course like i said they're set in a different era but it's definitely noticeable how much quicker you get into the action in beyond the wire compared to squad and at times it does feel like a more accessible version of that game and i think mainly this boils down to the map sizes some of the maps on squad are substantial that's by design it's not to say that the maps in beyond the wire are small though because they're not it's still 50 versus 50 players but i felt that when i died i was able to get back into the action pretty fast and i died a lot so i should know in terms of the weaponry on offer here you can expect a nice mixture because of the setting you're going to find a lot of weapons that are single shot bolt action but there are of course machine guns too i tried out the show show billabel and a couple of others and you have to play really smart when using either a sniper rifle or a machine gun because you only get a limited amount of stamina when sprinting but that same stamina is used to steady your aim so if you sprint for a reasonable distance and then you try to shoot your aim is going to be incredibly inaccurate as you can imagine that's not exactly ideal if you're a sniper and this is the same for all of the weapons to be fair but i found it more obvious with snipers and machine guns the upside to the machine guns though is that you can use the bipod to help you out there are also pistols shotguns and of course melee weapons i had a bit of fun with the melee club i have to say it was quite satisfying the reality is that world war one was absolutely brutal it involved a ton of melee combat and i think that beyond the wire is doing a good job of showcasing that bit of feedback though there were some negatives just for a second and one of them is a frustrating one for me because so many games of this type suffer from it and it's the performance i can't be too unfair because it is early access and despite running on the squad code base we have to accept that it will need time to be fully optimized it has to be said though at times that performance did certainly crunch for me and i'm running on a 30 90 and a top end i9 clocked at 5 gigahertz it's more of an optimization thing and this was most noticeable when you're going around built-up areas with lots of players artillery shells other effects going off all the time well they didn't help either it's the sort of thing that can be worked on and improved in time but it does sometimes make aiming quite frustrating when you're getting those big frame drops and stutters regularly i did notice a few other smaller bugs with audio and animations too although nothing too serious but there were some funky physics going on from time to time vaulting was a bit dubious at times too all things that i'm sure will be fixed as it is early access so i won't worry about it too much i have to say though that the menu system and the settings were really great though so that's another plus wrapping things up beyond the wire has been released into early access so if you choose to buy it you're not going to get a finished product and you should know that and i don't want to alarm you but squad was in early access for over five years but fear not beyond the wire is scheduled to release sometime in 2022. that's possibly up to two years of development to improve the game and add content and perhaps even a next-gen console release but i think the content thing is really important and key for me sure squad was in development for a long time but they had a lot of kinks to iron out and when you jump into that game now there is just so much content to get stuck into and if beyond the wire is to succeed i think they'll need a strong road map for new features and new maps and additions along the way just over a week ago though the development team did an ama on reddit covering a few points that players asked about for example they said that they're currently focusing on representing the western front of world war one so areas of ipr news argonne the somme etc there are currently no plans to cover the eastern front there will also be a weather system in place but it will only include rain for the time being when it comes to the vehicles there are currently none in the game as the devs want to focus on the infantry experience first before they start adding in vehicles and i do think that that makes sense they also made a point of mentioning level design implications and network resources and having played the three maps for myself i do wonder if vehicles would really improve the experience we'll have to wait and see i'd love to see a planned road map for the game too much like squad have recently done even with a rough eta of planned and possible features but maybe the dev team aren't ready yet to commit to anything and i can appreciate that it has to be said though it's a great time to be a tactical shooter fan right now you've got at least three great games spread across different eras to choose from and i did have some fun with beyond the wire it certainly takes skill to play successfully but it's perhaps a bit easier to jump into when compared to squad which could be a big selling point of the game and of course teamwork is key if you can get in a decent squad and communicate you'll have a much better time here and that's all for today guys thank you for watching do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below i just wanted to put this in the end here too today marks nine years of myself on youtube i uploaded my first video on the 27th of october 2011. so nearly coming up to a full decade and i can't thank you guys enough for completely changing my life and supporting me every step of the way with that said if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
