hi everyone and welcome back to battlefield 2042 today we're going to be looking at some easter egg stuff that's been discovered some really interesting things have been found and also testing out the game seeing what the performance is like today there was a patch earlier a couple hours ago that apparently helps with a lot of like lag and rubber banding or whatever because it's been pretty bad the last couple days quite laggy lots of rubber band and they temporarily fix that apparently by removing the motion sensor ball which is kind of interesting but that's been put back in now so yeah we're going to be testing it today and see and seeing if the lag is any better but first off we're taking a look at some easter egg stuff which i thought was really interesting because you know easter eggs are a huge part of the battlefield legacy in the franchise and maybe we'll see a return of the phantom program i don't know but let me show you something so this is on the discarded map and if you come to the big ship here over by d2 you have to be playing as mckay because i don't think there's any other way of getting up here but you see there's a little hatch here basically you just grapple up to it and then you'll see this thing but we'll jump across now this is a tiny little room and there's a symbol here with a light and some spray cans obviously someone's put this here now this there's a couple of theories all right about this so the first theory is that it could be a map or it could be marking a location on this level where you have to stand or do something so it could be the start of a much bigger quest or easter egg within the game don't know yet really and just to be clear i didn't discover this like i didn't find this this was posted on youtube and i thought that i'd come and check it out myself there's a guy called dress i think when i saw it first and it's just strange now the second running theory is that this is a homage or an easter egg for shadow of the colossus now in shadow of the colossus you fight against these giant monsters called colossus and on them in certain areas they have these symbols on or they look very similar to this and i've got a comparison image which i'll i'll show you guys in a second and essentially these are like weak points on the monster and you have to stab them and the reason that this theory is popped up is because it looks very similar to those images and also if you look at the mini map in the bottom left hand corner the name of this ship is the colossus so it might just be that that's what it is it's just whoever made this level loves shadow of the colossus and has decided i'm going to make homage to it right here and they've put one of the symbols in i think that's what it is i'd love it to be something deeper than that and the start of a quest but we'll have to wait and see now i'm going to show you the image because it is quite similar and i think this kind of proves that maybe that's all this is you know i don't want to start any wild theories or people going down rabbit holes or whatever as much as i'd personally love that to be in the game already but i'm just going to show you what this looks like pulling up the image now so that's what it looks like in shadow of the colossus very similar if you look at the bottom the middle the overall design and the shape of it it seems quite similar right but there's another image that someone made in the chat of another streamer that i'm friends with called hads and i'll show you that just now so that's a comparison image right there so on the left we've got the one that's in the game and on the right that's the one from shadow of the colossus now it's not exactly the same it's not exactly the same but if we look at the again the overall design and style of this with the curved bottom here these areas in the middle where we've got multiple layers even the bit on the right hand side there the edge very similar so i think that that's all this is this is a nice little easter egg whoever made the level the level designer maybe one of the artists just love shadow of the colossus and that's what they've gone ahead and done but it's really cool either way but if you guys discover anything else then do let me know just tap them back into the game now so once again just to show the new people who are coming in here this is where it is it's on the discarded map up here you have to use mckay and get a grapple and go up there and if i can go outside i can actually prove to you that the ship is called the colossus i think it's this side here big ships tend to have the name on them i don't remember if it's at the front or the back though thinking thinker phantom program is live trust me bro i wish there you go colossus so this ship is part of the law of bf2042 i think that's what it is but there are some other things on this map that were discovered and there's some really interesting things here i did have my phone with me i'll just see if they've connected are you on the server ads yeah wicked are you on the other team i think so i don't think that cone thing is anything by the way you don't no there's there's other cones on the map i think it's just an asset you know that's just ended up in the wrong spot okay where's the uh the little eggs that you guys found are they on the top if you go to the the back of the ship they're on top of the uh like the funnels the do you mean the the broken off part or the main bit no the main one d2 right at the back of d2 oh yeah i'm on the wrong side head over there now like right at the back yeah it's in as soon as you get up there you see where the smoke funnels are you'll see they like increase the range of mckay's grapple hook or something i'll be honest it feels like they have since the bayer so like you can grapple miles now yeah it does it feels like that so on top of the white thing or like at the back you see you see that blue towel oh yeah yeah the funnels yeah it's on one of them it's in there is it oh yeah there's a bird's nest can you actually grapple onto it yeah you can get on top of it okay and there's some there's actually actually eggs in there too yeah there's two two eggs green eggs you can't interact with them or anything though no i tried blowing them up but um it's weird though because none of the other funnels have those in right no not that i can see just that one i think that's just another little easter egg just a little um i don't even know what to call it and that's quite well hidden though enough for george he just he just joined the game and went oh there's someone already jordan made the map obviously yeah he's uh he's got the inside knowledge and then there's the the big parts of the ship that you can move is that over uh e here over e east yeah this is interesting as well because this could hide things and not many people know this i did a video yesterday where i showed the details on some of the maps in the game and this ship you see those cables there you can actually interact with two winches and pull the side of the boat down and on the other side but adds who i'm playing with he was looking around this map this morning and he discovered that there's a similar kind of thing over here and it completely opens up this part of the map i didn't know you could do this i've never seen anyone do this in a live match there's one to your right there these winches are not identical on the other side i think the the issue is why no one's using these is that the cable is buried under the ground for a while it is yeah no interestingly this one isn't a two a two for either just a size just one yeah so if we interact with this it's gonna pull the side of the bar out very slow but the cable comes out the ground it gets taught and then it starts pulling it out i've never seen anyone do that he called me off guards because i i i didn't realize this was a thing it's quite slow isn't it does it kill you if you stand in front of it yeah i i would have thought so i'll tell you you just get crushed by it oh yeah it's doing damage to it oh no it's like that bit who framed roger rabbit do you remember that movie you gotta get steamrolled that's horrible like that's really interesting you can't jump on it while it's moving i wonder if you could just grapple up onto it oh yeah the slowest surfboard ever yeah it just completely opens up the point it's exposed like an entirely new entrance into that capture point still going yeah it goes quite far back but it really does change the points up quite a bit do you think call in a tank heads yeah get yourself a tank on the other side i want to see if it will destroy the tank oh in front of the other one yeah if we just put a tank in front of it what's gonna happen yeah drop yourself a tank in hold on it's gonna take a minute let me redeploy it might be quicker um i can get one ads you just take this yeah we should go and check out that boat as well like oh that sound completely disappeared then for me that's broken yeah we should go check out the uh inside as well yeah put the tank in front of it so this is the other side you can interact with this one here as well well i reckon this it should just push me along right i don't know because it was damaging you as a player with a myth busting hair odds look this some people say definitely destroy the tank if it pushes it it could be quite funny you're about to find out hans what would be interesting is if i could destroy the winch as the tank oh is it damaging or just pushing no it's just pushing me okay so no damage to the tank it's just fine shoot it then shoot the winch now see what happens nope nothing can stop the winch nothing the winches winch is okay so i presume you couldn't get inside these bits before there's nothing there but oh that's damaging me i'm dead ruined instantly when it's moving you're not allowed to go anywhere near it yeah it looks like it it's so slow as well hold on if i get out of your tank can you spawn back in it no no i'll just get a helicopter and come over it's fine oh no it's in winchable unwinchable yeah it can't be stopped it's like the train on goldman railway just impossible to stop it stand sideways i don't think that would make a difference flip saw it kind of look like the tank was pulling it yeah a little bit imagine you could just fake a you could fake a tick tock like that you can winch vehicles and pull parts of the map yeah alright mate i bet someone does that now are there any other winches that you found well it damaged me when i was in a um i was in here why is this um why is this roof area so blue as well why is it so blue yeah wait if you come up here when you when are you free you'll see what i mean i mean there's blue paint oh how do i get off are you mckay yeah is there a are there some stuff i love how you're asking how you get up you've left the helicopter on the ground yeah yeah we don't need that why is it so blue i think there's a lighting area there or something yeah it's weird it's weird maybe it's because the sun's shining on it and it's just like it's illuminating like it's making your character blue yeah you're quite blue there's woody from toy story there oh when you ads you you close your eye it was like that on bf105 wasn't it as well yeah you're closing your eye looks very strange you've got eyelashes dude do i have eyelashes well everyone has eyelashes so we're the same aren't we yeah it's quite blue i wonder if there's any others on this map what's on your backpack why is your backpack yeah why have you got lights on your backpack lights on my back yeah oh that's the enemy so is are they red for you yeah yeah yeah so the way it's supposed to work is if it's an enemy they have red lights on the front and the back and if it's a friendly they've got blue lights i'll be honest i'm never going to see that yeah it's difficult to notice yeah so there's a thing on the next map which we'll go to now oh i think it's a it's a little container have you seen this ads you haven't yet i i've had a look and i i haven't been able to find one like this anywhere else it's the only one i could find okay but i mean there's a lot of containers on this map possible sea monster william foster i don't know about that i've got a couple of others to show you actually and you can you can decide for yourself what on this map yeah okay now there's a there's a container on this map guys that's different from all the other containers and it's got a red light on it now unique stuff like that is usually indicative of some kind of easter egg there's a cool easter egg on breakaway i mean there's penguins but what else is that is that jeopard from discord by the way singapore is key to the flow of cargo around the world happy meal jack when are you gonna play halo i was playing last night i've got a video coming out truly you need to keep those russian troops out and you're trying to house you once you're on the ground you tried halo yeah i've been too engrossed at battlefield yeah i've been playing a lot how many bananas jack halo i mean i don't want to really rate it yet because i've only played it for a couple hours but it's a good halo game like on tc though i kind of wish it had a false like exclusive full screen mode because the mouse still feels a bit janky yeah you know input lag and um frame rate could be a little bit better but like it's a good halo game i was playing a big team battle and just tuning around on vehicles uh yeah it was good played last night so is it e2 a2 a2 isn't that something thank you for becoming a member what is that that's just the light uh where about zaya where are you now i'm at the flag what flag are you on a2 a2 yeah well did you say it was here you said it was yeah it is here oh this one here yeah i found it so the thing about this container is that this is the only one that i found has found so far and i think he's had a good look around that has a red light on it and it's got yellow black tape on it would suggest there's something inside that you shouldn't really get in there for now so these containers here you see this one here it's got a green light green light that means you can open it yeah they added that i think so you're thinking that perhaps there's a way to turn that like green yeah there are other containers that have red lights but none like this okay i'll come over here i'll show you there's another these are like military containers they're like cargo containers uh war daddy epic thank you for becoming members uh they're over here somewhere yes thank you for the five all right here they are see these here oh they've got come on yeah this is a different type of container that's also got a red light on it it also has a red light in the bottom yeah there's a different type of there's a little pad on it as well yeah those ones have got pads on them but these these ones that one in front of their repeats across the map okay so you non-unique assets probably means that it's nothing yeah but the one that we were looking at with the red light at the front of it i've not been able to find find another one like it yet okay if there is another one like it then that usually means it's not something right yeah i have a question i'm playing i've got this problem while playing bf240s on my pc freeze doesn't have to restart my pc am i the only one here no you're like a lot of people are having technical difficulties with this game on pc like it just doesn't run very well for certain people on you know different specs of hardware so i would just wait for some optimization to be done there was a new nvidia driver yesterday that's uh bumped my fps up a little bit but it's still you know it's still not very optimized i'm sure it'll get patched up don't know how long it'll take um a2 okay yeah so this um i can't find it in our hands it's the one over here which one you going back to a2 yeah you just get lost there it is but yeah it's hard to say whether that is something or i don't know can you try hacking it uh we've tried that haven't we we've tried using rao darkit there are absolutely there are other containers the red lights but there's none that i've seen like that one so why does that one have a light on it in the front no can you blow these things up yeah they're weird like um corrosive damage or something yeah oh and the other thing to consider is you see these cranes that move yeah that one's moving on the right they move containers about and one of the containers they move is one from here what do they pick them up yeah they pick them up no way oh so that that container that's on there now it'll go put over here and it'll go pick another one up and move it what's this problem this is set set containers though they're the same ones every time so it's just literally picked it up and put it down yes it will drop this one then i'll go pick another one up and then put that one down somewhere oh you can't jump on that you can get on top though can't you yeah you can so it's just going to go all the way oh so just restart okay um that's it's decided you don't want to play that much fair enough i mean i didn't do that but okay have you tried clipping through it um no i've not tried that skullsworth i'd like to try and figure out things legitimately rather than just clipping through them and napping thank you for becoming a member it could be that someone's just put a red light on it i don't but there's other containers with the um you know the ribbons that don't have lights so if it was a generic asset that the other ones would have the lights as well yeah but who knows yo jack i think i found it there's an interactive button by the electric control station is that true vulcan i think people would have found that already gaming hand thank you for becoming a member navy there's definitely an easter egg with that crane yeah probably airspace yeah i was i was trying to track where they were in the containers yesterday um i got a little bit bored from it to be honest but i was i mean they're very slow my theory was that maybe there's something involved with the way it moves containers around the because the only containers it moves are ones that are open on both sides it doesn't move any like closed containers there's a cone on this map you said it's just weird yeah i'll show it to you i'm pretty confident it's just an asset that shouldn't be there though over by a1 is maybe there's a computer you can interact with near the radar someone actually found a switch on that map i don't know i mean people say all sorts of stuff in chat well i mean it's worth looking at it yeah which point am i going to uh a1 a1 at the band a1 are they they can't still be around no there was a band called a1 it was yeah um what was their their most popular song was their first single wasn't it well i mean i i'm disappointed i even know they existed jack i i think you actually know that everybody get no that was five no that was five yeah so what did a1 make they're a boy band weren't they like in the early 2000's or something they were definitely a boy band did you jump out of that jet yeah that was me it's on the mountain here somewhere actually no they were like a rock band weren't they that's pushing it yeah they were rock bands yeah i remember their song it was i'm sure it was a rock song like a pop pop rock song um it's here somewhere it's right next to the outbound zone oh here it is we need you back i mean that's a bit sus if you ask me well it is but this come on yeah but that asset repeats yeah but why put one here well i know i know i know i i'm the same but could it just be an asset that shouldn't be here it's just a mistake no it's gone this has got to be something come on but yeah a cone all the way out here is weird i i accept it you can't interact with it do you know what i noticed as well and you'll find this out when you destroy it and listen out the plastic when it hits the ground makes a very large noise do you want to just have a very loud noise when you destroy it the noise it makes is quite noticeable my missus used to go out with one of the members of a1 well there you go it's a small world isn't it small small world that's so funny right so destroy it and listen out dude sounded like a drum or something yeah see what i mean though it's a weirdly loud noise for what it is you're destroying you think it spawned another one a bit further up here there are plenty of those around the map though like on the main road it's just that it's like that's full of monger size but jack or the alternative is it's simply it's just a sunny easter egg or a mistake no it could simply be an asset that is accidentally it's over there and it shouldn't be over there you know yeah that's very true i mean there's a that's definitely broken the weird textures over here that's the thing isn't it like the further you get to the out of bounds area the less attention and detail there's going to be yeah but that's expected you know like it's fine but also tumbleweed on this map as well yeah i've seen the tumbleweed also it could be great spots to hide stuff like imagine the amount of stuff that could be hidden on the breakaway map the snow map i'm not even sure i want to think about it like we'd be there for hours hans that's a floating rock oh we were there for hours on much smaller maps and we struggled to find stuff there's some more cones over here yeah i don't want to start going mad already with easter eggs you know the game's only i mean it's not even out it's like tomorrow it's like yeah but now's the time four cones what does it mean we found another cone there's four in a row here what in the desert just on the outbound area what but is it on the sand um well it's near the road i don't think this is anything it's just a bit of environmental detail yeah you can't just know you can destroy that i imagine it's just an accidental cone where it shouldn't be honestly right if i was a level designer on this game and i had control over what i could do with my own map you'd be the worst i would be the one i would hide things in the most obscure places that you like you would just never find like i bet they've done that though you know the size of them is there any other quirky stuff on the other maps that you're seeing um nothing i can think of i mean this solar panel array over here yeah like you could hide stuff on any one of these panels there's like 100 of them like on the back or something yeah you'd never find it yeah those cones were different by the way hats they weren't the same i think like i said i think they're just environmental detail they weren't enough jack they're the same they won't say it they were red but that cone up there was red no but it was a different model it was like thinner no wait wait you might be okay i didn't see what you blew yeah i was looking at something else if you go to the main roads just outside c1 oh there's some actual cars those cones do repeat definitely um yeah i mean there could be hidden symbols on the back of these panels that's what i'd do i'd just put like one bit of morse code here and then put another bit here imagine if there's a tiny symbol on one of the corners of these solar panels do you play this section in break have you played this map on break through no no i don't think so because this is what i don't understand about this map like i think this map is quite a good map but this area unless it's in breakthrough i don't really get it because there's so much stuff here so many solar panels but like i've never been here in conquest you know there's a part of um uh manifest that we were just on the side top right hand corner it's nowhere near any objective and it's like a park and everything up there i was looking around yesterday i was like i've never been to this part of the map well should we go well it turns out that on conquest small yeah it's a flag all right but on the conquest lads version there's no point of going ever up there because there's no objective okay um these explosive things as well like yesterday me tommy and bong were playing and if you blew these up they would just make the server rubber band and apparently this the patch today has fixed that so i wonder if it's actually fixed it in like a full a pool yeah these things that you can blow up are you making a huge explosion no no the big changes oh the big ones are yeah we are engaging that's a huge explosion i mean it doesn't appear to be rubber banded now but it's only me and hans on the server so who knows you would hope that you'd hope it wouldn't rub event well should we go back a month was it manifest you said uh yeah can you imagine how long like genuinely if there was if someone found a symbol on this map or any of them it would take you you'd be here for months just desolate easter egg hunters searching for nothing oh you can get up heads no yeah i made it up to the light what is there something up there ah i think i hit you oh wow it won't let me up now what is it is it a lighthouse why would you need a lighthouse in the desert is it for the solar array or something does it collect the sun i don't know why it's uh oh you can't really stand on it it just kicks you off you kicked him out right um next map it's mirrors okay there's a reload animation for the hook yeah uh rel thanks for the five john wick thank you for the five i bet there's a reflection in the solar panels at certain angles yeah this is the thing i remember when they put ray tracing in bf5 you know they had the real-time reflections yeah missed opportunity there for an easter egg but i think the reason they didn't do it was because bf5 only had ray tracing on pc and it would be unfair to console players if they couldn't take part in an easter egg but i always thought what if you could make an easter egg where you could only see it in the reflection of something that like if you had ray tracing turned on it's like a pay-to-win easter egg because this game i think has a real-time shadow so if you stood in a certain position and then looked at your shadow you know like the old like indiana jones movies or the goonies that kind of vibe where you could activate something with a shadow like i'd love that so it's next map isn't it next map again i appreciate that jack but what you remember is it's not just console players it's people who don't have rtx cards yeah it's a pay to win easter i saw that would go down really well and here's an easter egg for all the rich people goodbye can you imagine yeah they've definitely changed the the dr pepper in the uk i think it's got less sugar in it it doesn't taste as good anymore it's misunderstood think of people like will running his 980 ti what's he gonna do yeah one lucky will oh i'm ready oh i climbed everest it's been all downhill from there i climbed everest and it's been all downhill from there some of these voice lines are terrible man they are you know what would make it better hey if there's more variety in the voice lines if i could choose which one it was you could pick the quick yeah stay in trench we could face a global shipping crisis you see uh north of b1 what the little park area yeah just go up there that's an area i bet you've never been in a normal game on this map well because there's no reason to go up there no i've barely been to the like golf ball bit either there's a whole like beach area with discarded boats and everything that i've never seen before what dpi and sends am i on um i've got it the same as warzone in warzone i use 1600 dpi two cents it's quite low i might increase it for the 2042 though just because it's it's a much more fast paced infantry game so but the infantry fighting it is much more fast-paced yeah you're right i mean i don't i've not never seen this before no i i i when i was looking yesterday i was like sorry does this exist so this is in conquest small you said apparently there's a there's a point here in conquest well yeah but in congress lodge you never come here wait isn't that the u.s spawn no because we wouldn't be able to get into it if it was the u.s spawn no the u.s pawn is just further east from here like if you look at the map there look at e1 e2 and then look at all this unused space what is why does the server just restart by itself it's it's changed against renewal dice please that's so annoying the only way to fix that might be to only have one just one map yeah yeah i kind of wish you could edit your portal experience in game as well yeah even if it was just the basics of it yeah like just let me take a map off or something um well apparently it's an extraction zone it has a it's an extraction point it has its own as well okay stuff can land there it has a zone yeah oh i climbed everest it's been all downhill from there well i climbed ever it's all been downhill no shut up mckay [Music] they hint you to look for the easter eggs on renewables egyptian airspace and is bound for an agricultural research facility it's like the game's going no no there really is something to the cones go back go back be aware the area is divided by a large carrier limiting what if i do if i load the map and then restart it maybe it's worth trying jack what do you make of the gunplay weapon bloom i don't like it i think most of the guns have got too much bloom and spread on them the only like decent feeling gun in this game is the pp the rest of them sometimes especially at distance just feel like you just like i don't know it's like yeah what's a good way of explaining it trying to think of an analogy i was going to say pissing in the wind but then i thought maybe i shouldn't because it's youtube but i've said it now so yeah am i right have you tried the scar i've not really tried the scar no is that good no no it's not [Music] tried the uh the second lmg as well the pkp i haven't even unlocked that it's um it reminds me a lot of the mmgs from battlefield 1 but you need to you need to be stationary and use the bipod otherwise it's just very difficult to use i feel like the guns in the beta were better they were well i i believe i know what happened the assault rifles were too good so in between the beta and the release they've added bloom to the assault rifles probably to tone them down yeah and probably gone too far with it i think yeah i think it's gone too far um yeah the beta like the guns in that felt way just more accurate and i don't know yeah strange got the bison now which feels like a bit like an assault rifle because it doesn't really have bloom so it works okay but then the assault rifles just struggle i saw sacrile using this gun the only way he seemed affected was tap fire okay ekp slaps a couple of the guns you have to go through some pain with as well yeah cause the scars one of them the mp9s another you have to go through 20 a 20 round mag pain before you get some better attachments yeah i'm just restarting the map jack on hourglass there is a truck and you can blow the back open and there's a container inside that's currently locked now sherrock if you're not trolling where is it if you are trolling please don't because you know stuff like that like it could be true but you just never know think there's a bug with the max spread though and this has been in previous battlefield games where you'll it's it used to be something to do with sprinting and stopping and then shooting and then you would have max spread and you can see the bullets like going all around your red dot but then if you actually stop shooting go back to hip fire aim down the sight again it you you appear to have accurate fire again so i think there's a couple of bugs with the gun play too but we confirm that russian troops are moving into the port if they entrench we can face a global shipping crisis you need to keep those they'll have so much data now over the past week that they'll be able to hopefully just hone in on a few of these issues i swear to god jack let me hop on and quickly find it interesting dr wayne's did we show easter eggs already yeah there's a few at the start but we're looking for more now we're going to see if we can find some more stuff this was an hourglass did he say on hourglass here it's the one with the cool technology signs on them that's very vague i mean can you imagine how difficult it would be though to find an easter egg with all these containers on this map it's [Music] oh yeah the one thing is who am i playing with i'm playing with my friend hans he's streaming if you want to go check it out twitch.tvz oh i exploded we've engaged the enemy take them down and secure your objectives nice i mean that was a soft landing how do you get the ai to spawn you can just select them in portal let's ruin myself heads i'll run over there i should have adjusted the player speed shouldn't i well the run speed yeah you can adjust the runway there buddy how's that oh this thing moves even the finger the ushq moves heads i don't actually have the music on anymore that thing's moving why is that moving there is that gonna pick up a container hold on let me just wait what is that thing is it is it going to pick something up what are you doing picking this one up what if we could find a button and by hitting the button it stopped it changed the container these cranes picked up yeah that'll be interesting it's just moving away now tetris easter egg that's something i always wanted to ask why does everyone else pronounce zed as dead always p mike it's just the english american thing znz that's it but z doesn't rhyme with the abc song so what are you gonna do sorry z z does rhyme but zed doesn't there's a little building here had port customs can you get to this area you see me on the map adds say that again sorry can you see where i am on the map uh wait what point are you on um north of e1 e1 hold on i'll come over like i've never even been in this building it's called the customs building like what's the point of this like this just does it have data drivers in it it has a zone or something is it in breakthrough i can't really read that text i i know this is going to be controversial there yeah i'm going to say it anyway i know these might be in areas on other maps but on conquest do these areas need to be there yeah um and i'm not these areas here never really get played i don't think yeah it's probably so they can keep it consistent for breakthrough rather than having to load a different map or something i guess i don't if this is even in breakthrough i don't know there's all sorts of stuff on the computer screens about tornadoes and weather yeah i i do believe they change when a tornado comes close which is cool which is kind of cool in portal can you set it so there's always a tornado no but i think you can up the chances of weather effects like the percentage of them fire hose box f to pay respects not sure which building you are but there was one that i looked at in e and i'd never been there before oh yeah i see it's called port customs like it's just i mean it appears to be just an admin building yeah these buildings though like until i looked just as i had never been over here yeah i've never been here before because it's so out of the way hiju isn't that the thing from that movie with the big monsters and robots it's from um what's it called oh god what's it called i've got idris alberta in it a guillermo del toro one yeah i can't think what it's called though i mean there's a thing here you can interact with really that's what why pacific rip what pacific rim that's it look look at this where are you what's outside huh you can just what's with that i didn't realize that was a thing who's ever gonna do that well uh rao isn't he yeah but why there's nothing here open them all yeah open them all easter egg time let's go but there's loads now this has to be something on breakthrough right what would be the point in making all this if it isn't on breakthrough it must be on breakthrough can you confirm is this bit on breakthrough second to last capture point for breakthrough okay there we go there you go it does get used just not not on conquest stops vehicles from coming through yeah i get that but in conquest this is useless isn't it there's nothing here yeah i get why it's on concrete on a breakthrough now oh we missed one so many i've not really played uh breakthrough at all to be honest no i haven't it's too it's too chaotic for me like it's just madness well that makes sense why it's here though it's just it's just for another mode which is fine they all are they all up now why is that one red that one just broke there's more over here what does it mean what does it mean it means nothing the screens goes red mean this is right it's like a serial number some of the screens red by the way they're red yeah why is that one red i don't know i think it's bugged out yeah why is this why is this one red yeah but it's even random again nothing happens you can just interact with it look i think it's a bug oh yeah it is bugged you right it's weird wait can you not put them back down again does not like it what they don't go back down jack yeah can you destroy them no one's once they're up there up and when they're up they're up when they were down they were down there's a radio here they've got some modern art in this building kaiju corporation says seven to ten at the bottom do they make kaijus i know it's spelt differently but battlefield is in the same universe as pacific rim yeah imagine yeah it's a weird area this i think it's just for breakthrough in it so yeah yeah look you want to play something would you want to keep looking for stuff do you want to play some or do you want to keep looking for stuff yeah we can play a little bit yeah conquest yeah that breakthrough isn't for me okay well yeah there were some interesting things that we took a look at there i mean that first thing with the symbol my opinion is it's just a nice reference to shadow of the colossus i want it to be more but i don't think it is i think you're right are you in the past there's things to be found there though create party somewhere somehow yeah there'll be some big easter eggs on these maps that no one's found yet uh pc friends invite you get the invite oh hold on let me go to work time to go to work okay can you just not please i've i've unlocked paige but i've just never played as a ever no i tried it briefly have you just a little bit yeah just a just a smidge hmm i feel like i'm never going to play as boris in a real match a lot of people play as boris though yeah but why like the turret is not very good is it the turret's a little bit like the ranger though it it's terrible for a little bit but when it locks onto you it really locks on dozer is quite interesting because of the whole reflection thing yeah is there anything that we didn't test with dozer we tried tank shells we tried attack helicopter we tried little bird we bounced grenades off we bounced bullets off we tried c4 c5 sorry right there's just nothing that can get through the shield no i don't realize till earlier that c5 doesn't even exist yeah it's not real it's not it's not even real is that rao is good but i think he needs an extra thing he needs something else rau's best best feature right now is the fact that he can hack vehicles yeah you can dominate helicopters yeah if you're really struggling with helicopters if he can hack them and then get a couple of um you know aaa missiles onto them they'll be ruined and gail's very good sundance is very good i don't see many people playing irish or casper the only reason people are playing casper is because you can get the drone and you play breakthrough and you just spot everyone you get loads of xp i was watching story do yesterday oh with his drone yeah you know white star was doing that a little little minx it's because he couldn't use his his recon box uh are you in the party yeah the problem with irish is that he spawns with armor he gets that armor to start with and then he's got his shield yeah but angel can give himself armor repeatedly yeah you go into a fight you lose your armor you can give yourself more ammo angel's just a better character he's just a better character overall so shall i try the scar then no no okay um no well i mean yeah you try try it for a little bit and see what you think but the pb is clearly the best it's it's uh i don't particularly like it i don't think it's i feel very dis disadvantaged when i play with it okay i haven't unlocked anything for it i think um hold on let me have a look you start with a 20 round mag you need 60 kills to get the 30 round mag okay but yeah that is true the high power drum gives you 50 rounds on the score yeah but it's 330 kills so i mean it could be good you might just have to take some pain you know it'd be cool if um if you could just play team deathmatch like without having to make a server and paul yeah i had this discussion with uh people and they they were of the same mindset they wished they could play tdm and domination without having to go through paul yeah just having a way to queue up for tdm free flow so you can play infantry and just use your guns and unlock stuff i think that's why a lot of people made those xp farming servers to start with because it's it's quite difficult to rank up your guns yeah mohammed drunksy said the bloom is currently bugged and they're looking at it he tweeted that did it mohammed well that's good because then that that confirms that this wasn't intentional it's actually yeah if that's true drunks he did actually tweet that that's a good thing my progression doesn't track in portal team deathmatch yeah they disabled it for now donovan because people were making xp farming servers but they need to figure out a solution to this because they promised that you could have progression on portal and it's been disabled for the last two or three days so you know they need to come up with a solution pretty quick dispersion spread and bloom has been a thing in all past battlefield games it's important for weapons variety and balance as well as creating value for attachments it shouldn't be a problem unless it's too much or increasing too rapidly which is the problem that we're currently looking at so the bloom and spread is increasing at a rate than it shouldn't be yeah okay that's probably why your guns feel like they're pissing in the wind then and so what he's also saying is that people saying that they should we should have a gun play like battlefield five he made a point of saying that battlefield 5 did have this same system it was just at an amount that it didn't feel intrusive or intrusive whatever intrusive spawn on me if you want if you want to be a gunner all right i don't have the correct rockets equipped just so you know so i'm probably dead that's not the attitude of a professional gunner that's a wildcat there isn't it chop right now right i know it's smoked wherever hasn't come i think he's going to hit us here infantry hovercross are we taking a hit here i think oh ruined instantly yeah we got um we got locked by two anti-air and so score then yeah i'll try it out with you okay give it a shot or character on mckay i didn't mean to pick mckay until you get five kills with it scar this has been a problem in every game the iron sights are very nice oh god they're trash okay well that felt okay i could pretty accurately kill that sundance there i haven't used it today it might feel a bit better now yeah i do i mean i do wonder if those patches they released earlier this morning have actually improved the lag i mean i haven't had any yet but we've only just started playing on a real server so who knows i just feel like sometimes the um 20 rounds in this gun isn't enough it's like i'm pulling bullets into people and yeah i run out of ammo i mean it seems to hit pretty hard ads i have to be honest yeah it does it does it's just um damage appears to be high you feel like you're at a disadvantage against a bison for sure okay stay away get back helps when they stand still oh yeah definitely spawn on you we need a a vehicle hovercraft is what we need the vehicle's on its way there's some boom oh i just clipped him in the front there sandstorms coming hands there's a tank world cup out there let's go um i've got the grenade launcher on this by the way and it is ridiculously overpowered do you really like it dude it's so good i mean it's stupid like i'd rather they nerf it but while it's in the game people are gonna use it loads maybe people around here yeah are not right one dead you're trying to revive right in front of overcrowd mate you're mad oh god this is fine okay got him enemies on the other side of the point that's a traffic light i can't kill that watch out for the barrels and they're dead oh left behind us maria i'm sorry right on our right now am i right is that mine on the ground what is that let's go get him i think someone's killed him christian bale get out of there fast the um the bolt drops on team anti-tank mates behind it what sorry the bolts the vehicle it can drop fancy tank lines watch the bolts it's um it's a call-in that you get when you're level 50. all right it's the one with tracks oh yeah i've not even used that yet seen it behind it have you had any rubber banding yet not today so far no okay well you were playing for a couple hours were you yeah you never know though because it's still early in the day isn't it it's only mid afternoon so this evening will be the true test if it's actually fixed i said it will be the true test tomorrow a launch day i launched it i'll be the first yeah you think the service is just going to fall over tomorrow well i hope not they've they've prepared right i hope so [Music] it's quite quite a storm over here it is it's quite stormy do i have crossblade on yeah i do hunter come on come on i don't know why you can't jump over [Music] hmm we've been hacked i can't use my gun yeah we're getting packed you're gonna have to run people over yeah we have to run away oh that's such a good counter to any vehicle yeah it is because i can't use my smoke or my flare we're not flares but you've got no cam oh no that's his tank oh no it's one of those weird things big boys to get out of the vehicle i'll distract but i think i think i'm done for yeah suck on this i decided to distract by there's not much i could do there stadium's a cool area to fight over i like it uh you there now i think i'm going to spawn there yeah okay did dice fix the fact that the hovercraft can stick on any surface no they didn't that's a and you know what i hope they don't fix it yeah i mean that's just it's just a fun battlefield that's fun isn't it like the the problem with the hovercraft is that it's armored it's got a smoke escape it's quick it's got a anti-infantry grenade launcher it's got also anti-vehicle weapons if you want and that takes no damage to minigun fire it takes no damage to minigun fire and also me personally i fired plenty of rocket shots at hovercraft and they just dust they don't do any damage and i don't know if that's a server problem or is that a problem specific to hovercrafts but the amount of times i've hit hovercraft with rocket launchers and you see the explosion but you don't get a hit marker and you don't do any damage that's happened way too much for me like that's no longer it's awful but how cool is this area here it just looks so it looks sick it looks amazing bring a tank in here me a dick please it's just a catch-all isn't it the hovercraft it can do everything is that a player over there wait this is pre-recorded no no it's live my friend gotcha the amount of people that come into my streams and say that i don't understand say what i think it's pre-recorded or so i don't know well what so you've recorded some yeah i think gameplay just they just stay in the chat is this pre-recorded just so i replied to them there's a tank up here somewhere hands yeah i've got he went to the right somewhere oh no oh no oh no i've got two rockets i get it yeah i got him on my marker i want to go with the crane reaper's hacks what's up man man i missed the streams well there's gonna be plenty of battlefield streams yeah oh no i'm not playing mckay yeah slowly climb up what the hell it's what we're going to do we're going to climb all the way to the top i think so yeah okay i'm game oh you're falc are you yeah where's the times my go to the resources are at 50 how is the sniping on the game jack um it's okay like the bullet velocity is definitely faster i think than saying bf4 but it's still quite challenging it's not easy it's not like warzone where you you just get insta beam sniper rifles you have to get headshots as well to get a one-hit kill unless you've got the last sniper which is the nt ntg 50 or something it's called and that will one bank to the chest if they're not wearing armor ads can i i wish i could lend you my wingsuit well yeah but then what would you use um right i could clone it maybe you you wingsu and i'll get there eventually hang on what if we can can we call in a vehicle here i'll call in a vehicle on the roof yeah we need a transport vehicle deployed at my market and then we can fly off the roof in a hovercraft you get hovercraft yeah it's coming right in look at this oh look at that all right let's get a bit of a run going hold on we're gonna try and fly here are we yeah yeah we're gonna fly right over now if the flight does end wrong we will die okay as long as you're prepared for that our forces control most sectors that was all right that's fine look absolutely fine like why did we take damage from that because of the the landing i presume didn't know the london and we're dead we've been terminated apparently i so what's happened there we've flown off a stadium i've been fine and then we hit i hit a bus stop bus stops in the year 2042 man there quite strong what see this elevator's here but you can't interact with them have i got [Music] are there people here still at the stadium no i don't think so that's a dead meme now stadium okay got to start securing sectors oh that elevated does that just go down then why am i freezing to death in the elevator is it really that cold in the elevator no here it just goes down there what's the point of that how is there cc on a live thing uh dizzy so the way that youtube stream works is the you can select a delay so my delay is about 30 seconds and because of that delay it means that i can have closed captions on it so if people are watching that want to use closed captions they can i think it's a cool feature it's really accurate as well like picks up what i say pretty well oh there's several enemies here hunts for the stadium i mean they're throwing about six thousand grenades i mean there's a lot of them here on the left i'm reloading we stopped him cool yeah i think it's a cool feature of youtube streaming still just live caption yeah yeah it just it just auto translates what i'm saying but it doesn't translate it sorry it just changes is actually pretty good well if you say something now hello i am not jack did it work guys ow oh there's a lot of people oh pp yeah there's a lot of people here um they're all at b1 look let's go find there for a bit top five with the score pretty decent i'd love to have a site for it though that is the worst part you must have five kills but is that all you need for a site yeah i think the red dot sights you kill you as well no i haven't spawned yet even said pp there you go not 100 accurate but still impressive okay when you say pp it says it literally okay peepee what did it say then okay i have a site you're right um it's born you have a site for it yeah i've got one now yeah it's got a red dot sign on it if we goes stop them they'll take every sector you can't get under barrels though for it right like it's just grenade launchers uh yeah how do you use the grenade launcher on it you just press x and then you can go jump like that ow wait what was what's the key me x oh got smacked in the headlights yeah but it wasn't by a sniper okay that's a really bad bug as well when people are dead near walls you can't revive them it doesn't have any dip on it really lots of peas and bees yeah apparently it translated what you said perfectly i mean if you can understand what i'm saying then it is a good system and a tank yeah i'm just respawning got it and which one's still up to get snipers on the hill did you run out of ammo so quick in this it's just behind that tree you got me thank you oh the person mode that's poked i'm back i'm trying to kill this guy okay yeah they're at the top they're tanked as well these nights out i think they're still on a hill i'm i'm gonna run up there okay yeah the ammo is a real issue with this well yeah but once you get a second ammo uh type you can just switch between them what's oh there's a hovercraft on the hill oh cool cool look he's literally not moving he's just stood there it's so annoying gotcha oh no he's at it now please you know what be cool with the nades if you could tell it to prioritize certain targets like let's say i could set my nade in the options with sundance so it prioritizes ground vehicles every vehicle yeah well sometimes the only frustration i have with it is you're throwing it and you know what you want it to hit yeah but it actually just tracks something completely different there's a lot of people around me um i yeah there's a lot of people there when the stadium is popping off again steve thank you for the five marcel thank you for the two months is the plus system bug because i can't switch ammo types i just do a broken wrist animation it might be there's a lot of things broken in the game right now so i suppose it depends on what gun you're using back at stadium whoa i've fallen off well there's lots of uh lots of men are they downstairs yeah outside okay hold on just a man in the corner come on come on thank you you have to try the mp9 i'm not unlocked it have you got the mp9 yeah good it's good it's just it starts with 20 grand mag when you unlock bigger mag sprit though it's really nice i like it yeah i think you could make a really nice build for this car oh god oh my god a tank and hovercraft i've hit the hovercraft twice but it's not enough what with m5 yeah he's bailed from it every time twice now i hate this freeze like it's so annoying there's a freeze coming i don't quite hit that guy in the head there spawning back this cryo damage is weird oh they just called in they're just calling hovercraft ads are they still out hold on re-combo have some of that and lag oh yeah there's loads out front now i got sniped down next to you oh i'm i'm well dead even andrews any news on my in-game chat will be turned on seems weird without it it's not in the game stephen i don't know if they're gonna add it you can chat to your team but there's no wall chat i think it should be an option i think it should be default off and if you want it on just turn it on in the options save for the scoreboard you know bring the classic scoreboard back just give people the option what we need to do we've got 140 tickets what do you want to do sorry we need a hovercraft yeah and then we need to go out front and deal with these guys the tank on the roof that is going to ruin us no he won't he will he literally well [Music] you're not even in i didn't realize i'm trying to deal with this tank can you get to me hold on are you smoking hit the tank once see we can take him out hold on let me reload he he won't be able to fire this though he's gone i think he's dead i think he's dead yeah there's a guy on the roof though sundance i think it needs a voiceover as well i don't know why the game hasn't got a voiceover ip yet people here oh as many people love this uh there's a sun that's nadine got smoke oh i've used it we're healing now sniper down here hey carlo what's up on the left this one on our right is the one with the grenades oh sorry i should have focused no it's all right there was there was too many recoil this is right a dozer well the thing's a tank like if you obviously if multiple people are firing rockets at you you will die their yeah they're still fighting here i mean it's close matches i need to fix that sliding mario thing as well like it's so annoying it's a bit weird isn't it holy crap there's a lot of people here they're all below yeah i've just spawned in a chopper but our forces controlled most sectors see we can throw an aid on them i'm a bit of that lads i'm sorry how did my grenades not kill like 50 people then i don't understand dude i threw two scat grenades on a group of eight people and didn't get a single kill we've got dozer shields i think that's why i'm told that apparently there's a bug right now when your parachuting your your parachute becomes your hitbox have you experienced this i told you well i wouldn't know because we've not tested it so your whole parachute you can hit put someone in their parachute and it will do damage it doesn't surprise me i've seen plenty of hitbox bugs already that's a pretty bad one though because it makes anyone parachute and like really easy to get i've experienced that myself i've not they put it back in the game i was using it today yeah that's the sensible [Music] i've got the pkp let's make some trouble you say it was all right chat is the pkp any good or is it bloom hell go go try it as i'm scared give it a whirl okay i mean we could very easily test the parachute thing but if it's a bug it might be hard to reproduce yeah i'd be interested i've just seen a clip of it now but it was sort of as they were falling and they got their parachute back out yeah and a tank shell hit the parachute and it definitely did kill them okay will they release more guns tomorrow i don't think so you okay no this is it for now what's up bengal how you doing ekp is like the m249 okay yeah 22 guns isn't very much for launch like i'd i'd like to have seen a lot more guns at launch to be honest works best when lying down okay hey shabazz what's up got some kicks yeah i might explore that scar a bit more in another round i mean i'll i'll tell you this it felt better there than when i'd been trying it the last few days you know it might be you know netcode related why i felt as though i was feeling pretty bad it felt more reasonable are still a bit of a disadvantage though against people using the pee pee because it's just so good at most ranges singapore is counting on you it feels i'm in a little tank i'll spawn on you everyone's on about 22 guns but how many guns does halo have different type of game though merciless halo's an arena shooter battlefield players are so used to having like a lot more choice as well when it comes to guns at launch oh you've got a minigun on this yeah i've upgraded it to the minigun oh baby i don't know what it's like though so you'll have to tell me it might be terrible if it's just the same as the hovercraft then in which case it'll be amazing hey zachary hey gabby unpaid troll what's up good hit fire close range right i don't have any attachments for it keep in mind so we'll see how it goes we just took an objective sector echo captured good work there is leaning enabled zero in the conflict was leaning supposed to be in the game i don't know locker i think it'd be cool if leaning was in the game though so you could do the remnants of old games though yeah it could it could just be a legacy thing that they've left in but yeah you could lean manually and automatically in bf5 so yeah it'd be cool if they put that in this game as well this thing doesn't doesn't have shift when you uh when you're boosting oh it's rapid electrodes come out of the way there's a tank on the left here if you keep going you'll get behind it yeah that's it hold on i'll watch out for infantry is he a friendly tank i don't it wasn't enemy tank he may have killed him something locking us yeah i'm not sure what delta has been secured yeah i think that tank died it captured a1 and a2 go get these any little bird here's someone on the left that minigun will probably do i'm not sure what the range you've got on it though the guy i can hear him yeah i think we're in the middle of the lines down here yeah i can't see anyone on top of the container yeah he's gonna find a rocket maybe i'm gonna move away into wiki a little bit okay there's an infantry on the coast here it's a bit dicey getting in there pardon the pun yeah just get shot from so many different angles nice kill there was someone on the left i saw running go to the left a little bit please be on that rock yeah yeah i'm running across the road now oh i think he was trying to see for us oh good god don't even know insta what kind of did they have there was a rocket no idea i think we might have been hit by a recoil list just before it okay um all right b looks a bit mad there's so many infantry there although little bird i mean oh yeah yeah this is you getting it jack i haven't had much luck with the uh the vehicles today i'm just getting burgled i need the anti-personnel rockets hopefully that tank doesn't have an angle on me there one of our objectives has been lost yeah you want the 30 millimeter cannons isn't it for the yeah little bird they just ruin infantry oh these rockets are pretty good but they're not anti-infantry really they're supposed to be for vehicles i'll just level up then there's a quick lad here there's people just hiding in a room here with those shields blocking the entrance interesting tactic though well it didn't really work out for me i'll get wrecked dude i'm sorry what are you doing that hein just stood there and took it from me but he's set up to do it he's an absolute monster isn't he behind someone's going to hit me here i'll dodge it oh no i dodged into the water oh god is there someone in the water with me yeah i went too low and i just sat myself so basically what he's saying is you you ruined yourself yeah maybe i did have the anti-personal rockets on got to start securing sectors uh what okay dude the pkp rate of fire is insane yeah i didn't expect that i thought it would be like a dun dun dun dun dun kind of thing the first people is quite handsome holy recall oh my god that's a significant amount of recall on ads well yeah i think it feels like it's set up at first a bit like a like an mmg yeah you need to need to really be using the uh the bipod as much as you can i think and then it's far more manageable i mean there's going to be enemies on this point all right i'll try and cap it i'm on c1 if you uh get a spawn oh where is this now i've been sneaky bakery here there's no way i can count this by myself yeah mr white cat the recall is horrible it's one on the point with me two people now i'm so dead three people now hey lads i was not going to shoot in case they didn't see me it's a laser yeah that was good how do you use a bipod is it automatic when you go pro i don't know do you know hans most sectors are now under our control do you know about the bipod heads do you know about the bipods [Music] you know about the bipods like how do you deploy them do you just have to go prone no i think yeah if you go prone or anything it just works coming for you there's a sundance landed on me somewhere yes ma'am oh it was you wait there was i swear i got killed from where you came from i killed him yeah excellent two people are somewhere this pkp is mad dude love it are you still using the pkp yeah yeah no attachments very good i didn't really like it i didn't like the way that it worked let me test the recall on it okay it's got very strong initial vertical well it's recoil same with the scar if you look at the scar the recall of the first bullet is the worst really quite easy to control it though because there's not much horizontal on it so you just drag down and you put everything in one place for 200 shots as well i see that doesn't seem to do anything maybe it's an invisible stat kind of thing it could be three times seems a lot better with these scars well the visual recoil is a lot less all right it feels better anyway apparently you can put ammo crates and health crates on casper's drone and flying around that's funny you've seen the banana with a clock on the 15 min and that breakaway mascot so if that's true which i believe you because i know who you are there's a banana with a clock on firestorm and there's also a banana with a clock on another map in bf5 so i think it's an easter egg from that level designer but where is it mascot is there also did we get to the bottom of that hourglass easter egg as we mentioned um i don't think they they just said they were going to go into game and try and find it if i rope don't forget have a look for after um you want to go b2 yeah i just died in and around the lots of people there is one of our active targets up there we oh the helicopter just decimated that i'm going in with my pkp it could be agave how'd yeah you're on b2 aren't you oh i'm being chased it's playing i think oh man didn't stand a chance there down on the top of b2 i'll come get you you put the bloody shield down and actually did what he was meant to do and nodes on it right below us i think we're gonna be rushed there yeah we're gonna i don't see him at the shield [Music] hey they've gone oh they've been cleared out someone got him let's be one then ow like can i deploy it here and just like get a mounted position or something the deuce don't you worry about that mr frodo thank you all right let's see the point the revive system is a lot better from the bay here as well although that bug where they're next to a building or you know that's yeah rangers take so many shots too many would you say um i don't know because if they made it paper then no one would use it yeah so it's just a balance isn't it you know they've got to get those numbers right this map around this area doesn't feel great to me it feels quite in terms of how it plays or performs no yeah in terms of performance yeah my fps has definitely dropped a bit here i can feel it's gone i'll lower a hovercraft in uh we could put one in there put it outside here on the oil platform on the back side okay just take me to any infantry and then i'm going to show the stream how good the great launcher is did you just kill someone two shot kill there you go dead now this should work against other hormone traps this honestly they need to nerf this asap because apparently it's really bad in breakthrough like this like again i haven't really played it but based on what i've seen watching people like start and reading social media and reddit apparently i'll break through this combo is just stupid and the attackers never win that's a tank don't go in there yeah i'm not going there i'm lit i'm literally turning around i'm gonna go back up this way yeah this thing is stupid is it crazy aim assist like in warzone stefo i've not used the controller but from what i've heard from controller players there isn't much aim assist it does have aim assist but it doesn't have the rotational aim assist that warzone has behind us in that bush is he gone see how much quicker that kills than the minigun yeah it's too short as well obviously it needs to be spooled doesn't that sound and you need to have consistent aim this has splash damage i suppose that the where the miniguns go is we've got a load of people and it's spooled this runs out of ammo doesn't it yeah that's the only thing with it you've got to be careful don't blow your load you know yeah a life lesson [Music] there we go can't quite get an angle there where did he go look at that silly silly uh yeah there we go here's the people and this is a live demonstration of why the hovercraft is stupid i got two shots any hovercraft there he can't damage us he shot me how did he get me hold on he shot you out i think all right what weapon is that it's the grenade launcher i'd say skip was going to try and get him how did he shoot me then he shouldn't have been able to no there is seemingly some some occurrences where you can get shut down let's get away from that yeah that was a bug maybe that he could kill me there just get away from him yeah i'm getting the hell out of dodge oh there's a amino acid can you can you damage that i don't know let's try yeah i don't think it's doing much damage to it oh okay fair enough maybe it is why is this going so slow i don't know we'll disable these type of tracks maybe maybe it's like he just accepted it and just like okay i'm dead they're capping e2 what e2 we go well this could be dicey though put it in there put it in there hold on is that a fan it's a hovercraft oh god yeah maybe go go tank i'm a little tickle you know on the way why not pick all deco we're gonna we're just gonna do a handbrake turn around here i don't know it works it still works it's fine it just works enemy front here yeah last time 150 degrees 70 meters away from me i can see you there's no point hiding what was that oh now we're in trouble what is it there's a tank right behind us that's okay you missed how did he miss us how did he miss his hands well i'm not entirely sure another one there yeah behind this container i mean these people absolutely hate us right now i just this guy's just spawned there's another one yeah behind here [Music] this is silly isn't it i mean yeah it is these people are going to uninstall their mini map here around these containers they're right on your right it's here somewhere on the other side of that oh he's on top he's on top of this container here up here nothing can hide from the grenade launcher have another get around that oh we've been hacked our bloody menace has got us it's rao all along a couple of rounds could just own us yeah but even when they hack us they've still got to find uh something in the game that can destroy us on top again and everyone's ruined and you're ruined on top are they on the top there yeah we definitely got hit with the sundance tonight yeah sniper there i maybe i hit him in the head it feels like you're invincible in that thing doesn't it silly right this game does have in future combat yeah it is it is mad it's so broken isn't it come on if a hovercraft could damage another hovercraft like i presume it's meant to be they would kind of balance themselves out a little bit yeah but ah down on the ship we must secure and hold those sectors otherwise this battle is like 40 kills from it yeah there's a lot of kills this pkp is sick man you can't move forward while you're prone which is quite annoying have you noticed that are you using it while you're prone yeah if i'm aiming i'm i'm sure in like bf304 if you're prone and you move forward it actually moves but it doesn't do anything here [Music] because if you're not prone or crouched i do find the recoil to be quite mad sometimes quick reload i'm going to take about 20 seconds there's a man on the top yeah there's multiple on on the point here they last ages there's so much smoke here i can't see a thing away are you still at the top here the um the wing suit is fun as well though isn't it that's great when you just you kill a few people wings it away it's it's interesting nice try buddy 10 degrees 70 meters away from my position ow what go up to the top yeah i don't even know where oh you're there yeah i'm heading towards the i get up here without dying i don't know we're heading to e oh i know he got sniped then no there's a hovercraft my enemy the nemesis i know it's a tank actually they just feel like the same thing they took sector charlie a couple of these nays i didn't even know those vehicles were there you know there's a problem when you confuse the tank for a hovercraft yeah that just happened running low on most everything andrew what's up there's a little bit you can jump up here too tomorrow taught me this the other day jump up there on there and then you can walk all the way up to the top and put a spawn beacon up there like this the hell am i being shot right oh i see him he's got that he turn it on top of the crane turret on the grain this is the ultimate spot here you slow ready yeah yeah you are you're right on top of it yeah i don't think you're supposed to get up here have a good time over there that's all right let's throw some nades down at the point echo objectives both sectors are now under our control objective we'll need to retake it yeah they know i'm here now well we've got it these uh sundance grenades aren't very effective the scatter ones no well i think they could be frustrating to play against but they're kind of kind of situational really they're just really difficult to actually like classic scandal they don't do that much damage on their own so if you're only getting hit by one it's not that bad yeah i think if um they were too good as well it would just be annoying it would become like battlefront you know stay back stay back there's the music just keep going going i got it i'm in the open [Music] i've got a this ui is awful still i can't stand it i need two more kills for a sight what what's up luletros how you doing did you you were overwhelmed we must take our losses and retreat while we still can that was a good round no no we got plenty of kills there was fun though a good day's work most revives fights like that keep you sharp well i mean yeah it's fun when you're using the uh the hover beam isn't it 635 seconds that guy stayed alive for [Music] interesting is the last smg to unlock any good is that the vector hats the last smg the vector yeah it's probably insane oh no yeah it is insane um as you'd imagine insane rate of fire it's just it's another one of those things where until you get the better attachments for it it's hard to judge because you only get a 20 round mag right so it's just very much that's so the most you can get is 20. no no that's what you start with so until you've got some kills with it and unlocked about a mag okay let's go i mean it does delete people there's no doubt about that deletion protocol is it you've got the high power rounds to start with which is a 20 round magazine but you can you can get a 50 round max no a drum bag no 300 kills together or even there's a 40 round mag which is pretty good to be fair i'd cancel that because it was putting us on manifest again 90 kills for a 40 round mag i mean in a vector that's pretty good i think yeah that's insane that's 1200 rate of fire as well see this is what doesn't make sense to me first unlock is the subsonic rounds 20 round magazine worse reload speed better tracer visibility okay or vice versa whichever one that is then the next one and that's 1100 rate of fire the next one gives you 10 more rounds of the mag improves recoil and up to the rate of fire to 1200 i just don't see why you wouldn't yeah you would you just yeah absolutely am i crazy or can i only get revive my squad matthew darby you can get revived by your squad but you can also be revived by maria this one and angel if they're not on your squad they can revive anyone it's just people aren't really reviving that much that's how battlefield is it'll get better as the team play improves and people learn the game a bit but for now don't unless you're playing with someone you know on comms don't expect to be revived [Music] i think yeah what's the pp build then uh i'm currently running you on the 64-round mac i presume you do well either that or the one before it that the high power round uh magazine is really good as well it slightly reduces the rate of fire but it gives you 50 rounds and it's it drops people okay look at the bag just jiggling around [Music] i use the warhol compensator but it's like one of the last barrel unlocks so yeah this gun actually feels like a battlefield gun compared to all the others you can just tell though as soon as you start shooting it just feels like it works yeah it feels like a real gun [Music] i like this man it's cool man what other specialists do you think they'll add like what abilities would you want to say well now this is a tough one because i'll be honest i feel like they're already stretching it with some of the abilities we've already got a load of specialists that i don't think that many people will use so what do you add to make it interesting no you just got to think about like what's useful and what can enhance team play because i think the specialists like they don't really most of them someone that can fast repair vehicles or something like that but yeah these people are people gonna do it there's a hovercraft there vehicle repair from a distance all right i know it's not really feasible but it's the future i could come up with all kinds of stuff do you think okay consider this they have a ranger in the game which is a robot dog that runs around and and shoots people for you right yeah is it conceivable they put a specialist in that had a drone that flew around and shot you yeah why not i personally would hate that the categories don't want to yeah i think i don't think that's possible belongs in a battlefield game but maybe they might do that the other thing they can do to improve team play and element is the two classes that can revive need to be able to revive way quicker than they currently do yeah they sped it up from the beta but it's still quite slow it's still really slow with marie maria i i would expect to be able to click on someone to revive yeah like be a three star right yeah i understand they don't want that normally but if i'm the healing specialist i would expect that okay well i'm shooting this man's parachute and it's not ignore me it didn't do any damage but it may not have the bug of israel but the pp is just so good so much better than any other gun like you can actually shoot people with it what's going on i mean what the hell dude it's insane yeah it's not it's not even like um it's really good the standard version you've got is fine yeah i've just got like one attachment on it for why it's because there's no underbarrel on it oh i just got sniped so you're not actually missing out on that many attachments that's why you get you as well yeah oh dude he wants on both of us yeah on top of the roof here i want revenge on that guy has i was crashing around as well he still hit me in there yeah maybe he's a good player i need to get some height wing suit down onto it time for revenge let's go there's probably a couple of specialists that need some tweaks as well though right oh for sure yeah like rao like we said earlier i need that extra work our forces control most sectors that's a good question can you put a remote sorry on the drone why did you put a remote turret on on casper's drone and then just fly it around um i think his drone would probably be too small wouldn't it what do you mean boris yeah like that boris is do you want to test well today maybe when i i'm in a tank when i'm okay well let me know when you spawned i don't know why i died then i like that was weird i think that's a bug didn't pop my shoot quick enough maybe but it felt like i did situation enemies disorganized need to consolidate gains and hold the sectors i need my helicopter we are in control of sector almost every sector is under our control you can put c yeah you can put c5 on the drone yeah you just take damage when you land on this what are you landing on the roof this roof bit here when your sun dance you take damage on it and you drop it these knives out 200 minutes hit marker oh i just missed the tail it's in that time i'm in trouble come on come down what is that it's just the player prone okay wonder why he's taking damage j-rock usually with sundance you can just land on anything and it's fine it's the same as having a parachute i think though if you come in too fast you will still die maybe i was going too fast i didn't feel like i was ep is live pp is love the reason that's the reason people are using the visors because it feels nice to use and it's good just a real gun in it i mean oh yeah it's a real it's a real gun there's another shitload of spread on it so that's why people actually like it oh run into that flashing thing distracting me and maybe right chat maybe i'm just going too fast usually i just i just eat myself into stuff don't it's fine so yeah if you go too fast if you're coming in too fast it will uh too hot snap your neck oh someone just took over my helicopter okay i didn't want that [Music] both factors are now under our control i'll slide right down am i gonna take damage no there's a lot of people over on b1 yeah i'm trying to help on c oh they're coming over no resources but we may be soon running out locked locked on reload this oh come on i feel like i've reloaded it three times couple one there's a lot of people pushing d1 heads all right i'm gonna are they coming from b yeah oh there's a whole crack coming back around over the bridge i've suffered the wrath of the hovercraft um no not come hello matias what's up you know what it feels like now jack yeah i know how it feels you know the burn that all those players were feeling hovercrafted i'm just gonna keep chucking nades off i'm gonna give some support now there's a lot of people here our troops have lost an objective new supply drop ready someone here no that was actually do one yeah i'm just checking i don't see anyone outside what is this room dude it's so weird is it the one with all the screens yeah it's all white servers messes with your eyes i think they're just friendly footsteps i don't know because everyone just sounds like an elephant oh should be made to feel better like i think that's what i'd prefer if more guns felt like the pp than just nerfing it and giving it spread or something like it's the only gun that feels good really loads of people running to the point of ads there's so many i get an elevator up here i think there's an elevator here isn't it elevated music let's go chat do i know if bs 2040 will come with any cloud surface i think it's going to be on geforce now don't quote me on that though i think you could play it on that because they partnered with nvidia stop saying pp is making me need the toilet c2b i'm sorry i'm dead wrong side i looked the wrong way um should we try the boris thing cubs are you still in that time i'm still in the time amazingly i haven't died that's fine essentially that without you in here i seem to have survived i'm not saying anything it's all my fault it's just coincidence have you got a gunner um no someone's in the third seat but not in the second seat that's weird oh that bug's still in the game where enemies can change sorry friendlies can change their enemies have you seen that like this guy's got an enemy skin because it's red and i don't have the ui for it what the hell it happened once yesterday with a vehicle as well like i was trying to take out a helicopter and i was like why isn't this taking any damage and i realized that that book can also apply to vehicles jump in definitely get more fps on these drivers hey that guy's got the bug as well that's two people there hello yeah no the drivers are definitely better there's no doubt about that this dude there's some uh sundance's scatter grenades also damage tanks i don't know i assume they would do a little bit of damage i feel like they are doing damage to me trade kill pain nothing worse than a trade kill isn't it can you guys play i can't log in after the update siri yeah it just worked fine for me logged in straight away today but i did start playing a couple hours ago so things may have changed lots of people on one hand yeah we're still trying to can't be yeah everyone's gone well we are coming back over there we got it we have taken sector foxtrot objective lost we need to retake it promoted to kill me b1 yeah i'll go back to it on the point happening now it's clear now i know that i can't take my tank in there because i've tried previously and got it beached you can't get it on the cat point no okay and these walls don't destroy the hostiles non-destructible there's more infantry on the point i'm down hold on he's low though that mckay nice job coming for you superhero wrest the guy has been reviving me as soon as i got back he jumped out the gut he jumped out the driver's seat i love him teamwork make a dream work are you blocking everything what is going on there beside the building is it dead i don't know it's still it's just the hovercraft on the side of the building here huds is it going out i think they're using it as a spawn or something smart i like it i ran out of i've run out of rockets because i've shot so many rockets on it on the side of the building so stupid they're down to the last of their attack force yeah i'd definitely take a like why i say definitely i do believe i take a little bit of damage from the scatter grenades they've got it like jammed up there or something i managed to do as to why you would use the scatter grenades and not the anti-armor grenades though unless they're just throwing them by mistake yeah because you get two and then they recharge you may as well just throw the anti-armor ones oh come on that was the last kill there was retreating that was nice that map's good didn't like it at first but i'm quite a fan of it now no i do like that one job well done eh job well done uh benjamin thank you for the five been watching since 2013. happy 10th anniversary thanks man i told you to keep up helios can i say that i find it stupid that the smart grenade can travel 500 meters yeah i agree with you i think they need to know if the range of it a bit how is the player cheating has it been happening at all to you i don't think i've come across any cheers yet i haven't been killed by anyone and thought that was weird but there's probably there probably is cheats for the game already yeah wouldn't surprise me they're using a kernel level anti-cheat though now so should be more difficult haven't encountered anything the only thing i will say is with with the the netcode and everything and because there's no scoreboard or kill camera anything if someone was cheating i probably wouldn't know yeah to be honest let's go i've really done any sniping today sniping's really good in this it just it works really well oh gosh no i don't want to play hourglass again i want to play breakaway do you have dx12 enabled yes phillip i do i don't know if it does anything though because some people were saying that the game only has dx12 and it's just enabled by default anyway so i think there's a lot of placebo about config files and stuff i was graphics on pc on ultra versus series x much better i wouldn't say they're much better madonna like i've played i've played this on series x um the graphics are pretty decent though on ps5 and series x like ultra just has that extra level of polish though the lighting i think in particular is a bit better probably the texture detail article effects slightly better i don't know it'd be good to see someone like eurogamer or digital foundry do a proper breakdown of it like what the differences are is dlss working or not for me personally it's working at 4k at 1440p and 1080p i don't see much of a difference at 4k there is a bump in fps attack helicopter yeah i tried to get an attack helicopter but no bueno no bueno try the ak i'm not going to use that i haven't really used the ak very much oh that first sight is horrible no no no no no okay whatever no more battle nonsense feels bad man yeah good egg like he made great videos man no more about that yeah he's retired from youtube for now yeah he said he just can't do it at the moment real life and what have you i think so yeah that's a shame i didn't know that i hadn't seen that i'm not a fan of that site what i'm not a fan of is if there's no vehicles to get into well just in general i don't want the game to also deploy me yeah it's annoying because it takes out the menus as well doesn't it yeah it's unnecessary just leave me on the deploy screen until i'm ready to i think that whole introduction loop isn't very good like there's way too much time and the fact that it forces you to deploy like it's pretty bad yeah i wish it didn't force me to deploy because what could happen is you could just wait for a vehicle to cap a1 or something and then just spawn there have i played any goofy portal gamers yet like 1v50 or something um my friends made red light green light you know tommy and bong from angry gamers they kind of made a take on that from squid game worryingly uh a possibly worrying discovery here that what's that soft lamb locked is m5 shots aren't blocked by flares the same as it was in bf3 then so but with all that i mean with the grenades and everything from sundance that would be incredible that's gonna break break through but in conquest i'll be fine because it's a bit of team play i don't think anyone's unlocked yet though right yeah i've got it what level do you get it um 50 something 53 maybe yeah in breakthrough i can see that being really yeah breakthrough that'll be an absolute nightmare i think conquest is good because it's going to encourage a bit of team play but that's how it was in bf3 i just don't remember it being that i'm bad for three but i've got a terrible memory so it's because it's a laser lock rather than like a smart rocket that's the explanation for it in the lore of the game i suppose that's enemy tanks [Music] okay this guy on top of that crane is pissing me off [Music] hold on yeah i see him he's beaming me that was overkill but i got him both oh you killed him nice target locked i've got it he's still shooting there's still people look down yeah i'm getting missile locked constantly i got the other one just constant missile lock constant i think there's a a uh down there our troops have taken the ak has got burst fire mode on it both factors are now under our [Music] yeah i didn't know that i didn't know until i watched your video earlier about the yeah i didn't know yeah it's a good tip guys even all dogs learn new tricks us forces is certain control over initial sectors got the attack here though wrong rockets again man can i pick you up uh [Music] can you do 8v8 tdm cod style in portal you can veehan yeah but i think that kind of mode should be available in the main game just so people can quit you know quickly jump in some kind of official playlist where they can play without vehicles and just level up guns or something like that like if you want that experience you've got to go to portal and right now i don't think you can earn xp from porzel you do earn it's just not a lot tracking it's not very limited what that dust i just got my rocket went through the bottom of the hovercraft that's another big problem with the hovercraft as i mentioned earlier they just the hitboxes on them are screwed up i think he's got to do with the uh the inflation on the bottom part moving around maybe yeah it's a physics bug or something where you up dead i'm about to spawn can you get a healer all right then uh i am a healer yeah which one i'm playing as falc no he hilo as in helicopter hilo sorry i thought you said are you a heel can you spawn a helicopter no that counts warning there's none available jack but if you could spawn a helicopter as a um you know a reinforcement if they were available and it just came down ai came down and swooped you up what do you mean like as an escape or something no you know like you can bring tanks in instead of selecting attack yeah a hovercraft it's a chopper like a chunky helicopter down yeah it comes in swoops me up i take control of the chopper it instantly gets m5 recoil less than gg it's no longer secure well that wouldn't be good i'm at the ladder come on there's many people around me like i need to restart my game or something what the hell just happened that was so just had a horrible bug where someone did a takedown on me and it completely disconnected my character oh did you lose your head off your shoulders i just no my camera just completely shifted that's weird the k-30 is good but there's pain there's so much pain at the 20 round mag our forces control most sectors what does infantry die we're not short on resources but we may be soon um i'm just just i'm in here just spotting are you helicopter yeah i'm just in your spotting seat there's some sundance down here i think you see him just looking for him [Music] right below me trying to get this night bud oh you get it you get that i can't do anything in this seat someone just fired a rocket on it and killed it it's a little bit right out of here thought that was an enemy it's just a bird no there's a there was there was a sundance there they jumped off and you know they did look like a bird uh what do you think the enemies are d1 and c1 i reckon i get to d1 oh that crane came out of nowhere i promise i'm sorry the crane it wasn't there a second ago and then all of a sudden it just appeared i saw the crate and i i thought initially i thought oh we've got away with that i do think the game has a um i don't know if it's a memory leak but my game is running significantly worse yeah the longer you play the worse the performers get you have to restart yeah that's it i'm not a fan of this ak you know i mean maybe with attachments it's just got so much recall on it yeah it's tough to use weirdly it feels worse than it did in the beta as well someone up here that's what i'm hearing things i wish there was a way to auto select the grenades on sundance so that you don't have to flick through them it's so annoying every time you spawn you have to switch i could have just taken the repel i've decided to go with the stairs instead i don't know why i honestly think like a system you can bring the tt menu up and change them like that i don't know whether that persists so it's just much easier as a double tap three though in it well it is yeah but it's annoying one [Applause] on the roof hopefully this guy goes over there that's it go on get over there lad you can do it don't fall off no suck on yeah get the suck yes good lad right push end of the boat let's go don't fall off again you're falling off again get the suck get the suck come on no you're stuck aren't you no no no no i loved it you know hovercraft up there perfect position all we had to do was drive to the end fell off come on get me up there again you can climb up the wall maybe a lot of people on on the ship oh my game rose no we're back that's a wildcat isn't it our forces control most sectors i don't can't really do much about that we leave us alone wildcat i'm not interested the other thing is this hovercraft doesn't just have the driver seat obviously then the gunner seats it has two guns either side of it as well yeah yeah it's silly you just bailed out of it you can still just bail out of his that character's bug there the hell is this canister weapon it's like a scatter shotgun isn't it where's that on a tank don't go near that hovercraft that's it get away get away take me to the infantry please i would like to see the infantry is that a ranger maybe he's just roadkilling everyone now this is stupid has oh no use the smoke use a smoke ah it's a wild ride this is don't hit the explosives oh we're so close to hitting that that guy not for me this guy's an absolute mad lab driving this good job hank we're dead get going get going get going go go go go go he's got it stuck ah that was a nice ride while it lasted i suffered a spinal cord injury and can no longer play competitive fps your video is the highlight of my day oh david i'm sorry to hear that man thank you for watching that sucks dude hovercraft field yeah it feels like that is there an enemy here that's a tank again [Music] i don't know sometimes there's just errors in the top right hand corner it's not finished um tornadoes come in hands no not again ready for some worse performance i'm in right we're fighting this guy out the window yeah i've got the angle i've got the angry areas got him lovely uh nice can't damage that the guy right here got him oh it's just it's literally hovercraft walls hovercraft 2042 it might as well come to the new mode hovercraft vr i mean you could do how many do you think you can spawn at a time eight that's a good question did you do a map which was like just hovercrafts and then you do hovercraft battle rail hovercraft royale echo on your left hold on give me one second [Applause] there's a tank behind us hands you wanted him dead so badly i couldn't see his head i hit him like four times okay is he still there though that's the thing stupid guy hats is he still there i don't know i know he did it he's dead okay i got it i got him okay good i need some health hold on i'll jump in let's go did you want to go for a real exciting ride yeah sure i think there was a guy that won't know what the hell is going on oh my god where are we we're just flying without wings aren't we the tornado just eated us i'm right here [Music] grenade pain [Music] uh hilo you get one no you might be able to yeah ruined and you won't ever go in the um the hovercraft it's follow me get on that grenade launcher let me redeploy uh fresh hi jack thank you for the 10. i hope dye sort this game out not much to play at the moment yeah i mean there's a lot of bugs you know a lot of optimization that needs fixing some features missing i hope that they get to it i'm gonna need to be quick though right all right where'd you want to go well whatever away from the away from the tornado probably oh we've become a jet we were literally flying alongside the jet um so i need to find the infantry we've owned them at d we've got that hard [Music] left here at the tree is it what dead what am i hitting there i'm getting hit markers but up ahead get ahead dead ahead again left and right left and right in the building on the left left left i can't see the guy on the left there you go and they're finished they're left again in the buildings maybe yeah red building red building shoot the window top right window nice close right i swear the tornado is affecting my get ahead dead head i think this guy is he building building reload he's gone around the back of it ah reload oh this cool guy yeah again it's so good that is especially if you've got groups of enemies because the splash damage will do damage to two of them yeah it's so good i mean assuming there isn't another patch tomorrow which i don't think there will be hovercraft matters in it's in for the long run yeah you know how they just removed the sensor balls and the shield i hope they can change the stats of the hovercraft for the server patch rather than having to like certify a patch for xbox and sony and pc i hope so so you know fingers crossed i think that's it for me ads for now yeah that's fine they have to certify that don't they because we've got cross play now so yeah if they push an update which is an actual patch yeah they have to certify but if they can change it with this new system they've built that'd be ideal [Music] all right good games yeah good game catch in a bit stream thank you for watching i hope you've enjoyed this today didn't really experience any rubber banding which was good so maybe that patch has fixed that because yesterday there was quite a lot of lagging rubber banding hit reg seemed pretty good today as well um still lots of game breaking bugs though that i experienced didn't get the revive bug though which is nice because if you get that you have to just close the game let's make some trouble still got the bug where you see a friendly player as an enemy as well so there's a lot that needs uh fixing for sure um anyways there will be another stream tomorrow i think we're doing squad up so it'll be myself level cap x factor matimo we'll be playing for maybe three to four hours tomorrow so make sure you catch that if you're interested appreciate your being here if you enjoyed it leave a like thank you for all the new members and super chats very connie cool about those easter eggs as well this up bumper cars with hovercraft right enjoy the
