a couple of days ago i got to play and record star wars squadrons at a remote online event the footage that you're seeing in this video was all recorded by myself playing the game on my own pc and hopefully this video will explain why star wars squadrons isn't the game that i expected it to be and i mean that in a good way and hopefully by the end of the video you'll understand why so i thought that i would start things off really simple and just show you the basics of flying your starship in this game and i have to be honest it was a lot more complicated than i thought it would be so in this game there are four classes of star fighters you've got the fighter class you've got interceptors bombers and support and they all specialize in different things and can do things that the others can't also all of their cockpits are different too but they are consistent across the board in terms of the three main systems that you'll be managing while playing the game and those three systems are engines weapons and shields so here for example i'm flying an a-wink and if you look to the bottom left of the cockpit you'll see a panel with red blue and green bars on it and they represent each of those systems so if i press one on the keyboard that will put all of my power into my engine and diverting power to your engines will increase your speed and agility and it will also charge the speed boost stability that you can see building up there it's kind of yellow and that can be maxed out you can use just part of it or you can use it straight away if you want a short burst of speed but then if you press two you'll divert the power to the red bar and that's your weapon system if you do this you'll increase the recharge speed of your blasters and create an overcharge when they're maxed out so if you need a bit of quick firepower divert all the power to your guns and then if you press three you'll divert all of the power to the shields and that will increase their recharge rate and create a overshield when maxed out but there's another element to this if you use the scroll wheel back and forward you can assign where you want the majority of the shields to be do you want them at the front or do you want them at the back and you can change this on the fly so what you've seen there is a very analog example of balancing the power of your ship but these three systems can be individually tweaked in increments so it doesn't have to be all or nothing you can choose to balance this out however you like if you press 4 on the keyboard you'll just get an average all across the middle but the option is there for those pro players who will really excel in the game in pvp those are the three main systems that you'll be looking after in terms of the other ship controls you've got throttle up throttle down roll pitch up pitch down your left your right after burner you've got your targeting systems you've got the ping system so you can tell friendlies what you want to attack or defend you can bring your ship to a complete stop if you want as well you can do drifting which is just an awesome feeling and of course your primary blasters which we talked about just before they go in the center of the screen wherever your ship is facing your lasers will go and there's no aim assist you have to do this all manually there's no leading indicators to tell you where to shoot you've got to position your ship in a dogfight or attacking whatever you're attacking and do it all on your own the loadout of your ship is of course very important too and there are several components that you can choose and these are said to be side grades and different ways to play that certain class of ship rather than just a straight upgrade there are trade-offs here where you gain something you will lose something else and it's up to you to configure your ship exactly how you want for whatever mission or role you want to play and the component choices that you have are your primary weapon your left auxiliary your right auxiliary counter measures hole shields and engine i experimented with a few of these but i only had a couple of hours to play the game so i didn't get to try all the things but i think there was over 50 different component options in there so what i've just described in the last four minutes is the essence of the game the core experience here is the cockpit first person view only there's no third person here the cockpit is the centerpiece and managing your ship balancing everything knowing when to attack when to defend knowing when to run that's what you're going to have to master what game modes are there then well i got to play the prologue of the single player campaign it lasted about an hour in total and it's a really simple introduction to the game it's set after return of the jedi and there's some familiar star wars characters in there i don't really want to go into the story much because i don't want to spoil anything but there is a single player campaign there where you play as the new republic and what's left of the empire the multiplayer modes that are available at launch will be dogfight which is essentially team deathmatch in space big map lots of debris things that you can fly in and out of blow each other up first to whatever points will win the match but the signature game mode is definitely fleet battles and this is the bread and butter of the multiplayer i feel and where the core audience who stick with this game will spend most of their time fleet battles will also have a ranking system that will get reset so i expect it to be really competitive think of fleet battles as a grand scale tug of war 5v5 you can play in pvp or co-op new republic versus the empire both teams have flagships you've got a star destroyer on one side of the field and on the other side you've got a mon calamari your ultimate goal as a team is to be the first to destroy the other team's flagship and your ability to do that depends on how much morale your team has at any point in the game so at the top of the screen there is a morale bar and you can increase your team's morale by taking out ai ships or by taking out enemy players or you can get big boosts of morale by destroying raiders and corvettes which are ai controlled gunships which roam around once you've gained enough morale in the first stage you'll then have the opportunity to attack two defensive light cruisers which stand between you and the enemy's flagship if you manage to take those out you'll then be able to go on to the final objective which is the flagship keep in mind at any point in this battle things can flip if you're attacking and the enemy team gets enough morale they could suddenly be attacking your ships and you've got to get back there get on the defensive when it comes to the flagships though it's not just the case of these having a giant health bar and just gotta keep chipping away at it on the star destroyer for example if you get to this stage there are several ways that you can take this down the flagships have subsystems on them that can be disabled or destroyed which leaves them vulnerable and targeting these subsystems is the most efficient way of destroying these massive ships one of these subsystems are the shield generators and those are the big spheres or the golf ball like things right at the top here and then there's the targeting systems here at the top in the middle if you destroy that subsystem then you will significantly reduce the rate of fire and accuracy of the ai turrets that are shooting you out the sky on the star destroyer then there's the power system and this is arguably the most important one to destroy because if you take this out it will reveal vulnerable weak spots on the ship that can be attacked to inflict really heavy damage and if you do take the power system out the flagship will stop burning and there'll be these like electric splits in it and if you attack those that's how you get maximum damage so there's a whole host of stuff going on here if it sounds a bit overwhelming it is honestly once you've played it for a while you get used to it and then you can start doing tactics employing teamwork and you really get to understand the flow of the battle it's a lot of fun and you just know that there's going to be so many meta builds and different team compositions to work best in this game mode and i love the fact that they've got a ranking system in it too it's obviously the mode they've worked the most on wrapping things up hopefully i've explained as well as i can how you play this game and it's giving you an idea of if it's the kind of game that you would want to play too i've only played for a couple of hours but it's obvious that my expectations my assumptions for this game were completely wrong i thought with it being a star wars game it would be a really accessible super arcadey shoot em up in space yeah it's not quite elite dangerous levels but it's a far cry from something like the space combat in battlefront 2. i love the fact that the developers have had a vision for this game and they've stuck to their guns and there's a lot of simulator elements in here that are going to appeal to simulator fans it's got vr support it's got joystick hotas support it's cross-platform i would say too that if you haven't played other simulator games it's not an easy game to pick up ultimately i think that's a good thing because the game is doing what it's set out to do well and it hasn't pulled any punches and it's quite complex and there's a lot of strategy involved here there's a lot of customization options for the player and i'm really interested to see in a year's time when people have mastered the game what those fleet battles will look like what kind of maneuvers will people be able to pull off what loadouts are they using on their ships if i recall correctly they did say there was a spectator mode coming for the game too and on top of this it looks incredible from what i can tell this is new frostbite engine in the single player the character models were really good and they actually had decent facial animations and lip syncing and when you're flying around in the ships the lighting is gorgeous the detail of the cockpit the detail of the other ships the vistas in the background it's a gorgeous game and it also sounds great too i thought i should mention you can turn off the hood completely if you want and all of the instruments in the cockpit that's enough to play the game you can just use the instruments if you want to motive are ticking a lot of boxes here and it's a half price game and they say that there's no mtx in it all the customization that you can get for your ship like the paint jobs and the little trinkets you get the little ewoks and darth vaders that's all just earned from in-game currency so i think there's a lot to like here i do have some reservations about it though i feel like for your average player the average person that picks this up you might play through the single player let's say that's like seven hours long you'll try out the dogfight mode it's fun for a bit but ultimately it is just dog fights in space and to me that will get boring quite quick i prefer objectives and then you've got the signature mode which is fleet battles and i really enjoyed my time playing that and i think it's something that's got a lot of variety but they did say that that's it there's only six multiplayer maps and eight ships in total to choose from so i'm concerned that those people who are playing the game all the time and maining it let's say might get bored of the lack of content after a short while so it would be interesting to see if motive at some point in the future release more multiplayer modes or introduce new ships for this new maps i think it's a necessity based on how the video game industry is at the moment i think people's expectations are that there is just new content all the time will star wars squadrons have enough in there to keep people coming back and is there enough there for the hyper competitive guys to keep playing it i'm not sure but i definitely feel like the core experience is delivering is solid there's a ton of depth there and there's a lot of fun to be had i feel like the people who will enjoy this the most will be those who have four other friends that they can play with and team up as a five in fleet battles communicate with each other use tactics make it a social thing those are my first impressions do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below are you liking the look of the game how do you feel about this one with that said if you enjoyed the video do leave a like that's a great way to support me and if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe if you want to see more and i'll see you in the next one good job
