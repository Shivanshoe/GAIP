ah today i came across a cheater in warzone doing something that i've never seen before and i've played the game a lot it's ridiculous disgusting and it completely destroys the game and it just has to stop surely there's a way to make what happened impossible with that said here's my brew loadout i was using for this match if you'd like to copy it i think it's pretty good and if you enjoyed the video hit that like button below it's a great way to support me and subscribe for more let's take a look right storage town let's go it's gonna be really hot right at the start of the plane there's so many contracts around i'm here for it i don't think i'll get this though oh god hey okay no somehow excuse me please don't beat me to death captain price there's still people around what are you doing and i've got a foul cool you know what i'll put that munitions box down i'm gonna get the ammo it's gonna be great oh someone's doing a recon over there a grenade launcher okay i mean i'm not disappointed in that if only i'd have waited and not use that ammo box so soon i'd have a full grenade launcher i could fly that around have a little check just to be safe [Music] [Applause] oh there's someone in there is he the only one he might be the only one if you're gonna stay in there mate you gone in here no you're in there now you're dead nice try with the c4 though someone else why did they just go prone i don't get it i don't understand someone just drove an attacker over as well cool try again let's have another look are we clear [Applause] oh i'm being hunted where from there ain't nobody around [Applause] i'll just go in the tower there [Applause] not very mobile with this gun am i triple threat now i did run into it it's gonna keep falling back need armor turns out badly wants the cash thank you i think he's chasing me though because his threats stayed the same there's a uav it's always a bit tricky to get out of this area listen i've got to be careful though because i think there's someone next to me i have plates am i going to get shot trying to get these plates i need them i'm going for it and i did silence thank you cool three plates loadout is back in storage you can do this quietly as possible pro tip by the way if you're gonna put a munitions box down drop all your ammo that you want first and then pick it up and then you've got spare ammo there you end up with more that way if you get what i mean do you get what i mean i think you get what i mean there was only one load out here so hopefully there's no one around no one else is going for it we're gonna go brew an mp5 should i drop the nade launcher though now i feel like i should take it could be a good name so the thing is with this bruin you can't really take on people at close range if they've got an mp5 or an mp7 even like an m4 you know sometimes they can just take you out very easily that's the fire station there was a guy in the tower there wasn't there on the drone but are they still gonna be there should i just shoot and see if they move i'm not sure i mean if they're still there that's some dedicated camping going down true dedication i suppose i could check if there's someone in the tower with this oh i don't believe that that is so funny one hit as well oh man i just wasn't expecting that at all but you know it's so low so people don't move oh we only had a little mp7 poor guy if i'd have climbed up there i'd be dead oh look a jeep i need to aim a bit higher up than that dude's got a sniper as well i would take the truck but i don't have a trophy system just drive around see what happens i've got this uh this eagle america skin oh i bought this on the fourth of july there we go there's the sniper yeah yeah yeah and there is a buy over here isn't there but people love to count this building uh self press uav request you get another one can i get through i can right what we're looking at everyone's got ghosts as expected there's only man there's only 13 people left what has happened in this lobby i think i can tank a c4 though right i was a guy there oh no it's me america i don't think he has a c4 otherwise i'd be dead it's really rude i'm just trying to dispense some freedom take my freedom take it i don't think he wants the freedom and it's a bit awkward now so i'm going sorry i didn't mean to please forgive me all right can i jump out here rihanna let's see if we can get this guy he's got ghosts let's go dead silence i think he was like there somewhere wasn't i why is there always a door sound as well when you do dead silence there's a jeep coming here that's the guy from the pool he's dead and the other one's down okay sorry mate they just didn't move did they they just did not move he does have a trophy on it though fair play uh is there a that's a lot of cash i could use this now which is good that trophy system is really useful there's always someone on the edge isn't there every time [Music] oh there's a cluster strike who's done that then are they aiming that at me oh there's another one guys please uh what that's the best shot of that guy's life ever look at the mini map look at the amount of cluster strikes what the hell's going on that was [Applause] [Music] because that was really weird it's right there semtex i'm not sure this is a new spectator for zack because that shot i mean i was like full speed in the jeep driving along and it was a headshot full healthful armor i think that's a cheat look at the mini map again it seems like they've just got unlimited cluster strikes or something i think that guy is a hacker i reckon that shot they took as well was the name but he's got some kind of infinite cluster strike kit this guy is just wall hacking and putting cluster strikes on people he knows are there because they've got infinite cluster strikes what the hell is that that's a really weird hack i sucks that i was killed by a cheer but whatever look at this look at the amount of cluster strikes what is going on god this is awful i can't believe that people can do this you can just spawn cluster strikes if you're chasing can you look he notices that he's just putting the cluster strikes on the enemy players yeah there we go and now we can view the hacker and see what they're doing oh my look at this what is going on here we go look 21 kills that was named i just why are you the way you are that's really disappointing well i think that's a video isn't it that's uh [Music] that's the video let me just show you if you come across the cheetah guys you just go up here sorry up here and then you go recent players and you've just got to find them in the list unfortunately there's no easy way of doing this you can't you can report them when you're spectating them you press x on pc or something else from console you can report them in game but if you don't get them in game this is where you find them so make sure you report them for cheering and then also what you should do is right click and block them because that means if they ever get into a pre-game lobby with you a little message comes up and says someone that you've blocked is in this lobby so you can just leave that lobby so it's a best way to avoid people who are cheating or toxic but with that said i'm gonna leave it there for today guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
