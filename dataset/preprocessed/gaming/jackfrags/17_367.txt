this may very well be the shot that gets me banned on call of duty warzone found myself in the gulag m82 red dot sight push the car he's dead he's gone he's out of the match delayed really happy with that one since the new maps come out i've started to like it a bit more i still think there's a few areas that need improvement though and the lighting is kind of crazy but i am going to do a separate video on the lighting because sometimes it just doesn't make any sense but i have developed an unhealthy obsession with the clapper mode so i've got this in a bundle i don't even know which one it was it was one that was released recently and i just can't stop myself downing people sarcastically clapping in front of them and then executing them it's an addiction i think that's that's what it is it just makes me laugh so much at some point just take that amount away from me please but today i've got some gameplay using the pharah which is quickly becoming the new number one choice for assault rifles although to be fair in this new meta since raven did the huge balance pass to the game i think there's a load of good choices for assault rifles and smgs but the pharah is definitely pushing its way into the top tier now seeing it all the time this is the build that i've gone for and you're gonna see some highlights of it today playing with acolyte and tomographic and we were just having an absolute blast it was very fun plenty of memes plenty of dreams good times all around really also just another reminder for you guys i did release a brand new poster and t-shirt last week it's a limited edition and it will only be available for a couple more weeks link is down below if you want to get it for yourself and it's a ode to the first year of war zone all sorts of easter eggs and references on there some people actually received this today and have been tweeting me pictures and it's looking good man it's a really nice design the artist's title knocked it out the park so if you want to get one time's running out link is below pick it up thank you so let's get into the gameplay now check out the pharah bit of sniping here too i hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like
