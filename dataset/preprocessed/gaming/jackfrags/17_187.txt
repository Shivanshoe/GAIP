you would expect assault rifles to be pretty good in battlefield 2042 given the scale of the game but up until the patch that went live a couple days ago they were pretty terrible thankfully though after that last update they're now viable and actually fun to use with that in mind i thought i'd run you through my loadouts for each of the assault rifles now i've got all the attachments unlocked we're going to take a look at what works what doesn't and what the best setups are to use if you enjoyed the video leave a like let's get into it so we're starting of course with the m5 i'm sure a lot of players will be used to this rifle from the beta it is the starting assault rifle so naturally you'll see a lot of players using it ironically the way that i've got mine set up lends itself more to an smg than an assault rifle first off the sights this is of course personal preference as there are a lot of varying sights in the game but if you've set the gun up for range clearly you're going to want to go with a longer range sight do bear in mind though that some sights reduce ads speed as well so watch out for that with the m5 my go-to is the simple red dot sight i then go for the close combat magazine which actually ends up giving you smg ammo this offers better recoil control reload speed and rate of fire so it's great for close combat i had a cobra grip and the warhawk compensator i tend to choose attachments that reduce horizontal recoils that's the side to side movement rather than vertical just because vertical's a lot easier to control with this build though you are quite limited on range it's definitely a cqc build and you'll notice your damage drop off at range quite a bit so stick to the infantry focused areas of the map and you'll have a lot of fun thanks to the plus system though you can easily swap out a few attachments on the fly to make it better range if you want now moving on to what i think is the current god gun in the game the ak contrary to the m5 this is a different beast entirely and possibly my new favorite gun it's not as easy to use as some of the other weapons in the game so you will have to have some patience and some gun control to get the most out of it but i think that's why it's so rewarding let's talk about attachments before we get into the gun itself i mentioned earlier that some sites reduce your ads speed and for the most part i stayed clear of those on the close range versions but on the ak i did try the uh one smart sight i don't see myself using it long term but i wanted something a bit different to try it's pretty cool because it has a reader on the site telling you how many bullets are left in the mag i'll probably switch this out to a different side though ak works great with the red red.2 and then i'm currently using the standard magazine but i do have the high power rounds on my plus system if i need them i'm using the lwg grip which i think may have some incorrect stat listings on it as on other guns it has a negative impact shown but not on the ak either way this helps improve accuracy when you're not moving and then the warhawk compensator too if you want to use the ak at range though you may want to throw on the long barrel what's good about the ak is that it responds really well to tap firing at range it can feel like a bf3 gun at times so with the gun packing a real punch if you land those tap shots at medium to long range you can actually get some really nice kills and kill streaks up close you'll notice it does have a reasonable amount of recoil but you can control that most of the time if you do find yourself struggling though you could swap out the warhawk compensator for a different muzzle to lower that vertical recoil but try the ak out for a bit level it up once you get used to it honestly it's my goatee right now incredibly fun to use next up is the scar and this is fairly similar to the ak and how it operates fairly high recoil but it packs a punch the scar differs a little as the underbarrel only has a grenade launcher option so you've got to choose between either smokes incendiary or grenades the incendiary can be quite good though keep that in mind there are no attachments available for the underbarrel to help stabilize the gun and you do have to struggle a bit through the early levels at the beginning as you're only offered a 20 round magazine so it can be a bit of a slog stick with it though because this gun is great i use the standard red dot sight but i do have a longer range one on my plus system just in case i need to switch to it sometimes you do i played around with a few different ways of playing this car i tried the high power rounds and the high powered drum mag but i actually found myself using it more as a standard rifle with the standard rounds and the warhawk compensator this gave me a pretty good balance of close fighting and distance if i wanted a gun that worked better at long ranges honestly i'd be sticking with the ak the scar is brilliant for those medium range engagements though i mentioned earlier you have an underslung grenade launcher on the scar and this does give you a bit of flexibility while playing logically for me most of the time i'd put the smoke grenade on it because that just gives you a nice way of blocking off areas when you're trying to get between flags or push up to an objective it does seem to be pretty bugged right now though and the smoke disappears almost instantly after you put it down so my recommendation here would definitely be the incendiary last but certainly not least is the ac42 this one feels amazing it's the final assault rifle unlock and it's by far the most unique i want to warn you though it's a burst fire only gun and burst fire rifles are not for everyone honestly they're not usually my thing either but there's something about the ac42 that just feels so punchy and rewarding when using it because it's a burst fire rifle it was actually still very viable even before the patch and now you'll definitely see a lot more players using this as they get those unlocks i've kept mine as a close range aggressive type of build so go with the standard mags cobra grip and the warhawk compensator bit of a theme here if you want to sit back and use the gun at a distance you can put the high power rounds in and the long barrel but it does kick pretty hard with those longer range scopes which is why i prefer to use it close up two bursts from the gun is usually enough to drop someone and while you're not always going to win fights against other close range guns i don't think you're really meant to with this so sit back at those medium ranges when using it but not too far away so you don't lose that two-shot burst kill that's the strengths here the flip side of this though is that if you miss a burst and die because of it can be really frustrating you've got to time your shots get into the rhythm pick your targets well if you're in a pinch though the firing rate is actually really high spam that mouse one or trigger and you can land multiple bursts incredibly quickly and there we have it at the moment there are only four assault rifles in the game and you could argue that two of them are very similar in the way they play the ak and the scar the m5 is that all around decent starter weapon the ac42 as i mentioned that's the gun that stands out now because of how unique it is that being said at least we can use all four of these guns and be effective with them and enjoy them at the same time the ak is my go-to right now though you'll notice that a lot of the attachments carry across most of the guns too but remember this isn't a definitive way of using each of these guns for all its flaws battlefield does at least let you use a gun in very different scenarios without having to respawn and if you kid out your plus system well you can definitely create two variants of a weapon with those attachments think something like the scar-h or the scar-l one fires slower but packs more of a punch but the other fires a bit faster and has more control i'd love to see dice spend more time in the upcoming patches tweaking the guns individually though the latest patch definitely a step in the right direction but we're not all the way there yet smg's are still incredibly strong and sometimes you'll lose fights at longer ranges than you would normally expect to smg's the pb even though it was nerfed still really strong high damage but try out these rifles with those builds on the new patch see what you think let me know how you get on down in the comments below before we go just a tip as well if you're struggling to unlock weapon attachments you can actually do this now in solo and co-op mode and a lot of people don't know this and they can't figure out how to get to the screen but it's quite simple you just click on all out warfare then click here where it says change game mode go to the top right click solo and co-op change it to breakthrough or conquest you can also pick the map and what difficulty you'd like the bots to be this will allow you to unlock weapon attachments for your guns and also weapon packs and upgrades for your vehicles it's a pretty chill way of doing it really you just kick back shoot some bots and if you want to you can invite up to three friends to do it with you and that's all for today folks thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
