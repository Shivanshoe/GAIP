team down at the compound down here i mean it's finishing on salt mine okay so we're actually oh they're running through the trees here what is now known as big red someone else killed him i got the credit interesting another one there same angle shot from the right i'm encouraging the team from tv that'll be tv team can you tap this yeah keep an eye on it like you keep an eye on it don't
