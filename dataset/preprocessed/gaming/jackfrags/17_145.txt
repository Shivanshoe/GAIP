today we are back on battlefield 4. i haven't played this since august i think last year it's good to hop on again i might have to retrain my brain how to play this game as soon as i've been playing a lot of 2042 recently i don't know why i've chosen to go after this black hawk either oh no they've hit the wall here they all dead there's a man and i just boop you well i did i did the boob but i think i've sacrificed my life and the helicopter [Music] that's a great start to the video man we are losing this game it's zabar though i think this is the full full map isn't it the big dog still looks good this game hey those things are deadly even though it's from twenty they're birds the little player just jumped out and attacked me or something which is a load of birds but yeah we're losing this one [Music] maybe we can make it what are you doing in there oh god i hate those things those loads underneath [Music] i have to kind of tap by don't i as well can't just hold nice one like in 2042 no one else here [Music] there's a giant lav above me there's infantry in this corner as well we're still here hello he's gone over there these guys just running at me i don't think they could see me we're good okay we're gonna capture this now yes i'd love some teammates right now that'd be great send backup and everything no okay fine i'll do it myself it's a grenade someone coming in oh god there's more another one ah the streak is over rfb man that's a call back that was one of the original guns wasn't it at launch i think i don't think i've maybe used that once or twice we've lost all the flags now pain right i'll take this helicopter again then hopefully this time i won't just send it into the ocean i think it's if i go over there it's going to be a isn't there it's bound to be yes there is squish they were on reload okay the guns were on reload oh no oh nice shot abrams got me killed by a teddy bear with a gun and a cape often you see that on the battlefield is it yeah i'm gonna have to play the next map aren't i oh god e i tank back here again that recon's got some kind of uh what was that they have c4 no i've got the wrong load out now see this is where plus system would come in real handy i could just put a scope on this or something old t what is it mk 11 44 tickets let's see how many kills i can get then before the end recon you stopped didn't you i saw you ah the tank it's fine it's it's not fine it's fine okay dream's over next map what's it gonna be guess is in the comments below who knows it's goldman railway then we'll go see the yeti he lives in that mountain over there i think he's quite shy today though i've got a bit of weight to it though this has this helicopter can't wing it around as much as you can with the ones in 2042 i'm gonna shoot you for doing that that was really mean i don't have a gunner though like that guy could have easily killed me that had just come over me in the face with the old attack chopper gunner and i'd be a goner where's that missile come from then ruined no can i get revenge on that tank where is it is it one of these i'm gonna absolutely nail you oh someone else got the kill come on i don't think i even tried flying a jet in 2042 but what people tell me though they're just supposed to be like pretty bad a vehicle so man ruin us okay tank here we go i've just popped his aps i'm gonna come back for you buddy i won't forget oh get off me get off me i'm gonna land this and repair it this will be the first time that i've ever actually landed a frog foot in this game please put it down guys
