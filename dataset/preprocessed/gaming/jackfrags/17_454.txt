difficult though how i got the cables yeah so today the suppressed enfield oh my god please dice come on come on now can't jump over that the last time we played was on sinai desert and we had a pretty chill time to be honest and we were sniping then but today i thought you know what let's get the suppressed enfield see if that works out this map might be all right for actually we've got some sniper friends here down at sea if only i was on the other team there'd be so many stab stabbies right now all right how you doing are you looking at are you looking at me it's rude to stare didn't
