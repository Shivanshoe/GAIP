welcome to battlefield 1942 this is not a joke i reinstalled this and i thought seeing as they're remaking two of the maps in bf2042 in portal we jump back in and just remind ourselves of what an epic game this is and where battlefield all began and this came out in 2002 right i was 16 years old 15 going on 16 when it came out and you can really tell the age of this game if you go to multiplayer click internet unfortunately there's no service up because it was powered by games but i'm sure there must be some kind of unofficial servers a community somewhere that's still running games for this like modded or something but let's look at this down here connection speed oh baby these are your options 56k isdn adsl or if you were one of the big dogs you could get that one meg connection let's go baby now i think i was living at my mom's house when this game came out and i did have my own pc but we had a 56k modem and you had to dial that bad boy up if a phone call came in it'd knock it off if your mom wanted to use the phone you were screwed you'd have to stop playing but i digress now let's take a look so there is a campaign in this game but it's it's not like a traditional single player campaign it's basically dice set up some scenarios on the different levels and you played against bots that was it you got some customization here as well but what you could also do was instant battle this is what we're gonna be looking at today now check it out all the maps in the game do you want hard bots easy bots just normal how many bots do you want 400 all right so the two remade maps announced so far i hope they do more in the future bloody well hope so fingers crossed we've got the battle of the bulge and el alamein and i thought that we'd just load up a map and just show you what this game was like because for its time it really was revolutionary and i spent hours playing this with friends i had a couple mates at school who were the nerdy ones and we had gaming pcs and we would just play this when we were supposed to be doing our homework at the weekends we went to lan parties as well and then eventually when the mod started coming out like desert combat we played the hell out of that but here we go so 400 boss l alamein there's that theme that loading screen though oh nostalgia it's kicking in and these are the classes now dice have said that in bf 2042 portal it will have these classes so for example if we picked anti-tank we're going to spawn at the base here in 10 seconds i don't know how true to this game they're going to stay because anti-tank doesn't have a primary weapon as you're about to see they got a pistol so we've got an m1911 and we've got a knife and a rocket launcher and a grenade and that is it hang on is that what i think it is down there there's a bot going for it though no no no no no no that's mine can't run any faster than this no take it off but please oh it's the flying fortress that is amazing right it's got three seats in it got the pilot with the bombs you've got an a on the top and you've got a under the belly gonna see i think that you can fire down with but check this out man this is 36 versus 28. you can actually do 128 players in bf 1942 i could totally click bait this video couldn't i playing l alameda with 128 players and then just do a thumbnail with the new i wouldn't do that to you guys i'm sorry i can't bring myself to do it but that's the anti-tank class look at the box man they're off doing their thing that one's on the gun this one's just running around it's terence pickles let's go terence oh plane just spawned we're getting in you can actually bomb yourself too if you want just right click drop the bomb kill yourself as soon as you spawn oh my god i mean the planes they handle very differently to modern battlefield games is that a stucker there oh they just crashed or maybe it was a bf109 proper first-person view as well in the plays where should we go down here is that an enemy tank i think it might be now there's absolutely no chance in hell that i'm going to score any bombing runs on any tanks oh my god oh no no no i'm dead wait when way too slow there the planes do stall in this game anyway that's a good opportunity to switch class right what should we do engineer engineers are fun you know why they're fun you get dynamite and you get anti-tank mines it's not a gun here check this out oh that sound though amazing i think it's a bolt action rifle isn't it yeah no proper iron sights either get some ammo there all the vehicles have gone i mean you can really see this map just is a big it's just a big desert this map was great on desert combat though because i had the a10 thunderbolts and all sorts of helicopters and stuff so make the most of that space but you know in the remake i think they're gonna stay true to the overall layout or they should but then they'll probably add some stuff because it's apparent i mean it's a barren wasteland oh no the tank's been destroyed if i recall correctly you can if there's a bot in a tank you can just go up to it and press e and then get in it i could repair this if it's damaged oh are they enemies there yeah i think they are oh my god they're shooting at me guys i don't even remember if it's hit scan or not i don't think it is anyway i need to repair this there's the bar on the left it's done all right we'll jump in oh my god these bots sir bots are just schooling me guys i wanted i wanted the vehicle oh there's a jeep here yes here we go right so you just left click put that on there it does stick kind of and then your plunger comes out and then we're gonna drive this as if that's born there one of the dynamites fell off as well i'll come back for you flying fortress i'll be back hang on this all my dynamite fallen off i can't believe that i thought it used to stick maybe i got it wrong if i put this mine here that doesn't look safe i think this is all got friendly fire on so this will kill me oh my god i think it will kill me let's see yeah we're gonna fly this thing this time let's go oliver get in michael o'brien do you want to get in as well come on michael oh it's terrace pickles and stupid oliver right here we go the big boy take it to the sky that chase cam as well oh that's good i need to pick up some speed maybe i should take off first before i start messing with the cameras how about that i'm going to take that point there there's no way to like aim the bombs either you just have to guess like if i anio's gonna hit yes i think we're gone if i jump out here this is the hang on let me show you this let me just switch seats oh no the bots have jumped out they don't trust me oh god i've ended the b17 i'm so sorry oh it's war here we go tank battle try and get behind it oh my god there's so many enemies here oh no yeah i mean at least it looked cool oh we got a tank here get ahead get around the back yes the sherman we just killed martin rabe and frederick bollock i think they actually the tigers like they're members of staff at dice i don't know that target is going to kill me i think nope i mean i've hit it four times it's smoking i'm only a sherman though he's an ob tank a tiger ah on fire goodbye got some german infantry in front here we oh my god they find a rocket in this yes you dare go put on me but it's like an artillery tank isn't it yes living the dream all right who wrote their base here he's there like am i allowed i think i'm allowed in here aren't i or i can go and steal their planes at least if i wanted to know i'm gonna do that jeep what are you doing yes closing the tank here oh no i think we're going down yeah i'm just phone camping the bot's not going to allow it no sorry shouldn't do it against the rules so the medic was quite a basic class they just had the thompson which still sounds awesome what the hell why did i just blow up wha what did that anyway so they've got the thompson they've got the health kit it's a medic right you know you know how it goes and then the assault i don't think we've played this assault yet have we get the bar grenade so the blr was really good and all these guns have proper iron sights the only one that has a scope is the sniper rifle i think you kind of zoom in here we go here's your classic battlefield recon player even the bots know how to do it just go pro nice leg movement there dude loving that energy all right graham graham's turning slowly towards us he's friendlies yeah that's enemy isn't it over there whoa going for those long range rocket shots there right we'll commandeer this uh bot you're supposed to let me inbot there we go switch seats the bot isn't let me take over this is how skynet started oh my god there's so many on the hill here look at them all don't even know if i can hit them from there honestly i i don't know if the game would even render those projectiles i did that one you can see it does have a better drop on it can i get a kill with the bar before oh my god dude what the hell that artillery tank yes it's so it's so inaccurate so difficult to tell where your bullets are going nice pace dude it's a good job they don't shoot back oh no set them off into a spiral logic zeros and ones oh my god what does it mean oh i'm sorry i don't know at least we're just having a conversation i think good shot joey i'm not bad i don't think he'll hit him with a pistol from there my old buddy i mean they do actually have contextual voice lines if you shoot friendlies actually felt bad about that one oh my god axis just appeared out of nowhere that b.a.r though making like work of them check that out who's that harold meegan yeah we're losing now look they've got the majority so we're losing but they've only got three tickets left so i think we're gonna win either way i'll take this wagon oh my god all right can i run this german soldier over oh my god put that rocket launcher down i've got the panzerfaust oh god i'm so dead they're everywhere it's literally an open desert one more ticket okay that's yeah we just got launched into the air what the hell that was sick i just want to see why that dynamite oh no no guys come on i just want to test why did the dynamite fall out because i'm sure you could stick it on the front i'll just put it inside it i don't know there must have been a trick to it back in the day if i drive that is it going to come out no i think that's staying in there that's the trick isn't it you just have to put it inside it oh no one's come out two's come out stupid oliver it's all gonna fall out oh my god that was awesome bang [Laughter] i kind of want to get some sniper kills just so i can remember what that was like lads lads i'm gonna need to take this vehicle thank you got all these commands as well you could spam the hell out of these used to get really annoying you know a submarine and then you just get a call down if you spell it too much see i thought about that even in 2002 don't be a spammer it's gonna do a bit of damage here watch oh my god it's gone uh right sniping i just simply don't remember there must be bullet drops look at the bot the friendly box going for it but please roadkill yes oh no my mate's dead oh god that's better the sniper's working now oh i just stole my tank oh that was insane advanced day iron i mean you just don't get any feedback on the sniper rifle at all i don't remember it being this bad not like this grenade out grenade out the ragdolls are great i mean that has got some aoe on it let me tell you [Music] the bodies just landed that tank's gonna kill me look at this clean up here this is going in the oh it's going in the montage let's hit the triple i literally just said ouch tank please don't do this today oh my god i'm nearly dead yes come on lads lads what are you doing this is tiger's hanging there oh celery come on oh that's a bad mess spots come on you can do it grenade that will kill me what are you doing this is so intriguing watching the bots do this i guess they're just trying to figure things out mp40 nasty yes the germans of course do have different weapons to the allied forces they don't let me take the things anymore they've learned they're like no mate you're trolling us we know you're a real person but the hell sorry not today there we go gg beat the bots guys unbelievable scenes wow bf 942 what a game i know that's not the real experience because it's 20 21 we're playing against bots but if you weren't conceived early enough that'll give you a rough idea of what it was like anyway thanks for watching guys like the video if you enjoyed it dislike it if you didn't subscribe for more i'll see you next time [Music] you
