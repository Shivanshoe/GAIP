was perfect i think that's it right let's go that'll be it for like this wave nice job guys that was an awesome push i don't even know how you made it across the gap there with all the enemies around no i flashed it i think i just got lucky on the timing yeah here's the part of the map where we've got no idea where anyone is okay so nice how'd that scare the army defending aren't we is this the same map yeah but we're on the other side okay okay it's like we have to push or they push that kind of thing see we can push to see stud yeah oh i see they just didn't even bother before yeah i think he's here covering an insane angle where i basically just can't lose i'm going downstairs are you uh you are pushing in now yeah i'm gonna push i'm gonna do the same but on the right flank wow i got that kill coming down with jack insane i hear him start i think in front [Applause] yeah one nice one grenade watch out careful they're going to be watching for spawn now [Applause] oh dude they just got hosed he's still peaking he's pushing up a little bit he's pushing up a bit but looking on the street you got him there he's getting in yeah pushing him nice one on the point oh you're fully alert now jack yeah that was a good push though that was six thought guy just pushed up close ready oh no that's our artillery be careful you're outside it it's a bit brutal isn't it oh my god that rocket the heli's absolutely rinsing our spoons they're going to be watching this angle now got my rpg out it flies this way it's dead hold on close proper hover over you hit it i think what someone did rpg oh it's um oh come on take it out take it out everyone shoot dude we did it oh it's going down it's going down they're on d though i need to get on the point have we got teammates on it yeah we should

gonna take this opportunity to try and get a c oh my god there's enemies in it are they [Laughter] killer i got three the other three finished me off the hell was that they're running to play around running today running to do oh the coughing is such a giveaway when you have a mask this is chaos man what the hell this is great though this is the reason i'm getting ready to frag it okay [Music]

come on come on come on come on all right got it nice time nice talk okay we have to be quickly if you if you can chain us together i'm right behind you we did it good job imagine trying to cut b have you seen how open that is that's what i mean i mean should we just no i mean i'm capping a behind them i mean i'm next to you you need smoke manage to flank on the point i'm capping geez no cap i'm capping you just need to know all the angles don't you like all the windows oh yeah yeah my knowledge is huge massive yeah the only problem i'm going to have with this mode is because it's going to be very much flanky online whereas when it's a more linear map where you're fighting over you know what i mean where are you on b i've nearly got it below us i can hear one tom oh he killed me is he on b some uh right where i died i don't know if you see that like the staircase that you went out before i went all the way up and he's at the very top of it holding an angle i think they're above me he's above your deck two of them above you directly above you there's a staircase that wraps around near you somewhere oh you get him jack no no he's here got one nice that sounded sick what happened to that okay i think yes geez i'm playing the pog the m99 take a look at this bad boy outside look at this wow wow uh it's like a halo weapon isn't it oh hey you like that guaranteed collateral every
