okay this is the first weekly mission in battlefield 2042 that i've actually cared about because the skin is good and it's for a sniper rifle and it's not that difficult to get you need five ribbons 20 kills and assists with snipers and 50 enemies spotted and spot assist also flashback conquest is on and that's easily my favorite way to play the game at the moment on some of the remade maps here so we're going to dive in let's see how quick that i can unlock this i'm going to play as casper with the proc sense over the spots should i say the rocket launcher as well just in case and then dxr i think that's a good choice right we're in okay let's do this the helicopter i seem to recall if you just deploy this it will spot things for you even if you leave it in the air there we go there's enemy spotted so that's a good start here we go here we go here let's get him get him lads yes kill kill there's an irish here he's dead first sniper kill in the bag helicopter's been destroyed as well nice oh cheeky shot on maria falcao let's get this point i'm gonna throw a sensor grenade out there see if we spot anyone on the back dead all right no other enemies on the point unless they're like at the back there maybe we're good i think we're good we got this i know there's people up here oh love that anyone in the bunker or doesn't look like it what's up four kills okay on the hill i am loving these headshots man this dxr is insane my drone is still there look we're executing the plan does it have battery power is it gonna run out am i gonna have to like charge you up at some point there's a tank most of these okay we can get this can get this we've got lots of anti-armor here is it dead nope there oh i just missed it went off the front come on one more look at itself look at itself gotta time this right out there yes come on i'll convert you diy harry you're back in the game another one that's a ranger there is someone there finally that's the same guy that i saw earlier isn't it oh my goodness a wild cat please i like this these guys have made a little defensive area here got the angel crate off track irish shield very good i think they put an aps as well yeah so that should protect from any incoming projectiles fingers crossed 60 degrees oh that just missed they're like straight in front of it okay balti over there oh man there's two tanks look at this they could easily take that sector if they pushed in because there's barely any cover for the infantry i don't understand what they aren't pushing in there jeep coming yes ow oh the helicopter got me the super hockey should have seen it coming i'll try and take b back maybe get some long-range sniper shots here if we're lucky hello goodbye come on peek again peek again i'll get the res don't worry harry you're back let's go push this objective right here cheeky irish these headshots i'm absolutely living for these headshots anybody there doesn't look like it okay so we'll cap this again nicely successful attack there oh my god [Applause] look at these guys yes love it can we get across the bridge though they're dead in there now let's see the bridge yes i was lucky that guy didn't see me then wow that's 200. can't get the snipe yes oh my god i'm feeling this guys i'm absolutely feeling this we've actually nearly capped all the flags here even though they've had a lot of vehicle dominance like our infantry game has been really good this match is someone in here okay you are not paying attention you are not paying attention at all it's fine you don't have to you know you play however you want to play oh hello come on come on come on oh i thought i was going to clip the tail there i do fancy another shot of that though let me tell you it's coming back up there oh we're getting close i think a couple people jumped out then kiki poke ball over there get the spots okay there's one over there two on the roof oh oh he finished me off well played harry harry okay you got one there's another one harry harry there's another one harry harry [Laughter] i'm sorry you failed hogwarts i think that's actually 20 kills but i didn't get them all with the sniper did i so yeah we'll have to play another round see if we can get it there's no voice lines what have they disabled them maybe it's a portal thing i don't know but i did see a developer talking about changing the tone and some of the voice lines on twitter so maybe they are actually changing them okay one ribbon two ribbon i think we got two ribbons then okay erica harbor how did i do them can i actually see my progress here i click on that hardware appearance there it is missions completed in pre-season week 19. two out of three so i've got to do one more of the missions i'm not sure which one it is though i wonder if it's the spot assist it could be that one they might be the hardest ones to get oh come on mckay you know you want it oh you know you won that mckay you love that god damn i love this map too man it's so cool i'm enemies at the port here gengo neutralized then go neutralized i apologize in advance for that well no i can't apologize in advance for something that i've already done that doesn't make sense but i apologize either way get the drone out come on there we go i think there was quite enough room there hello what's going on down here that's cheeky one there one here am i helping i think i'm actually helping with this that's cool enemies here lads you need to get these oh my god look at this there's a whole squad kill him take him out in the river that's an easy kill upon the bridge someone take him out somebody get him no there's more here there everywhere come on lads right i'll have to do it myself plenty of assists there they're all over here weren't they are you all dead now i feel like they're all dead i'm gonna get my drone and put it here and then i think i can put three on it two three is it all on i think it's all on oh my god i mean i could just use it on infantry right is that scummy one kill i'll take it oh my god that angel just went airborne that was awesome here we go and the explosives on there it is hide here that didn't work okay

joan get some of the c5 on there boom there's three there's you know balti here he's just flipped upside down okay right this is gonna be really mean but i have to oh that's not okay now was already
