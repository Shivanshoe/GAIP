hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're checking out a new game called rogue company and a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video rogue company is a third-person competitive character-based shooter for xbox ps4 switch and pc at the moment it's enclosed beta via paid access but eventually it will be free to play i'd heard good things from a few mates who played it so i thought that it'd be cool to have a look at the game what you're about to see is one of my first games so i'm learning a lot of stuff but i had a bit of fun at the same time genuine first impressions and reactions here and if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below with that said let's get into it enjoy right who should i play phantom saint lancer guys i don't know who should i pick she looks cool a sniper okay let's do it uh what's this it's like we're in a boy band or something that dude looks like arnold schwarzenegger when he was young look at that him he does well a mix between arnold schwarzenegger when he was young and the kid from stranger things the one who works in the ice cream shop remember if you're forgotten his name right uh so what do i buy i can upgrade my pistol could buy an ability i'm gonna upgrade the pistol let's do it what kind of a pistol is this semi-auto i'm not sure right okay so we've got to defend a and b see it looks like i'm going b yeah semi-auto pistol okay what's the ability what does that do is that just smoke oh there's someone there cool we got a kill all right we've got the bomb down i'm sure there was another guy here wasn't there enemy spot yeah first round one oh he did down my teammate there come on kid from stranger things get up right okay so what we got that's the sniper isn't it 8 000 can i get armor or anything become immune to being revealed by enemies why wouldn't you want that it's a bolt action sniper i you know this woman reminds me of if you look at the picture she looks like the girl from blade runner 2049 you know the one i mean the pink one the pink one so i'm assuming there's going to be a sight line here somewhere i missed it chuck that out see what happens there is a head there isn't it come on stand up i know you're right there oh no oh god i'm scared that i'm gonna get pushed it's third person corner peeker isn't it oh wow nice grenade i'm gonna push out nowhere hello dead all enemies have been eliminated round two in the bag let's go quite a cool looking character isn't she now something else you can do is you've got like melee stuff right so if i buy that upgrade my gun i think you can you could throw the axe i could just eat it at someone as a last resort would i get it back though that's the question i don't know this is all new to me and exciting go to a this round dropping in hot so what does the a bomb site look like twitch tv by the way deploying lethal can i get up on this oh yeah check that out youtube oh headshot let's go yeah and there's a guy here that's i can just pick up his gun that's a straight upgrade oh why is he no enemies what happened there someone chucks a grenade something like that you guys play this game all ah my fifth game i guess oh cool well balanced well i've got a grenade there haven't i i don't know what that grenade does we must test it's interesting how you keep all the upgrades round around oh it just threw it straight away yeah that's i didn't mean for that to happen sorry twitch tv by the way they've gone b are they going big try and get behind him here yeah that's b oh dude why am i on fire what's that about what the hell why was i on fire does she have a perk or something that sets you on fire is that a warhead grenade all targets eliminated great work all these things i just don't know what they do i'm enjoying it though it's good fun right we got lots of money as well i mean it's going well so her other gun is a dmr it's like upgrade a grenade that explodes and that one is oh that reveals enemies okay cool i feel like i should have upgraded my sniper there could you just stay up here and snipe you have to jump out the plane i'm not sure but that's their plane there let's go so it looks like i didn't hold on to that guy's pistol that i picked up before that's the one that's a good grenade oh no my teammate's gone down mate i'll get you don't worry thanks man we're being pushed don't we thanks man he's right there [Music] oh i don't know what to do all enemies have been eliminated nice little flank i thought that guy would be waiting for me to be honest what is that magazine that's like the longest magazine in the history of man okay oh look at these upgrades boys let's go let's do it man we're playing well we're doing okay oh that blue force guy's got 10 eliminations 11 downs are we being carried by the stranger things guy maybe we are all right we'll go a this round i'm enjoying this good fun there are three different game modes this is like the premiere competitive game mode i suppose so this would be the the sweatiest so to speak this dude's going on a little flank here they're right there hp on b once again again he's remaining well done steve that's his name steve oh no he doesn't look as much like arnold schwarzenegger attack he looked a bit like kurt russell the guy who's in escape from new york should i switch players i'm going to be a different player could i be steve steve's been taking straight away what about she was setting me on fire wouldn't she this guy talon god i don't know is that okay let's do it is he a melee guy don't worry they'll run when they see me so i suppose oh no he's got guns that's like an old-school world war ii rifle he's got a nice katana that works i can throw that as well yeah so we got to go plant the bomb now which side you want to go see let's keep going gay i i will destruct a yogi okay are they not defending utility out what's that day i've got the objective spam's action i guess they've moved on to arm it i'd like to throw oh no no no are we okay do you want some if i stand in this corner here see if i know it's fast one in there i just hide him in there headshots headshots rolly pollies yes yes bomb defused no way they defused it there was someone on the bomb side the whole time match point let's close this contract didn't realize that
