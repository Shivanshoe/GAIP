i'm just gonna give you a little preview of today's video before we properly get into it this is a shotgun apparently there's a shotgun in the game at the moment with a certain setup that are one hit kill at stupid distances and luckily this week's mission on 2042 lets you use smg's all shotguns for the main part of it we have to get 15 ribbons and 100 melee damage i think that's one melee kill so we're going to jump in test and see exactly how broken this shotgun is and have a laugh with it if you enjoyed the video leave a like below and a comment let's get into it i might try breakthrough because i've not really played that much since i changed it to 64 but i definitely prefer it to the one to eight version okay so this is the build here got this off stod's new video you've got the factory barrel the 2x scope i don't think you need that but that will just help you get those longer shots the flechette rounds that's the important bit and the laser sight there so let's test it out and see exactly how good it is we've already taken a i've just been messing around doing my intro and stuff oh look at my ranger should we go up here range will company won't it i think so anyone up here that's a bit too far away maybe uh maybe not sorry did that just happen you can actually like headshot people with it i feel like you have to lead a little bit there's a little dozer there look at that that's cute a bit of that dozer like that did you is that even gonna reach well sniper there you can hit people from there oh okay right this is uh this is something then this is actually a thing that does is still there he was there now he's been eviscerated by my rocket launcher it is what it is i have to remember to try and get that melee kill as well so i can do the weekly mission thing oh that was cool little grab there i just see someone there yes i did [Laughter] ranger please what are you wait what were you firing that ranger there's an enemy there yes okay right that's this is unacceptable behavior we talked about this we can't be camping oh they've got a spawn beacon oh no thank god for that let's see if there's spawn here come on you know you want it take the bait please oh they actually did another one i'm gonna see how many i can get another one is that the same player aldris i don't know cheeky reload that'll do very nice they made that a bit bigger didn't they it looks like they did it used to be a lot smaller than that oh no he's killed it no hey don't snipe me i'm the sniper with the rocket launcher and the shotgun that's a ribbon that'll do there's a guy over here somewhere on the map oh hello i don't think so buddy got a shotgun going for a little flank there sandrina not today we're going to go a long way to that objective don't we really i think that's 11 kills isn't it so far i've been counting feels like 11. i've got no rockets left damn it is there people here somebody in here isn't there i saw them on the mini map where did they go let's go all the way up i mean that's a bit silly isn't it it's a little bit silly i think i can hear people underneath me pretty sure i can anyway oh there's one yes just line up those headshots very nice go over here somewhere as well down there it didn't let me put my shoe that's embarrassing we got it we did it oh there you are it's just a two-tap how far away was that like what 35 40 meters maybe somebody here we're trying to get the melee kill is that 100 damage yeah that counted look look at this up wait there's still someone there there we go and someone here look you don't even really need to aim you can just hit fire see you on the radar that's a one-hit kill that's a one-hit kill what oh man okay this kind of reminds me of the bf3 slugs before they fix them that's what this feels like it's not quite as good maybe i don't know if you put a sniper scope on it i don't think you could be sniping people across the map like you could with those things but maybe maybe maybe there's a chance is that a head there it is but i can't quite see it damn it what if i shoot a rocket there no splash okay this is literally the last point here isn't it all right let's try and get on the objective and make some pain what the hell's happening here look at this whoa what you're really gonna res me when i'm on fire did we get it i think we got it okay pretty good i think that shotgun is pretty effective at range maybe a bit too effective you know what i'm gonna go on this poor thing and we can look at exactly how effective it is i think that could be kind of interesting okay so i've just loaded into a portal experience here created by no name so credit to them for putting this together and it just spawns ai when you hit them if you look in the bottom left it shows you how much damage that was and that was like a what a foot shot and it just killed them in one but i've been testing a few things just now check this out okay so that ai is 20 meters away we'll go for a chest shot dead right so it's a one-hit kill within 20 meters what about 30 meters looks a bit far for a shotgun doesn't it not for this build and this is exactly the same build that i was just using in that game now what about 40 meters that guy there 40 meters away not a one-hit kill but let's mark this guy let's do 39 meters what do you reckon one hit kill it's a one-hit kill so basically anything below 40 meters with this build will be a one-hit kill which is why it's so ridiculous but i think all of the flechettes have to hit anyway i'm gonna go jump into another game now and test it out some more okay so attacking on kaleidoscope it should be interesting because there's a bit of distance here okay nice little triple head start that's not bad is it i go for a rose on this guy i feel like i should who killed you am i gonna die doing this i don't know i'm gonna go for it anyway it's fine don't worry you're back in the game hello dude that was rude trying to rock it at me like that yeah that's a one-hit kill don't really care about your smg did i just get the weekly mission done then i think i did okay b1 could be phone for the shotgun because it's so close quarters not that you need to be close with this watch out watch out i can do a bit of damage to that you know let's go just put me in coach put me in hey guys oh did he just roadkill someone what the hell oh no he put us in the drink nice nice pretty far away that one this is so weird is this supposed to be an art installation or something i don't know okay so maybe if they've got armor it isn't a one-hit kill you can well you can kind of shoot it when you're jumping as well what the hell is that about look at that i'm really enjoying this this is good fun gtm av here nothing wrong with a bit of vehicle gameplay we're going to copper c4 though got to be careful there buddy is it dead i think it's dead cheeky little p i love that i'm gonna try and land on that condor or at least put some c4 on it okay i disabled it but does that actually matter i think i needed another c4 on it didn't i i was just going for that yeah i think it's a bit too high now all right let's test out this shotgun some more because in this last interior bit that'd be really good i missed that one i see people on the radar here grenade there and then there do you have a move i love that love that oh no good shot i've got a res i'm in the fire please dice i mean what could i do more grenades required no yes yeah oh that didn't kill what happened there that looked like a direct shot to the face close range as well come on medics i'm right here yes legends i've got three shots someone here we're gonna get it last point hey we did it that was a good laugh there we go that's the flechette shotgun try it out for yourself good fun anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed the vid leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye you
