hello everyone and welcome to watchdogs legion so i've been given early access to the game and i thought that i would stream the first couple hours of the game on pc and see how it is i have played the game a couple of times in different preview builds but i've never tried it from the start so i'm looking forward to this it's open world london some interesting things going on here and today we are playing in 4k so that option is available there for you also we're going to have ray tracing turned on so we should have some nice reflections as we're looking around london and with that said we're going to start a new campaign here get stuck in i hope you guys like this if you do hit that like button below sit back relax and enjoy let's do this [Music] ah london what a town history around every corner and a tourist photographing it pub serving up a pint and a smile all that music theater and art and multiculturalism and the world's oldest underground the tube the class of cities really top shelf stuff only took 12 000 years to build it up and one night to tear it all down [Music] what's our status perimeter security's down but plenty of your flying friends about okay now dalton no time to waste yes ma'am i'm in any idea what we're up against badly if you hadn't brushed off i might ever consider leaving these security threats to the authorities that's rich bagley the government would sooner arrest us for trying to help and actually do something useful let us saw this one on our own carefully dalton hadley are you detecting a little worrying sabine's voice brilliant asking the computer about feelings this explains so much shut it you two and get to work there she is all right we are in in the parliament oh cheeky tape down right there that hurt you more than it hurt me all right let's try and be stealthy about this quiet dalton if they don't shoot me i won't shoot them how's that seems like a fair deal someone in there and there's my access point i think i've got to get over there a bad guy here oh wrecked this dude is a ninja got another bad guy up there and distract i think yeah there we go and go for the take down oh that is sneaky one more dude here stealth master let's go so this is the box i think that i need to unlock here they've got loads of dead set gear down here and why'd you suppose that is what how did they get their hands on it i don't know but someone wants to make it look like dead set was here [ __ ] you need to proceed with extreme caution dalton crack on fire these men in black anyway nothing identifying i suspect that's by design this dude's a very spy type character isn't it [ __ ] me the entire place is wreaked a blow jesus those canisters badly is that rdx nitrogen enough to level parliament can you locate a detonator badly not exactly but there's a device streaming a [ __ ] load of encrypted data from the floor above you yeah that fits the bill on my way bagley is that not the detonator no but it's a transmission signal to a device on the floor above us safe to assume the detonator we're looking for that's gonna hurt is there anything i can do with these guys is that dude gonna come over here you didn't see anything brutal right hello it's ninja time ruined right we made it i've staged dead set propaganda all around the bombs these pricks are going to blow up parliament and hang it on us not if you get to that detonator first so they're trying to pin this on us i guess it's very guy fawkes isn't it interesting start to the game reminds me of kingsman this dude suave right in the house of commons whoever these men in black are they've got bollocks to set up in the center of government this is where they have the debates it's so weird they've modeled this really nicely that looks dangerous i found the detonator and it's definitely live badly i'm gonna need some help with this yes you are but sadly i'm locked out [ __ ] well we don't have a chance without bagley wait i might know a workaround we trained in manual overrides at mi5 you're full of surprises oh he's mi5 be quick about it all right bagley do your thing i'm in and the bombs have just armed themselves well that may complicate matters [ __ ] sake can you defuse them or not of course i can but i might also trip another failsafe and vaporize you so fair warning expect this to draw some attention your way dalton dalton we've got some heat here at hq how long is this going to take badly depends how often you interrupt me with questions all right everyone faces on guns out hey masking up it's about to get real [ __ ] these dudes are stacked check this out they're on me i'll try and hold them off i'm masking up could be anywhere right now see that trap all right i'm gonna take him out tell me you're close i'm through security now wading through terabytes of decoy code looking for the destination sequence badly update let's just say how many other guns that's annoyed by how sophisticated i do i've got a mp5 that's cool for security is still working oh that was close i've got this weird mind thing as well i think that's like a an electric trap oh yeah look at that nice defuse the bombs bagley i think bag looks like an ai or something not sure there's any more there [Music] it doesn't look like it let's get this ammo i think we're clear problem dalton i need your physical appendages now i can help with that what's wrong there are three slots on the left one of them is the receiver you need to pull the controller wire are you [ __ ] kidding me no i'm [ __ ] not pull the wire if this gets me blown up bombs diffused see that wasn't so bad was it badly you bastard you nearly gave me a bloody heart attack then whoa whoa whoa what the [ __ ] am i looking at it appears parliament is not the only target more bombs are going live as we speak on screen rightly now we need to get the word out it's true sites need to be evacuated they're spread out all over london there isn't any time but my sister's at the tone conference we have to do something i picked up a transmitter on the roof that is sending out a signal to the other bomb sites if you can reach it i can shut you all down sabine [ __ ] dalton we're breached go the roof all right i'm gonna have to fight my way out all right let's get a move on sabine what's going on we're being raided it's a bloodbath a protocol is to wipe everything including badly i need him for the transmitter and hijack that i know but if they get him they get everything names opt locations okay i'll do it the old-fashioned way wipe him yes wipe me do it sabine and get the hell out of there [Applause] i think that should give me access back is down you're right [Music] these guys are really kidding up can i throw my thing all the way down there what was that scream some nice lighting here isn't it check it out beautiful right now i was told that i have to turn music off at this point otherwise i'm going to be ruined by copyright stuff so we'll turn that off and then we will continue all right see we can get on the roof get up there mr spy efforts let's go okay okay okay oh my god now you ruined no well done dalton wolf i'm impressed oh that's cool the [ __ ] are you oh you still think you're here to save london i'm afraid that's not going to happen you're here to help us with some important work important work killing thousands exactly to save the world you do know londoners have died before the plague the great fire the blitz is not much fun but destruction is always the cure and it begins today zero day it's time for a hard reset oh my god [Music] oh damn a series of explosions devastated three sites in london authorities are asking residents to remain in their homes as the situation continues to develop we have received no official casualty total but it is expected mourners gathered for a series of candlelight vigils that brought closure to thousands of families and indeed to an entire city london is now laser focused you have to pay respects downing street where nigel cass ceo of private military company albion received a mandate to secure london cass has vowed to hunt down dedsec the terrorist group response display of force albion used cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems and autonomous drones to capture the remaining members of dedsec a stark warning to would-be insurgents are posting record profits due to increased efficiencies in production and distribution enabled by the use of technologies initially developed and approved for security what's the amazon drones as crime numbers take a dive illegal gambling drug trafficking and prostitution all down following prosecutions of the leaders of four of london's five largest criminal syndicates the streets of camden and brixton that's definitely by the government life finally begins to return to normal curfews and travel restrictions have been lifted in all boroughs thanks to the deployments reports fake news have been greatly exaggerated possibly by foreign meddlers pushing a false narrative through social media albion is in complete control of a few reprimand the public about the circulation of fake news conspiracy theories persisting in dark corners of the internet that terrorist group dedsec were framed for the bombings have been roundly rejected our own reporters could not find a single londoner willing to expound those theories on camera the facts simply do not support any other story [Music] i need to assemble a team but i can't reboot deadset alone let me break into london ctos and see who's available i love her voice so good i recognize it from somewhere are we gonna get a little spider but our way i'm claire waters and we've been discussing the hacktivist now alleged terrorist group yeah let's go on this week's buccaneer radio i have colin calling in colin what's your take hi colin now i've been saving the start we should have read that dead sick and throwing them in jail now i'll say they should all be lined up and shut you don't find it awfully convenient that they've been fingered as the attackers but we've seen no proof this little guy in the hospital in the past few months than dedsec ever has i smell a scapegoat now i have emily calling in emily what's your take you're absolutely right claire the government's just framing because they want to make it seem like they have this under control they probably have no clue who was behind the bombings but that doesn't look good on the news does it dead sex being a thorn in their side who better to pin it on angie i have you next what do you mean it's terrifying to think we harbored such a dangerous enemy oh my god the blinds look at this terrace at the top of the tower do you find dead set more frightening than the different gangs in london like playing kelly kelly might set your shop on fire and maybe they'd kill you but even they wouldn't try to blow up all of parliament oh that's cool do you feel safe for using a pseudonym everyone should it's a shard why make it easier for them and now we've seen what they're capable of far they're willing to go hold on that's kind of cool do you mean the government are you suggesting the government was responsible for the bombings oh trust me claire they didn't do it alone we're right the top of that tower that's impressive spider climbed all the way up [ __ ] situation is worse than i thought ah but there's a candidate looks like you're dead sex best hope me all right okay so now i get to choose football player i mean there's a lot of options here isn't there so these guys have got perks that guy comes with a pistol this dude's got a police contact with shorter team arrest time okay he can summon a drone take less damage i do look swap full auto smg all right reality tv star judith pincus is that real name banned for life from london zoo what did she do podcaster she kneeled an albion god oh she need an albion guard in the groin oh that dude's got like a sick motorcycle nikki underwood where's the mp5 i kind of want the mp5 that might be a good starting thing to have con face okay game is rated 18. why did she just say that why that's not that's not a way to greet someone is it right okay [Music] all right mate we're in glad to see you're alive if you're still committed to the cause dedsec needs you here's london send you the coordinates to our last safe house meet me there fine whatever fine whatever you just got a weird voice right um so we need to go here oh nice it's a fast car watch out so the cool thing about this game is that it is quite accurate to london i don't live in london but i've been a few times and i recognize quite a few areas of it like this is uh chinatown here i think but because this is the future they've got a holographic dragon in the sky i could try and recruit a granny let's see some of that ray trace thing oh yeah look at that we're living in the future anyways i'm sure we'll be back here at some point not a big old bus it's a shiny bus hey look there's me it is kind of a focused mix with the civic rights you're correct it's a cool looking car yeah i recognize like so many of these places this trafalgar square yeah i think so although it is a bit different now there's protests and all sorts no freedom no future it's a ton of detail there isn't there here's big ben in the background looking good hopefully they're finished working on it already no more scaffolding by the looks of it [Music] it's cool remember democracy i'm amber [Music] i've got to try and not get in trouble with albion or the police is this is this hyde park here [Music] i think so you excuse me i mean this is i know this is highly illegal but i just want to show the people watching you know take a trip around the park excuse me lads watch out i'll get back on the road [Music] okay we made it to our destination here those are checkpoints i reckon i think i'm gonna go in that pub i downloaded a patch to your optics so you can access our security system it's set up so that i can't just let someone who isn't dead set in you will have to do the manual override right so if i get past this manual override does that make me dead sick hello puzzles remember i think that means we're in one of sabine's area can i have a pipe please downstairs later then yeah fine i remember the last time what else is in there right the way it started to rain right away like it knew so i'm soaked but my keys my phone everything is inside what can i do but give me your money what now excuse me bye bye [ __ ] this is it isn't it oh so this is dead sex underground base i think oh it is the underground as well yo someone here oh [ __ ] there's no power coming up in today's episode of the upload we're talking about how bagley managed to conquer london oh that's the ai i mean that mannequin is happy to see me it's the underground if hijacked an underground station oh it's a bit dark in here powering up no deadset registration detected identify yourself or i'll seal the exits hack your optic and read you every drunken email you ever wrote until you starve no brother you've got a problem take out sabine she sent me sabine's alive well that's one piece of good news i'm bagley deadsex definitely not stolen highly advanced ai assistant and it seems i've been out of commission for a few months anyway why don't you go connect me to the deadset network so i can become more powerful than you could possibly imagine i mean catch up on what i missed i feel like they've modulated the character's voice because there's so many characters in the game and what they're doing is they're modulating it to try and make it sound different it's good but her voice sounds a bit off i think coming up today on the up coming up today well they got a a pipe puller there hello so many collectibles already let's get you back online bagley i've got pig mask ah that's it i'm reconnected to the network downloading our database news archives oh oh oh no terrorist group deadset responsible for deadly bombings in london dalton wolfe dead i'll leave you people alone for a second and you immediately [ __ ] it all up so tell me bagley if deadset wasn't behind them bombings then who was there's a gap in my memory after dalton well let's be honest after i disarmed the bomb of parliament i'm missing information about what happened after i was taken offline but from what i can infer an unknown hacker group identified only at zero day was involved i believe this zero day staged the attacks and framed deadset for their dirty work come to my terminal sabine is requesting a video call sabine this is a lady with a nice voice i like i like the voice i recognize it but i don't know where it's from patching in sabine brent now this is suggest you listen very closely to anything she has to say there you are i'm glad you made it backly god it's good to hear your demented little voice is your memory intact not even slightly the last record i have is of our hq being raided my only lead is a group known as zero day ring any bells no but the hq was attacked by some men in black the same that were at parliament may be working together we didn't stand a chance they just gunned everyone down gunned down [ __ ] how'd you make it out i managed to escape through the sewers to camden a contact smuggled me out of the city and i've been hiding out in the north since prudent your profile is red flagged as a high priority target in the city surveillance system even a partial recognition here would have you hunted down and shot on site they're doing a proper crackdown on dead sake here listen i'm on your side yeah believe me but i don't want to get got no i mean listen if anyone knows anything about risks it's me i lost everything and everyone but it comes down to this london is in a death spiral and if deadset can't pull it out trust me no one can the city needs a resistance and it starts with you hmm what do you say i say let's resist bruh excellent registered welcome to dead sec [Laughter] now it would be irresponsible of us to release you naked and muelling into the wild yes it will find equipment around the safe house that are essential items in your deadset kit right what did we get checkpoints checkpoints can be found throughout london use them to purchase tech upgrades gadgets and weapons purchase tech in the tech menu to obtain and upgrade gadgets weapons and hacks equipping tech to change an opportunity's weapon or gadget use the edit function in the team menu purchase tech is available to all operatives okay so what should we get right so these are some upgrades i don't have much available to me at the moment i've got the spider bot an ar cloak augmented reality camouflage a virtuous mission oh this a chase drone chase thrown hack i feel like the cloak will be quite overpowered because that's invisibility right if you need to you need to get from a to b or that's uh what is that and is it like a less than lethal pistol i don't know anyway i want the invisibility okay edit operative loadout gadget all right here we go am i just invisible to cameras or people as well i don't know your identity from facial recognition tech it's called a mask and while we're here perhaps we can talk about updating your wardrobe i mean look at you come on wow dude outerwear those where you can change that's the one i just picked up in it that's kind of sick i'll go with that one although that's got a skull on it i kind of i'm into school so we'll go with that so i don't know if this stuff costs real money or something or can you just get it with the stuff that you earn in game i don't know hats it's kind of cool you've got all these fancy new toys but it's also important to know the basics you need to learn how to throw a punch and how to take one albion will escalate if you come at them with a gun and shoot you down we want to avoid collateral damage in dead sec we try to use guns only as a last resort have you already met connie robinson she owns the pub contact not to mention a champion amateur boxer go to the practice ring and she'll show you how to stop flinching when someone [ __ ] a punch at you why is there just a dead person here is that person supposed to be there oh i don't are you okay ma'am ma'am can i i don't know all right we're gonna get in a fight oh here we go you're getting it you want some yes nice one for a couple of jabs you want to get in under my block find the weak point e to guard break ruined i like how she's just taking this just it's fine on your feet now you want to create distance counter attack oh my goodness better myself that's uh [Music] why is this random woman just a complete ninja wow ruined right okay use everything that i learned oh yeah that counter attack is like super strong finish finish i don't know if that was necessary that's rap she just knows taekwondo it's fine don't worry about it no big deal it's a game kung fu panda maybe this lady still here why are you here what happened she doesn't have a name or anything just random dead person i don't understand surely that's not supposed to be there oh there's some people here now all right mate right gear in order know enough not to punch yourself in the face or get shot for pulling out a gun too early brilliant i'm working out how we find zero day and ruin their day but i need someone with actual legs to do the legwork hope you're ready we have some damage control if we want to change the perception that we're a bunch of violent thugs i'll let you be the judge of how best to handle yourself but remember you represent deadset now got it all right we're going back up to the street let's go the electro fist i mean that's the upgrade that i want surely she's passed out drunk it's landon maybe andrew maybe so i can just recruit people sabine how the [ __ ] do we even begin make no mistake london is under occupation armed mercenaries patrol our streets allegedly to keep people safe but really they're keeping the people scared no [ __ ] albion stays in power if everyone's scared of being rounded up or [ __ ] shot so we have to ignite the will to resist in the people of london by showing them that albion aren't the solution they're the problem for that we'll need information i'm pushing two sets of coordinates to your optic cheers badly i've identified two opportunities one we're going to disrupt some albion propaganda remind the people it's not albion's way or the highway two we need intel about albion operations if we want to throw a spanner in their plans yeah i'm game brilliant let's get the people of london on board right bare knuckle league where's that on the map building a resistance group requires operatives with specialized skills technical abilities firearms handling and physical training are all valuable bare knuckle boxing rings are a good place to find people who are good at throwing punches each opponent in an arena you'll have an opportunity to face its best fighter prove your physical superiority and they may consider joining dedsec i'm guessing that some sort of primate society thing so i've got to beat gotta go beat someone up okay right so they're on the map now acquire albion's operation data should we go over there unlock some more of the map here can i hijack a bus oh it's a self-driving bus there's no driver it's the future i mean it's quite slow it's got the turning circle [Music] over 600 year old tortoise but i'll take it this bus is out of service at the moment guys sorry oh i can shoot as well put that going away i don't want to attract any unwanted attention here i am driving on the incorrect side of the road for london oh no i don't like that turning circle that's not the one oh here we go it's tower bridge [Music] oh there's the thames sorry it's a problem i'm an absolute [ __ ] aren't i just ruining everyone's day coming through lads oh ruined but watch out for those bridges though there might be one that i can't fit under oh i've just murdered them sorry ruined oh look at this drone hopefully you didn't see me hand brake turn you could probably topple this thing go over couldn't you westminster bridge yeah that's the one all right so we've got to get in here i think ray tracing look it's the future although you can see my mp5 which is i don't actually have my mp5 out peculiar that's a nice oh that's it's got to be an audi right or a fake audi i've got to get up there the royal courts of justice i kind of want to check out this stealth thing that i've got doesn't look like there's anyone around restricted areas press v to scout albion have established an operational base in the royal court of justice oh [ __ ] bro so now albion can nick anyone they like and get the courts to put them away for as long as they want what kind of justice is that exactly but it likely means there's information here about how albion are targeting dissenters we need that data if we're going to disrupt that operation i needed to be behind okay you want to go let's go a massive shotgun oh my god in the groin what was that about well i think i've got to unlock that he's shooting at me up there i oh okay here's invisibility look at this heading to last night that's super oh my god that wasn't necessary that's super overpowered you want some i'll give it yeah she came running down the stairs with a shotgun i think there's another one yeah down there it's a will stone raider parcel fox it just disappeared right is that okay i think that's unlocked now so we can go up there number one time for some disruption got it all right now we gotta go ruin the albion propaganda if i jump up this am i dead a list of what albion consider high-value targets that are threats to the peaceful running of london all right put it away a journalist and this one runs a is still community shelter your doors what the [ __ ] all suspected of sowing rebellion or exhibiting tendencies towards albion is systematically arresting people even before they rise up jokes on them this list can actually help us find like-minded allies willing to help us well done now that's propaganda it's like excuse me i'm trying to get in i want to get in this car let me in i think it's a driverless taxi oh no please don't don't slowly kill me okay this is the future where ai take over and murder us all oh it's like a james bond car oh that's quick [Music] sorry oh you walked into that one lady watch out oh you walked into that one as well oh my god i wasn't going for you i promise you want some [Music] this thing is quick slides around those corners lady oh you've done you've done yourself in how they do it i can rescue them i don't know what this does but i'm doing it thank you thank you so much oh the police are after me now i climb that big crane that'd be cool wouldn't it can you not drive like a normal person you don't drive like normal people in in a game like this dude come on let's be honest the bus saved my ass there i think if i drive through there it's going to clock me i'll take the side alley instead that's a bit like a slummy area here target is long gone yep you missed over and out cool oh sober by camden isn't it yeah it's an ambulance some interesting artwork here reminds me of back to the future right so we got to get up there how would we get up there can i use that thing yeah maybe uh oh up periscope noise why they why would you put paul to why would you put portals up that high sam fisher let's go oh we got points here excuse me move he's quite nimble isn't she to the authorities nice the city of london is actively tracking and searching for dangerous wanted individuals all citizens have an important role to play act consider yourself i can control the vehicles that'll get people's attention let them know someone is standing up to albion like the sparks that they can stand up too if nothing else it'll relieve their eyes straight oh no oh dear i'm sorry there's no proof it was me we're already seeing results from what you've done that list we found named a journalist in camden who's been investigating albion we reached out and he's got information that can help us i think you should meet with him give me the location assassin's creed now uh right i did get some some stuff can i just switch to these whenever i want that guy's got an ak a grenade launcher fast hacking this dude's got a silenced mp5 i don't why do i have access to all these players this guy suppressed mp5 that sounds pretty dope so that just switch so i'm just going to leave her on the roof i think she can just stay there to dead tech fam we're getting smarter faster and mudder every day bang in hype to expose the bastards in charge yeah sick sick sick bruv this dude's got like a holographic what what even is that i always press the wrong button uh map okay oh we're not that far away from camden you didn't see nothing [Music] oh this car does not handle the same as the other ones i suppose they're all electric aren't they yeah this car's a bit slippy oh my god they're pretty good at getting out of the way apart from him [Music] ruined ruined is my favorite word today [Music] right it's me with this dude it's a nice looking area all right mate what do you want uh do you need some help what's up you're the crew that's been sticking it to albion can't believe someone else is thought of as alone right not doing much just putting the word out but you taking action mate what else can we do i'm not gonna sit and watch while this city burns albion's got to go but they're not leaving without a good ass kicking what's your intel then almost got clip finding this all of albion's operational data for the entire city surveillance targets assets it's all there thinking you can make a use of that that's a goddamn truth here's a sample albion's close king's cross to the public right what people don't know is they're using it as their logistics center materials troops whatever a lot of it runs through there you want to give the people a huge boost hit that place put it out of commission and you'll severely hamstring albion's operations here in camden hell everywhere that's the plan then all right that's a glorious beard man i've never seen a beer like that in real life king's cross you know what let's just get on the eurostar and go to disneyland paris so i think this is your typical combustion engine albion's operational plans are just what we needed to really get some traction we'll have to take a close look at this now how do we take king's cross offline power starbucks in there output must be immense you cause a power surge in that base and boom yeah boom that's right there behind me and how do you know this mate that's not the kind of intel you can find online it costs me a third strike okay maybe three but it's worth it if this comes off right it's worth it mate it was right here how did i see it i thought there might be an entrance over there but there's not that's what here mate it's getting [Music] we're in where is tesla bangtan i don't think tesla are in this game generator ain't going to be easy they've locked out tighter since i last saw what do i do my news drones are still in here they should be functional you can use one of them probably have better luck piloting it too yeah i've got a hacker drone have i hi jack hi well causing a power surge in a hybrid power amazing sound like making it toasty we're going to need detailed specifications we need to dig into this disturbance no just no no no no are you seeing this cool looks bloody complicated news he's got a pretty functional camera what a picture do you bagley it would indeed according to this there's an override code that'll get us into the generator system better get closer i like that light that's kind of cool illegal no it's drone warfare leave me alone that's it use the code on the generator and i can trigger a power surge it should be an upstate just killed me sabotage is generated it's fine there's drones everywhere here we go jeez almost blinded me [Music] we got a gold mine of information out of some pancreas albion convoys informants gear you name it everything we need to ignite the people of london like we did in camden derail albion's operations and give the people a reason to rise up bhara by the more we do that the more we'll get allies flocking to the course we'll show london that deadsec is here for them [Music] oh cool that was off the chain mate i think deadset weren't the bad guys albion was saying now the rest of camden will too thanks thanks now that you've shown the borough what deretech is really all about they're gonna be focused the depth of field effect is a bit broken there a way to fight back in fact there's one in particular i suspect we'll contact you very soon i happen to know they're championing it a bit we welcome all types mate gonna need everyone on board to unfuck london yes mate yes we will bora uprising complete borah activities to increase dead sex support londoners in defiant boroughs are more willing to join dedsec skilled recruits uh look at all these guns what well [ __ ] me you're still alive i always have been a tenor not only that but your resistance handiwork just opened up a whole new source of information so now i spy with my hypothetical eye something interesting at the ministry of civic management no rest for the wicked what's up the signals intelligence response service or sirs or the old grey gustavo have developed a surveillance technology called ar reconstruction it's the leading edge of privacy rights violation and thus it could be very useful in our attempts to find zero day well where are we headed to the ar tech that's a bit of a banksy there isn't it check that out i call this gun head doesn't reflect my halo whatever it is you can just troll all the ai right i want this it's what i wanted earlier [Music] oh it's an ambulance i'm sorry i smashed it up yo this is quick what the hell [Music] i suppose with it being uh electric car yeah just instant acceleration you run it you all running guys you it's your own fault can i just get in here oh this is a restricted area isn't it i'm here in theory the ar reconstruction should allow me to use various sources of surveillance data to rebuild past events access a data relay and i can scrape all the metadata for this area so i've got to disable this box temporarily stabilized [Music] that's it now let's take this autocratic quick dream for a test drive hmm what are you doing buddy oh my god it's brutal no i'm gonna get spied data reconstruction in progress cool wouldn't mind the home version no i mean for research purposes you're right we definitely need this extremely cool thing i want for investigating zero day [ __ ] for some reason i can't close it to our servers all right access the network here and let's see if we can't find out where to nick one no problem mate it's a network yeah over here i've got a few tech points maybe i should spend them gadget so i think my yeah it's universal isn't it i've got a few extra ones here lower enemies towards the hacked explosive disable the drones turret hacks ct drone hacks prevent them from taking damage why would you want to do that a spider bot okay i'm down for that located the ctos hub be mindful of your surroundings the sirs has deployed this technology at their hq and i've just nabbed their manual on how to set up the system now scarpa you can't steal their toy if they throw you in the gulag the gulag go on they literally just got someone in the sound booth to go some kind of a secret around here is that a pedestrian i don't know i can't tell if i'm just killing random people uh anyway right bye but no one's just gonna hand over this ar tech right bags the program is hosted on a server that's on the roof of sirs hq all you have to do is grab the whole thing then take it to a few high-density locations so i could recalibrate it to the deadset network and clone my own version hold on the server's on the roof you've got a plan i hope we need to find someone with access to a cargo or construction drone that can fly it off of there perfect opportunity to recruit a heavy lifter to the cause i'd say so you've got any idea where i can find someone like that a heavy lifter with a construction drone a construction site taking caps on shall we now who in london would have access to a construction drone could it be a construction worker wow not helping not so hard was it there's an active construction yard nearby i dare say you'll probably be able to find a construction worker to recruit sports cars sorry mate you've got plenty of money it's mine now [Music] this is fast is this adding a bit of ambiance for you guys or you don't like it [Music] oh watch out watch out randy orton slithering [Music] here's some construction workers profile people oh they have a beastly drone friend i mean the person looks efficient too all right they look promising occupation check drone check this could be the one oh they have a beastly drone friend i mean that dude's got a nail gun too we'll go for that one oh we make you want to join deadstick how would you feel about changing the state of things [ __ ] are you saying you're dead tech i could really use your help i mean can't guarantee anything but we'll try what's up well i'm [ __ ] stupid is the main thing i had a medical issue that of course our completely guided nhs doesn't cover so i went to clan kelly and long story short now i'm a slave do me a solitary slave right right i'll set things in motion recruit josh butter all right kelly will bleed our new friend drive if we don't do something this particular construction site has a money laundering front for a kelly chapter out of camden market any record of the death would be stored there acknowledged you've got to wipe away the death save the girl wipe away the dead how far away is that i'll grab a car take one of these taxis shall we oh it might need a taxi there was a lot more electric taxis in london recently oh cool [Music] last time i was in london i uh hopped in an electric taxi very spacious [Music] a lot newer as well than your typical black cab oh this is a complete curly takeover when do they get this organized oh big you're looking for a terminal or some kind of device that clank kelly would have stored the debt records [Music] i raised the blackmail uh i think i might just stick with the this dude can i just hack that i can hear a drone hijack that camera it's all the way is it over here somewhere they've taken over camden market and attract someone to go there right you're gonna raise all record of their debt putting our new friend back into the black and more importantly out of clan kelly's reach brilliant erase out range i mean it's right there isn't it i suppose i have to go in there myself hmm let's have a look where did it go went over there somewhere goes in there okay i could try the spider bot maybe just throw it over is there a way in huh try around the other side pick that interesting up interesting it's going to be so much fun well can the market has uh certainly taken a turn for the world your every move might make you feel like you're living in a city-shaped prison what's bad news for society is good news for dedsec you can have those lovely little buggers and use them to scout ahead [Music] oh okay he's just gonna shoot them it's fine there's nothing to say i could just go sicko mode here just murder everyone i feel like i should i've got this uh takedown thief oh that's a perk i say he just not noticed me at all he's suppressed though so we're done no that's the wrong i'm one there's another guy back here ruined starting to get a bit closer so how would i get in here there's a there's a line over here and that goes up to the top what the hell [Music] climb up here maybe the climbing's a bit janky come on this is not what i signed up for apparently you can't get up there this area is being recorded fine isn't it there we go yeah this dude's kind of overpowered with this mp5 i'm not gonna lie what the hell what are you doing are they just fighting each other why okay the [ __ ] has gone yes yeah you just have to shoot it is that it okay i suppose that's one way of doing it all right we can actually get this now that we're here a raise can't wait to play as john wick how did you get the outfit anthony it was just in my inventory i don't know i think it's because of the code that they've given me transfer complete got it you've been erased there's nothing you can do now can i like [Music] [Applause] go backwards kill that woman kill kill oh my god kill kill kill whoa whoa what are you doing kill is that a gun no it's not all right we're out there yeah camden market is not looking good man it kind of ruined it it's fine they'll never know it was me right so that's him recruited because we erased his that that you're on about get problems kelly you don't owe clan kelly a thing no more slaving away right wait a minute you don't see my terrorists at all did the state control media lie to me but seriously thank you i know it's gonna sound crazy you know but i think you fit right in with dead sec yeah yeah all right [ __ ] it what's that noise oh that's random can't drive this barge no apparently not right where are we going to go to next oh going all the way down here connie's pub fast travel unavailable when under pursuit oh i've lost the target no one is pursuing me they just said they lost a target please dice i'm not under pursuit oh it's that blue bar i think go away blue bar control we're returning to we're returning to base control no big deal right that's trouble dead sure there's more of those mannequins oh there she is oh my god look at her soulless eyes get that link i see you blow me all right he's at the pub okay joey i'm still waiting outside dice in stockholm where are you uh i'm not there mate sorry yeah i thought this would put me on the street that'd be good wouldn't it rather than inside the underground station is there a john wick outfit or character dino no but you can play as people who kind of look like parliament to approve the use of lethal force for albion contractors ceo nigel cass had this to say dead sec terrorists will quickly find that albion unlike the police force of this city is battle tested and proven in the field the prime minister's office has called this shoot to kill mandate a drastic but necessary rough time to start here your new gear cheers mate take it guess this is a moment of truth here it feels like signing up means kissing my normal life goodbye you thinking straight albion has government sanctioned shoot to kill rights yeah i know it's a hellscape i'm not blind to that just let me say goodbye to everything i care about yeah i know it's terrifying but i'd rather be out fighting the [ __ ] who are hurting my friends [Applause] put it in you here mate go on yeah you're right let's go welcome to the resistance right we need his cargo bot we just used him basically that's what happened there i'll give you the speech later right now we need you and your big strong drone friend to get on top of srs hq and steal a server think you can handle that right going now get out there get out there get the [ __ ] out oh my god so rude [Music] that will never get old i swear it will never get old [Music] oh god all right let's normal don't worry climb onto the cargo drone to steal the server wake up okay she's dressing like the 80s as if the 80s were a person right why is the arrow going that way when the drone's over here to fight hey hey hey hey you're live lads calm down you can't just punch random people in the street mobilizing the suspect you're free you're free to go lady [Music] why's he got like a medieval helmet oh it's the uh it's the london the guards isn't it they wear that right how am i gonna get this i gotta climb up there do i [Music] my suit returned into hq search terminated oh okay right we're gonna have to go in here aren't we what was that i had the option there to do something with that hijack disable the tree betrayal yeah i can't just climb in there i assume that i can open this door by going in here does this give me access no i mean it looks like the kind of place that would give me access doesn't it hey open up don't know how to get that open i assume some kind of upgrade unless i can just climb on this and jump over no i'm stuck alvin will protect you back in the park oh i can just use that can't i interesting yeah yeah okay i can just float on this uh hi jack there we go jump on that oil leds right now we're flying over london oh i could drop bombs on people can i just crush this guy [Laughter] [Applause] smash it's the most overpowered thing in the game all right okay so i've got to pick it up with this attach the there we go oh my god are we going across the thames just your average day in london yeah no big deal that's the millennium bridge isn't it is that what it's called something like that oh just stealing the server easy all right server's loaded up i suppose you go from here oh and um don't blow up don't blow up i passed my driving test for flying colors don't blow up only blow up if you can't blow up data reconstruction in progress this will do remain in the area until i've downloaded enough data to the server it is a bit green goblin isn't it ron download complete i need a wider sample of data so i'm pushing you the coordinates to a new location [Music] all right we're gonna take this over here this is brilliant look at this it's compiling data from the surveillance infrastructure nearby ctos drones civilian optics cctv and then it assembles those scraps into what happened in this location 24 hours ago fantastic magic it's batman isn't it the world's greatest detective oh that's a heavy corner oh i'm sorry i hope they've got insurance for that move out the way and you're dead come on i think i'm dragging the body along oh no i'm sorry i'm not sorry all right so they went over here what's that it's a camera ctos are data reconstruction in progress all right scraping data from optics ctos cameras microphones laptops say do you reckon srs uses this to watch people shag [ __ ] hell do they use it for anything about watching people shag uh bagley we have company well [ __ ] can you do anything to lose your new friends maybe invite them to a pottery night or overshare something personal whatever you do just get to the last location in one piece jesus all right fine transfer complete i'm missing one last data set pushing you the coordinates to the location now coming through why did you just stand in front of it [Music] why i've got some nice lighting effects here shadows i've been here so many times in real life i don't drive like this though i promise just in video games i wonder if you could recruit the queen [Music] you reckon there'll be a quest to re recruit the queen and the royal family miss william prince harry i can see it happening i can see him doing it that'd be a perfect youtube video wouldn't it i recruited the queen in watch dogs legion that's at least a million views i reckon oh this is over by leicester square isn't it regent street piccadilly circus or that lot oh [Music] sorry that's slowly falling down lamppost i love it ct lopez are data reconstruction in progress they're still on me don't let the drones destroy the server before i'm done what is that a dive bomb select an enemy to be dive bombed get out of the lorry and take care of them shoot them throw rocks at them destroy them psychologically with cyber bullying just keep them busy until the transfer is complete taking too much damage a few more hits and it's toast you oh dear what else do i have got my invisibility viral hacking kind of like that dive bomb that's cool [Music] area is being recorded by the gbb can we not [Music] stop recording i want to use a dive bomb again ruined it's kind of overpowered that you can just like oh that's not i didn't mean to do that i should probably wipe out prince off it anyway go on i'll unload the cpus to cause a power spike and destroy the battery unit the electromagnetic pulse should destroy both the server and the drones so you know run you know run oh okay emp blast that's not ideal well that was fun wasn't it being pulled up for heist made life a bit harder for the tyrants of the world and most importantly i got a new toy to play with now run along back to the safe house sabine wants you and your new teammates for a briefing team briefing isn't it all right appreciate it that's just crass nothing to say nothing to say oh how dare you how very dare you i need that now no no no let's go faster must go faster must go faster it's in jurassic park it's like that i think i was like one second away from dying there suspect has crossed the checkpoint over whoa oh this is where all the nice shops are the disney stores around here any sign of the target anyone like that that's piccadilly isn't it they are not messing around like what like this [Music] is that enough of an intervention for you [Music] control put out an apw target is gone wow okay it's fine it's fine no one's died yet no big deal [Music] talk to me close shave right there boys close shave it is a fast car isn't it damon yeah okay cut scene with all the crew let's go well done team it's good to see the safe house filling up again the only way we're going to keep london from falling into total oppression is by rebuilding the resistance we need to recruit train build back our arsenal the people are itching to rise up and take their city back we just need to show them that dedsec are fighting along with them i'm in i want to take on the profiteers exploiting london for their own gain yeah yeah and what about albion then they've got the city on total [ __ ] lockdown and they've caged us in it yeah and there's clan kelly running all the crime and [ __ ] and i'll be on what left a [ __ ] finger fair but remember that this zero day hacker group is still out there they took out dead sex once and it's a good bet they'll try again i believe they were responsible for the bombings and framed dead sec with your help i plan to get to the bottom of this mystery i'd say that's a full docket enough talk let's unfuck london how many f-bombs has there been in this game so far if you're watching this afterwards there's a video someone count and leave it down in the comments below watch the f-bomb count that goes to the uh the boxing ring doesn't it i found a lead that may help us unravel more about zero day and the bombings we ate [ __ ] for i've picked up an encrypted signal from the tone conference site that's been broadcasting on a loop since the night of the bombing go investigate you might even get to try out that fancy new ar tech we stole i mean creatively shared kind of sounds like three clicks philip doesn't it crazy eyes asked is it a co-op campaign i don't think so crazy eyes as far as i know it's single player only everyone went there i saw it with my own two hours she walked away i can just recruit this person i need to get a granny don't i excuse me but you seem like the kind of person who really cares and wants to make a difference what how could you tell oh my days i could put a good word in for you fam that is sick do you want to help me take on clan kelly go on cool yeah gangster's been going around stealing from the mom and pop shops and the ends i ain't down with that it's all cryptos so i can hack the funds back but only if i have the gangster's private key get me so maybe deadset can help you find that key yeah blood you get me that [ __ ] and i can take back everything those [ __ ] stole do me a solid and i'll repay you sometime all right we'll look into it right here so i can just recruit that dude if i want and recruit anyone are we going over here islington and hackney city of london surf walk lambeth nine elms so we've got camden that's unlock did get some tech points as well you can upgrade these upgrade complete can't really afford anything at the moment get that these are my team i'm going to switch to this dude soon as he's got a grenade launcher edmund thank you for the 10. it's very kind i appreciate that grandma baggins yeah perhaps you joining us is totally awesome welcome to dedsec thank you i'm ready for action brilliant what that voice man thank you that's 1200 meters away i feel like i should just uh test this though for a laughs well that's fun anyway let's not get him killed straight away suspect is unsighted unsighted sweeping area i'm sorry i'm right here with a grenade launcher oh okay [Applause] oh that was some fast and furious stuff right there [Applause] get off me whoa suspect's over get in the thames get in the thames it won't let me jump over guys all i want to do is get in the thames we're in the thames i'm terminating the search backwards give me that sailboat forwards right come to me oh that's it keep going keep going that's it all right now stay there the guy's like what the hell is going on i'm just gonna obtain this vessel no big deal can you let me on this is sparta is it oh yeah okay explosion and there we go [Laughter] [Laughter] yeah we can't have music i make my own music that's the best pirate i've ever seen explosion and off the boat okay if i get a copyright strike for that i'm gonna be mad seeing the aftermath of the bombing thinking about everyone who died yeah so why does it look like the bad guys left from a spy phone i'm just saying there's a lot of security for a repair job excellent point bagley let's get this done what am i looking for any kind of device or component that could still be emitting the signal it seems to be coming from within the rubble so hang on if i switch to if i switch to the construction guy i should be able to just get in there shouldn't i oh what am i just miles away now please no come on come on come on now come on that's right there it's fine so i should just blend in oh no oh oh oh that's fine avoid getting close to guards or running all right bit hitman now isn't it oh let's go a bit swagger on me didn't i it's just me uh how did that raise suspicion i'm sorry he's got a massive shotgun whenever you fall for a split second it raises suspicion it's a spiderbot leg hmm what's this what the hell this is it the signal is coming from this spiderbot fragment no indication yet who it belongs to oh poor little guy what are you doing here friend difficult to say but with an ar reconstruction we may be able to see what happened to it and if it relates to the attack access data relays in the vicinity and i can compile enough data to build the ar reconstruction build a reconstruction no don't spot me it's fine all right perfect two more data relays to go i think that one is above me yeah ruined must be up here just just walking around the construction site that's all trying to fix things no biggie one more data relay and i'll have it oh we'll die to read i don't have it get distracted ah what stop looking at that stuff on your phone then i do have my invisibility as well i need it i think it's in here right at the back i can't believe this i think that woman over there was a bit suspicious of me it's fine [Music] that should do it now i'll just take the audio from this stream and the video from these 36 and got it go back to where you found that spiderbot and i'll show you the ar reconstruction from the night of the explosion got it copy that there's some points in here but i don't know how you would get to them not sure eat alright spider what was down here wasn't it is this on pc yeah it is i'm playing on pc are data reconstruction in progress [Music] you bought the payload [ __ ] think we'd go back to you don't trust the kenny dog kelly like clan kelly mobsters blew the city up not their style probably a handoff most likely the kellys were a supplier question is who were they meeting with didn't seem like they knew each other too well maybe that was zero day well don't just stand there keep looking [Music] what we're looking for i'm completely invisible and take down okay how do i analyze it he just told me to go back here but i can't do anything [Music] nice up here bagley can you do a thing and work out who was running the spider ball i've now fully decrypted the signal the spiderbot is broadcasting and while i cannot identify a specific user it is a call code used by the metropolitan police service you what the feds were watching this [ __ ] go down the government are in on it the reconstruction continues behind that problem cool lucky i bought my sql quantum tunneling device mate quantum tunnel technology is at least 10 years away but spider box and drones are here today you could try one of those if you don't feel like waiting good cool there's a spider bite over here in it [Music] there's a vent here that we can use i guess i could go in here i like the animation on that it's cool i'm sure in the first watch dogs game there were like giant spider tanks that you could use i remember why don't you weigh in those human eyeballs of yours at the very end [Music] rdx nitrogen and the exact same detonator system like the bombs that were planted at parliament it's zero day it's gotta be there hurry you've got all the deliveries so you're hired to prepare all the targets oh stop it we're all on need to know [ __ ] so zero day was using a bunch of groups to pull off the bombings that's certainly one way to pull off a massive coordinated attack while remaining anonymous zero day needed manpower and resources but they needed them at an arm's length and it doesn't take the world's greatest ai detective to see that both clan kelly and albion benefited in the aftermath what the hell we'll find adding you to the collection unfortunately this is the most we can get out of the ar reconstruction but if we could find the mystery officer who was spying through the spider bot maybe they could tell us more tell me more tell me more right let's get out of there i don't want to use this nail gun should be all right just to get out though because they don't suspect me aiden pierce is actually in this game i don't know how you get to play as in though just chilling just kicked him in the butt right we got in and out without being detected tracing the spiderbot's serial number it was assigned to new scotland yard three years ago perhaps more information about its user or its assignment will be available at the station so the police knew about the bombings and said nothing and bagley i think we might get to uncover a conspiracy the only way to know for sure is to investigate new scotland yard that's moonlight sonata isn't it [Music] it's cool [Music] completely silent when you cut the engine it's a world war one memorial [ __ ] it looks like albion took over the police station and the entire police service but don't worry if you're not pleased with your privatized goon squad just take your business across the street well i do say [ __ ] you please i also say [ __ ] albion hmm what to make of this no don't worry the only difference now is the uniform assault weapons and the fact they're motivated by profit over public service now any record or information on the spiderbot will be further in let's see if we can find it badly is this the right spiderbot according to the serial numbers this matches the piece of spiderbot from the tone bombing site can you tell who used it last navigate the spiderbot from out of that room i'll need a direct connection in order to learn more from our bisected friend piss easy i got this is there a camera that we could use i can't quite get it there oh wow okay i'm right underneath here oh no look at this it's all fried up right get comfy this spiderweb might be broken and missing some of its legs but it can still jump and fit through vents that's a good way to get through the station undetected reminds me of half-life that's a part of the remote detonator system from parliament if the met or albion rather actually analyzed it they would see it wasn't dead sex handiwork at all this is weird [Music] come on dice we can do it that's dalton's mask it must have been recovered from parliament it might be the only thing left of him now oh right yeah that's the guy that we controlled at the start the motors are all broken up i assume i've gotta get high up here it's really confusing though because there's reflections everywhere yeah it's a bit of a jump puzzle it's different gameplay it's weird you walk you press forward and it just strafes randomly to the left and right hmm i kind of feel bad for it you look at all this junk you'll have to jump your way across to get to the next bent opening oh we missed it evie you like the little grunt it makes when it jumps it's adorable oh just made it the broken spider bot that could alright we're through first person activate that's why it is in pain isn't it who decided they couldn't be trusted to do their jobs suddenly some corporation could clean up our streets better than the same police force as long as captain crime is on the streets yeah didn't think i was gonna make that one you're almost there make your way through this last bent path nearly made it where are we dropping boys you found a friend right dude get out of here now got it scanning spy button accessing its internal drives while i'm analyzing this data you should make yourself scarce unless you'd like to explain to your new heavily armed privatized police force why you've broken into the station sure i haven't broken in anywhere it's fine isn't it the spiderbot fragment you found has a satellite-based gps module that regularly pushed its location to a specific ground station a secret location cool what are we waiting for let's go pushing near the ground station's coordinates he's running to people i feel like i just want to go over to the the wheel we'll finish this mission then we'll go over to the wheel [Music] this guy's voice is so annoying [Music] what if you can ride it yeah this is uh if this is real life obviously not right now but this would be busy this would be packed full of people that's a mcdonald's i think in real life and this is an aquarium it's a sea life center i think i can just play footy kick up tutorial what why all right let's just say this is physical coordination training i'll keep track of your score well what's important is that we all learn a lesson the footy mini game i missed between phase off oh no it changed these skills born with these skills i don't get i don't get it anyway so this is aquarium in real life and it is an aquarium in the video game but you um you enter down here in real life i think you don't remember you having to go up the stairs it's a little mini game in it pigeons i remember these from before seagulls not pigeons it's the same mistake i made last time oh they're stormzy storms is in the game i just want to see if i can ride this you can can i make it go faster hey look there's me go faster go faster i guess you could like get a sniper rifle out right and just get to the top i just want to see the view from the top it's a very accurate representation of london in terms of the layout i think if you're someone that lives in the uk or someone that lives in london and has been there a lot you you're playing this game you're driving around and you're always like oh yeah that's that place and i don't know i feel like if you if you lived in london you'd be just like okay right i don't need to put my marker down on the map because i just know how to get there peak gameplay right here yeah well especially when i get right to the top then we can look at the vistas apparently i can take a photograph big ben that's the bt tower i think can you see mi5 that's the shard although in this it's the albion tower there'd be more planes in the sky as well because the heathrow unless they just stopped flying planes in this particular universe no you should be able to see planes i went right at the top not entirely convinced by that sky box over there london's just surrounded by hills and trees apparently right now let me get out maybe more rain as well yeah nice view mate right uh okay what just happened oh it just teleports you to the ground does it that's weird um all right we'll do one we'll just finish off this mission i do want to play as this dude though and test out that ak in the grenade launcher again congratulations you're the chosen one copy that that's just harassment and i call my horse horse are you a horse knockout punches okay she might be worth recruiting at some point shoot the teammate show short team injury time [Music] uh right missions down here gotta get to the ground station sounds like a trump beer what the hell it's the tx the thx intro sorry misjudged that [Music] so how do we get it sounded surveillance a space under this bridge if you can patch into it perhaps you can take a look inside the gps history of the spider what we recovered regularly pinged these coordinates our mystery witness to the real bombers must have come to this lovely damp location several times no one would come here accidentally that's for sure a perfect place to plan a terrorist attack or to discreetly dump a body into the thames hmm [Music] i don't know how you open those up maybe i'm missing a skill or something destroying us okay right so we've got to destroy that there we go and now we know gameplay mechanics well looks like a rogue cop set up shot down here well if albion was stomping all over your workplace you'd find a different place to store your lunch too and it seems our mystery officer was dedicated i wonder what led them to the tone bombing the computer's dusty enough to kill an asthmatic but there may still be something useful on it are those supposed to be fingerprints it's got a case this is inspector caitlin lao well former inspector now since albion's coup the met is no more the police brass had already buried the evidence anyway everything implicating albion and clan kelly in the bombings but i know mary kelly's band of [ __ ] were involved and they're involved in other crimes we can look into me and a few good mates are willing to go off book going after mary kelly again i'll never [ __ ] learn will i vladiel have to recruit a bloody police officer download the youtube video inspector caitlyn lau video log plan kelly and i'll be on a team on screen some deal i don't have all the details but it looks to be human trafficking the european processing center is the albion angle since the bombings they can grab anyone off the street call them illegal immigrants potential dead sec insurgents whatever though we know who the real danger is so clan kelly gets hold of these people these immigrants deportees victims really and they're taking them somewhere but where and why it all comes back to the boss lady herself i knew she was into something but she wriggled off the hook there's only one way i can do this 24 7 surveillance on mary kelly [Music] if i'm caught well this will be my last entry but i have to see what she's hiding so our mystery officer was inspector caitlin now it sounds like mary kelly was her white whale and her investigation led her to the bombings so albion was working with clan kelly gangsters i can't even sound surprised it seems like zero days web covers all of the unsavory bits of london tug on a thread and it leads back to them clan kelly and albion included we need to do something about these kidnappings inspector lao mentioned albion is running their part of the operation out of the epc detectives like us call that a lead right so i think we're going to leave it there for today guys i do just want to show you guys because i know some people are asked what graphic settings i'm running on here um so we're playing at 4k we've got the fps lock to 60 and you do have quite a few options in here so we're mostly on high and very high we have ray tracing turned on as well and dlss unbalanced but i just wanted to see if i put these on ultra like what does that actually does that make much of a difference so the ray tracing is on the max setting now this albion clan kelly business leaves a bad taste in my mouth and if caitlyn lies right then this little nugget jumps to the front of the queue we have it's just a bit more detailed on the reflections may still be alive but missing inside the epc angel lopez not london-born but i won't hold that against him unlike some others looks like angel got caught up in the immigration roundup which ironically may be the only reason he escaped zero days deadset purge anti-immigrant sentiment has grown in london since the bombings albion fuels it it allows them to send anyone they want to their brutal refugee camp you need to find angel before they discover [Music] this is kind of personal finding history should we see how many stars we can get just shed some light on the obvious fan kelly connection see if like helicopters come after us already right well if he's in the epc won't be going anywhere anytime soon but considering the state of that place we should see what we can do i've sent the details to your device the timestar contact of the egc they can get you inside send help oh my god that's me out of yeah the fps is uh definitely a lot lower now a lot of recall on that [Music] some bigger drones now coming after me slightly different guys i can't hack that really chunky you can hack a little one still how would i get one more start i don't know what can i do just keep killing people i'm not sure oh my god i think i'm gonna die here create too much chaos i wanna know what happens when you get five stars neutralizing hostiles just create chaos whoa okay they're coming after me now [Music] the double team kill me arrested i don't think he's arrested he's been murdered uh we couldn't quite get to five star it must be maybe later on in the game or something well that's what happens when you turn rtx up to max you got to be careful anyway guys thank
