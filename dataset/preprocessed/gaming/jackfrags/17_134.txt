hi everyone and welcome to rainbow six extraction today going to be playing through the campaign with johnny and tommy graphic we'll be going through all the missions it's gonna be pretty chill i think we'll be live for the next three hours 45 minutes maybe four hours depending on how long it takes and i'm looking forward to this i have played a little bit of this already but i've not played all the way through each mission so it's going to be interesting also i do have 10 game codes full game codes to give away on pc on the epic game store a big thanks to them for sponsoring today's stream and video if you guys pick up this game or any other game on the epic game store do consider using my code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that but we'll be dropping the codes in the chat i'll just say okay we're gonna put a code in and then it'll be there and then it's just first come first serve [Music] playing on pc today um i think i've maxed out on ultra settings as well so it should look really good 1440p pretty sure everything's maxed out there and we're going to get into it thank you for coming along guys hope you enjoy this let's do it all right you boys ready now tom you said there's a megalodon somewhere oh yes there is a mechanic is megalodons i mean what we talking here how big um well have you have you seen a mega done in real life before uh i saw the documentary the meg with jason statham does that count right um the documentary you said yeah it's a documentary isn't it yeah yeah it is uh-huh it's a bit smaller than that jack the megalodon is yeah okay just a bit more than that yeah we'll see right so first mission is monolith gardens moderate cautious severe should we go moderate to start with do you see how we fare yeah let's do it i'd lock him up new york city yeah johnny's um only played the training mission even that was a a light skin he died seven times trying to do it so these are randomized objectives right every time i think correct jack correct biopsy serial scan nest tracking and we do one of them and then we can choose to continue or we can choose to extract yeah are these wait what what it's one per level right um one objective per level i think there's like modifiers as well and stuff yeah there's three zones you go into but is that all three in one area yeah all three in one area okay but you can choose to extract whenever you want oh cool um so we playing that i'm going i'm gonna shrek you're playing slack that's the closest thing to your medic i mean oh he's got the weird american scottish accent doesn't it let me show these arcanes how i ground in pounds donkey who should i play as vigil's good virgil vigil i'll play virgil then right okay you play virgin yeah i'll play as virgil i'm gonna put stun grenades on just bought those [Music] that's quite the outfit johnny that is a nice outfit thank you i styled myself i can tell is this like a story cut scene or just an intro just an intro three seconds activate take down the target those tissue samples and they keep saying they're on to something all i know johnny why have you instantly gone prone target is nearby that's all we know but locate and take down targets make sure you shoot all the nests as well yeah johnny where have you gone he's behind you literally beside you like i thought i saw you run over there i've seen things man i mean my chat are already saying don't put the suppressor on why is it less damages than me damage yeah i can hear things okay right we need i've got it guys i've got it great yes you're on your own do we have to do a take down on it let's take down targets yeah okay well anyone got a stun grenade or find it you get behind it tom there it is take it out yes okay i've been greeted with an egg sample acquired all right johnny you've got another one there johnny you need to stop going probe don't see that hole in the wall jack okay right for him i'm taking contact here i'm trying to get behind it there we go that's it yep watch out get the next one and there's one more somewhere i love the shotguns for this game it's just so good i mean they're actually decent at range aren't they so just like making your own little doors like this is so good that guy's calling for backup i don't think tom cares about stealth at all he's bang bang bang shotgun jack i mean i've got to get up in there grill kill the nests there you go johnny you know you can shoot this stuff as well [Music] oh that actually killed me what happened tom one of the explosive grunts just ran into me and uh blew up from behind i guess you have to go for the head for the grunts jack because otherwise they explode when you shoot the back do you mean the little the boys with the big egg stuck on yeah i didn't even realize you could kill them by shooting them in the head yeah yeah every enemy has a weak spot of its own but the obviously the fastest way to eliminate them is just shoot them on the back but when they get up close like that okay well you didn't shoot me there did you i was i was waiting for you to do something okay so that's the objective done so now we go next i think we're pretty i mean you guys are almost ruined for help well absolutely i haven't been here once the way up there got it let's get to the uh next johnny is playing finger so we've got the boosted health at least yeah i think that revives as well johnny if we go down something like that right yeah that's footsteps above us that's right let's just get to the uh the airlock and we can move on to the next bit oh [Music] the gas there's nothing there there was a bit of green in there okay locate the catalyst emitter let's do stealthy okay bang if you press tab you can see our objectives but the serial scan is what we're doing now right yeah but we can't see it on there yet because we've not found it no we have to find um find the ghouls oh no i didn't kill him shot the gas thing at the very end there you go see that was the headshot i love that you've already you got to be careful yeah not like that all right let's start this up back up there nice there's that ability there everyone needs it got a spiker guy there dead oh uh yeah we have to get on this area don't worry i'm gonna put armor down oh do i have armor no i don't no did you make me invisible vigil makes you invisible to the enemies for a short period of time oh boy please come out of nowhere our guy was gonna shoot them oh no resin thank you please come to the wall okay nice so this is just like a domination capture point pretty much the more of us on the other quicker remember oh yeah you can reinforce just leave that one there's like flash bangs spores on the ground here as well yeah if they get on you you have to melee don't you mellow your friends ghostly apparitions up here and leave them below such a nice effect um all right it's a little uh we could barricade a little bit here no not really there's not much here is there i'll close this door though explodey lads are not the one almost there how much you behind nice all right i'm over do you need that here i've got plenty for now yeah watch out johnny watch out gas cloud come in [Music] third time's the charm i think if i go down one more time that's it right can you hold it a little longer than hold on yeah johnny remember your thing your ability as well you can use it's not too long we need to stand on this otherwise we're going to lose owning us from a distance i need to use my impact grenades more are they he's armored that guy okay them creeping around us okay another one's dead i really need help i got the end nearly done nice enough i shot it it didn't actually go off that was nice i'm looking for health yeah okay if you press tab as well it shows you how many supply cases are left so there's one hell thing in this area one ammo there's a box down there somewhere oh nice i've seen that before what's this ability my ability is already full so no if you one of you guys want to come and get this no no i'm playing a sledge got a passive one all right let's move on to the next uh do you want to extract now no no we should go for the next one but we should try and find the health because there's one health thing here somewhere well it might be in the extraction point right oh yeah that's a good point actually got is there next to me oh man there's so many here what the hell moving through that hole there found the health you found it yeah it's live a little bit longer cool okay extractions down here and the nests just like appear out of nowhere yeah they grow in the uh swarm or what is it there yeah it's called swarm isn't it i think [Music] some spores find you jack okay uh ability here maybe johnny take that look at all my stuns okay good job all right sneak and plant trackers are the next objective we've got to be stealthy [Music] yeah it just cuts the timer down that's all [Music] set the auto trackers okay so you have to press v on these right oh no hold after plan otherwise you'll kill him it's like a kids play room there three or five done already yeah don't take down on these guys got one behind me as well you gotta be careful like if you alert too many you can't do the objective interesting so you've gotta try and stay stealthy uh i got killed by spiker i'm out right we're gonna have to pick you up now i am a cheeto jack i don't want you to be a cheater get them to the extraction pod johnny you've got enemies around you no i'm good at the minute let's go ahead for the extraction oh okay we need to get tomorrow though oh he's got me ozzy yeah maybe i'm getting all the aggro at the moment man come on downstairs having a shotgun you have to get really close to the enemy and they can just deck you and want it you've already done that one haven't you johnny's pretty surrounded here i'm coming hold on pollock shoot those nests as well johnny at the top well we have to leave we need two oh johnny can you whack me come on melee me can you whack me this one okay that's a load as well they were all alerted here this one looks angry too let's go is that one alert i don't know oh so you have to yeah we'll fail the objective it's aggroed like that one's the map expands more to the left so yeah if we just get tomorrow out first plop me in there get that expanding photo off here johnny you're a giant cheater nothing yeah can you cancel that extraction johnny how do i do that uh walk off the point i guess i don't know is that gonna i'm gonna screw it so i pressed the f on the first thing as well it was the wrong thing i think we just have to go johnny because you didn't stand on the extraction platform what broke with me it murdered you operate at m.i.a can you not cancel the extraction did you have any other questions johnny i think when i got near it it said press f on this someone pressed f1 and that was the extraction rather than yeah you've got to put tommo in yeah that wasn't how many points thanks johnny saved my life sacrificed your own joshua i sacrificed mine jack sacrificed me easiest difficulty that's fine yeah it's not living you learn apart from johnny that doesn't hold your hand this game [Music] next level so this is the one with the megalodon should be jack yeah the final uh final extract i believe interesting interesting poor johnny yes indeed jacob i can't believe i savage that was i mean i'll get on with one seconds ago yeah but thomas said get off i just figured if you ran away from the extracts though and it would cancel it no well i thought you had to stand on that but no instead it yeah it just shuts the area down m.i.a rescue okay so i have room for mistakes in this game yeah this first objective here if we alert too many bad guys they start killing the hostage so we've got it like we've got to think about this okay mm-hmm i've got body armor as well i don't know if you guys have unlocked that i sure have yes sir maybe one person take a stun grenade as well if you've got one yeah i've been taking stuns sweet i don't have them yet got smokes that's it smokes as well yeah good pulse for this one all right we're gonna drop a code in the chat here guys i'll just nab that real quick no don't take it tom you're clearly playing the game right now but then i'll do a giveaway genius liberty of your code you're gonna wait but someone will take it by then won't they you can't just claim to go and hold why would i not open these doors over here what do these do here what do i do johnny uh yeah what do you mean i will say story there might be supplies in here well yeah you don't know where your objective is going to be the maps are quite big so okay so it's just another area yeah but if you see exactly where you're going is this a random objective each time it might make you play on like the west side of the map or the east side of the map fascinating now remember what i said yeah don't aggro them yeah just get him in there's a couple there's an invisible guy here as well i need to throw a stun grenade first on grenade let's just get him out i'm going to get him i'm not stunning no no it's fine nice johnny okay let's go back to the extract that's what we have to take in man yeah four enemies on the left i don't know what this lad was doing in here just like chilling as well wasn't he got a hazmat suit it did actually yeah okay we've got something here johnny we're not going to leave you behind this time i hear that track what i want to see is you want to see the action i mean that was pretty easy considering how close he was to the start and the extract it's not always that easy though is it no are you doing up the air jack i'm bloody taking out that nest tomorrow what are you doing down here tom i fell oh dude come back tom what wait walk through that do it again it like sticks to your feet that's quite cool look what's this is it gooping at them oh my god that's really that's a nice detail it grabs you that's kind of it's actually like scooping yeah you're pulling the matter behind you that's sick is that glass no all right well we might as well just look for supplies and then get to the extract there's something over here but there's also a couple of baddies hang on i took the guy down got the credit got the points and it was still alive yeah i just realized you don't start with max health do you start it depends did you use that operator last time tom no no you used it before no i haven't that's weird i think that's the thing like you've played with it in the past and the operator is still recovering but if you look at the bottom the bar mine's not half and this is brand new for me mine's a hundred but then i take i just took a medkit there i think you've just got room for boosted health i don't know can i heal you i don't think you ever start with 200 health let's go check if there's any heals in the next decontamination area first you're adapting well to the circumstances well there's another one whoever needs it maybe i know johnny that's some reason we'll come we'll come here afterwards was what she wanted to do in the main part jack or we did the objective straight away cool what's all these weird noises they're little monsters up there all right everyone vote into the museum we go [Music] i think this might be this next areas where you find the megalodon oh my god our spines are making the arcanes adaptable to any environment rushes to extract points make up on this dude oof there's a boy over here a lot of spores there hamilton liberty island museum try and get this one away it was the nest that produced the swarm they start expanding out i was saying this yesterday like imagine a horror game on this engine like how good would it look it would look very nice i presume this is the same engine as siege right i don't know it looks a lot cleaner but it's just single player though or co-op so maybe that's the difference oh here it it is go ahead keep going that way the megalodon's here so you see the rook on the boat oh yeah you shoot the boat are you here johnny i am should we see shoot that guy do the boat not him and he's in it he's in the mouth it was literally a 2d sprite yeah that was so fast it's a really quick easter egg what the hell i was expecting like a battlefield level like 3d model in a row it's more of the case that someone would be like oh look if you look if you look you can see a rook saluting in that boat and then someone would shoot it and then oh whoa nowhere and he's in the mouth it's jump scares what you're telling me like if we'd have found that naturally jack we'd have gone crazy but the fact that we were told about it disappointed just uh just not well uh this game is on game pass yeah it is i didn't see him in the corner he just called for backup you get close enough to walls as well your uh flashlight has bioluminescence so you can see the enemies through walls yeah i killed a couple in this room this house yeah it's nice i wore bang them did you are you saying in real life i can see through life with uv c3 walls with uv lights no you no just a nice feature of the game i got a headshot of that one this is a now i asked about this last time that i was streaming this on twitch apparently this is a real museum i don't know if it looks exactly like this but well yeah look there's a whole like layout of liberty island here oh you've been to new york you come here jack come to you tom you've got a shotgun no okay you could made a hole that's right but look i guess we're in one of these buildings i'm on yeah such a liberties here but it's actually it's very similar it's actually quite a sizable island johnny did you go to the libby island are you going to new york is this place real uh it doesn't ring a bell come here johnny it's left how about where you came there's the door my door yeah i mean the mountain big hole in the wall yeah is this plastic uh are we real does this check out i can't do this bit over here okay did this bit and i did went on top of this so which building is the museum in i guess this is the one jack stood on did you find any aliens when you went there no i didn't i i looked but they weren't about you did look for some aliens assume they don't do tuesdays all right okay arc spines yeah i completely forgot we're like supposed to be doing injectors it's definitely not here is it we create our own objectives ie paul liberty museum in the game i mean it's going to be through here in it oh you can just shoot their legs as well it looks like the uh exploded guys no that doesn't make a difference there we don't need go okay so this one we have to plant two charges and then they will try and defuse them oh my god there's so many nests in there what the hell spikerlad should we get rid of some of this sprawling shotguns are really good for that okay right um you ready tom yeah let's go i'll do this one johnny you do the one in there uh yeah punching the balls off johnny okay now we need to defend them from trying to defuse them but you can get up somewhere here there we go i'll get b you guys johnny goes in between i've got the uh the overlook you're the high ground all right around anakin i didn't realize you know they'd released a little one minute like behind the scenes trailer for the kenobi series on disney plus yeah yeah there's not much in it but it's cool it's got a few clips of like uh hayden christensen and obi-wan like practicing sword fighting and stuff awesome i'm getting shot by a spiker somewhere he's over here well there's not many coming to be have you got a lot of hey now we're good we're good they're all spawning up here with me really i'm i wonder if you being up there has like made ai change maybe oh my god it's a foot one two three four five just checking nine seconds well the nests just grow wherever there's uh sprawl or whatever yeah good okay oh it's disappearing look at it uh i'm over here i'm gonna grab that is anyone really low on ammo um yeah i got about eight hundred all right i'll take it i'll come back i used one already so okay there was one left in that all right good job this reminds me of um avatar like all these things here looks like pandora oh yeah i've only seen that movie once yeah i think i've only seen it once as well i've seen bits of it like just on tv but never watched it from start to finish the second time i don't i i wonder if the cgi still holds up i watched it recently it definitely does really does yeah even the characters what they called um it was so ahead of it yeah stay calm it's because of the budget like a lot of movies with cgi like that just down the budget i'd argue that the cgi and avatar still looks better than a lot of marvel stuff these days really i need to watch it again then reloading they're always uh marvel always have like really quick turnarounds for their cgi it's passed on to the animators and uh oh yeah it's really late i watched the corridor crew one about black panther and how the final fight is just like terrible because they only had like two weeks to do it yeah it was already like a few days before the premiere oh i'm gonna start this seismic station i don't know if that's gonna happen here we need a and b first we need to locate all three do we yeah just because it's gonna make us run slim in sequence and if we don't know the sequence oh you failed it don't you yeah should be one in this room with you somewhere watch out for the flashbang things on the ground yeah that's it i somehow saw it without seeing it there's b so we just gotta find a now [Music] i'm gonna go through here and check what the rumble what the rumble did you see did you guys see that yeah my game just started shaking it's stopped now a lot of gas and stuff here yeah i was johnny out of curry last night though oh yeah sorry through here maybe maybe we're too far oh there it is okay i've walked into it ow at height all right so if we activate this yeah start a i'm gonna hit it now so we can keep running okay let's go together find a way is it upstairs oh it's down there 15 seconds can you shoot that thing johnny i'll get this there we go and then you got to see someone it doesn't i don't think it indicates where the other two are or maybe it does but you're always so far away from them that you can't finish it in the time okay um extraction yeah there's only one ammo thing i'm pretty good at i wonder why they called it that um maybe because you shoot the alien goo i mean yeah probably yeah well that's a really successful run right there yeah it was good pride and joy no one went down played a pretty stealthy i saw the megalodon did get a lot of xp for that yeah saw jason statham i think he lost that fight though two seconds he was the bloke on the boat tom yeah yeah we're ruined aren't we but you can see him in the mouth like holding the jaws open jason's ruined as well yep it's a megalodon bring the squad with me all right we should put up the difficulty i think i think i i was about to say should we try the next one up yeah because now johnny's a bit more used to it was that the easiest one we just did that was easiest difficult well even that's a bit of a challenge i think it a lot of it though depends on the role you get with the aliens yeah you know if you get a lot of like exploding boys running at you yeah it's probably more difficult or if you get an elite or a boss or something we had a lot of like defending objectives there so there weren't as many aggressive enemies i don't think but if you get the ones where it's like a target you have to kill it's usually more of an onslaught yeah i'm gonna select cautious difficulty now we get plus 50 objective xp on that all right all right i'm back johnny we've gone up for difficulty just seeing great news i like that the game forces you to use different operators you can't just pick a main like you could in scenes you know like when you're low on health you have to switch up don't know who i'm playing as best you pick now capture the elite target defeat an elite target destroy aberrant ness we've gotta bait the guy onto our extract platform right yeah okay holding cells no mutation that's good spraying with expanding foam i'm gonna play as i've got a doc here but he's not full hp i'll play his lion i'll be thinking i mean you just inject yourself out of the gate jack if you want to yeah but it's only temporary health isn't it you don't get permanent health right yeah it ticks down over time doesn't it you're right you still got stun grenades one of you yeah okay i think it's cool it's like his body armor [Music] ready let's do it i'm gonna drop another code in the chat here guys this is for the epic game store and i think it's the deluxe edition of the game as well on pc [Music] here we go this reminds me of the division this area it does look like like the shd like campus a high value our game is here you played a lot of division didn't you tom when you finally played this yeah did you like do end game stuff not really i did a bit of dark zone but um yeah i mean once i sort of got my character leveled up to the basic point [Music] this is a harder difficulty so try not to take any damage on the ones behind him so that only he's isolated i remember when grenada instant throw good to know good yeah yeah oh i'm big braininess all right game on and i'll press the button when he's here come on grunt grunter he slapped me charlie bit me don't t-bag him tom well john wait going on there tomorrow just go just so you guys know i'm reloading i can't forget you can lean in this game look i don't think you need to though in this right like i understand that against the spiker oh yeah maybe it's super beneficial what's that there he's just so accurate he just hit me once there and i went down from like 100 hp to 37. it kind of makes me want to play cj get it away just to get you know go back on it and play siege in a couple of years now actually i played it quite recently a few months back but yeah it's like uh really capitalizing the mechanics that are in the game everything that's in siege is here though so did you do a video on it uh no i don't think i did i streamed it can i heal myself yeah just hold on hold the button if you have siege and you unlock the operators in this you also get them given to you in the main siege game yeah okay you don't know that did you did you just fire two at me johnny yep because i held the button but it was the other button you met which is good news that's fine um so that first one was pretty easy thanks thanks john i needed that that's a spiker there another lean peeking jiggle peak this is how you play season you walk around like doing this you have to do like a maniac though jack this is that's the only way you survive and see you do this there's a few enemies in the way between the uh oh open the story there's a lad in there spiker it's like this just looks like stranger things right here doesn't it right yeah sliding everywhere head glitching what the hell spiker was playing like an actual player the drum magazine floating in the air what the draw magazine it's just a drum magazine target right so we go through yeah we can do the next objective that's a big one got that door behind you lads close that door for donkey watch him funky get out of my swamp this is my swamp i got some react tech here disgusting well it was [Music] we're going deeper into the swamp fiona fiona it's michael myers isn't it it does that yeah right what we got okay now we've got to kill the elite no way we'd like to mobilize against us kill spikers to attract there we go kill one more and then we'll get him to come out that one over here that's uh all three of them right yeah all right now we're gonna kill the big lad where is he let's get in this big room here where i am well is he gonna come to us we have to find him i don't know there he is all right anyone got stunned lovely yeah uh you look like a demogorgon i went behind it and it was just like i don't think you you want to do a takedown no i don't think so there's some uh reacts like that if you need more stuns and stuff how is this cube floating up like that what the hell looks like a slug hello explodey boys i'm blowing ammo now i've got a little glitch spot there i mean there is one more ammo thing on this level somewhere okay oh god that spike it has ruined me ow dude that's the spores when they stick to you eventually explode this reminds me of the dark knight whack me off i'll whack you off thank you tell me them balls you got all the balls oh yeah johnny how much have you got uh i got enough i've been splitting my stuff between my opponent's foreign all right all right jack wick oh jolly watch out health uh johnny get that maybe oh tomo time we're gonna go yeah oh oh that was close johnny that was about to explode i didn't even know i had that one yeah well if you see like a yellow splash in the corner of your screen like that will let you know that there's a tennis ball on you okay next obj is to destroy the aberrant neck nests [Music] these are the green ones that the gas come out of them locate the name i don't know isn't that 15 of them oh there they are you've seen through the wall destroy them i mean it's going to pop off isn't it oh yes there's 15 of them we need to destroy so well don't rush into this because we could easily just get mobbed here we need to stick together have you got a route in there tom yeah i'm getting these nests killed there's quite a few of them actually you can do it if we do it it's really fast full of exploding lads this is going to get messy keep my distance up if need be don't need to worry about causing aggro here three more to go another one dead another one dead definitely oh that's performed okay oh you have to melee that one you have to melee that one i'll hold f on it or something yeah just go and hold f we'll cover tom yeah we'll cover him off all right off we go central park there look hey let's go i want to check that out what was central park like johnny did you check that out it was snowy so it looked a lot like snow adorable it looked like snow did you go at winter like christmas time don't be on february like president's day weekend and it was like six inches of snow or something another successful extraction so that was the the second difficulty i killed that that cost me a bit more health than last time yeah i got slapped up a bit didn't lose any operators was really useful i got a challenge done there or something yeah we're also going to pkp nice is that it's going to be in this game when you hit f10 it'll show your objectives you get more xp from it how do we get my finger back because it's gone though on the same level should we go do that on the easiest difficulty he can fly through it which phase did he die at do you remember johnny it's the last one uh yeah it was last wasn't it yeah we'll just skip the objectives and grab him was it first mission or second we did that i've got a cut scene right now first monolith gardens okay i'll put it on easiest one and then we'll just run through we'll get your operator bob's your own call boom manager why was that so easy patrick because we're an elite unit that's why you can crank the difficulty and make it a lot less easier than that also you never know how what sort of enemies you're gonna face i think because johnny's only just started playing this though like if this is a nice ramp up isn't it yeah i mean we've got many more levels to go through here so i also need to get scripts for the controls so we need to get to the third root of the third room so we can just run through yeah just run through the first team get to the third get your operator let's throw my shotgun okay smash the how many difficulties are there i think there's four right is there four i think there's four you have to unlock the difficulties no no they just saw that okay yeah looks like it what graphic settings i'm playing on ultra pontus i thought sally was my aunt no it's funny [Music] yeah i mean if you want to try this guys i'd suggest trying it on game pass like before you buy it just try on game pass first also i believe if one person owns the game uh two friends can play for free for a period of time well there's a little like invite thing as well they have a body system you invite them through you play and you can play with a full squad for yeah like two weeks okay all right i've got two seconds i just need to talk on my run that's right you should be safe here anyway i mean i can probably play this starting area yeah i'm gonna guys i'm gonna use the lmg next mission because we're just running through this real quick so we can get johnny's operator back we could recover the asset whilst johnny's away jack oh he's only 30 meters away okay okay read not to you know i'm just going to grab him yeah just go from there there's a door here son is it brian again it's all cranny it's a lady this time okay it's um okay right let's go third extraction then yeah [Music] your goal bosh right now lovely jubbly okay so if you hit f10 you'll see the objectives you have for each uh each level king ness on walls of the center you'll get more xp for that progression tree and stuff injectors are in the dispenser and then you can plant them in the nutrient node unalerted are you a grunt yes objective complete will grow back eliminate my target keep running there we go that's a nice tip tom that is the uh the challenges yeah i just did that that easy they're called studies study tv code oh my god i'm so surrounded here you need help i think i'm all right i'm just gonna keep running through the store i'll open up some of the doors i underestimated how many enemies are gonna be in that room especially the splody ones i find if you marry them as they're about to explode they stop for a second you guys just want to extract or uh well we need to go we need to get johnny's thing don't we oh of course we need to do the uh yeah let's just get through to the last stage and then get him out the tree i like those sounds all the maps procedural or pre-made the maps are procedural pontus but the objectives and the enemies that you face are randomized i think that's the same for the challenges as well i've shot this door on them okay we have to find the tree now yeah we can find johnny's old body johnny's old body yeah instead of zombies it was still a round base like zombie game but it was little aliens instead yeah they were like starship trooper aliens weren't there um there's a lot of goop around here so we're probably near it you need to be get yourself pull yourself off johnny and then we'll do the shirt okay so basically we have to shoot the the pulses when they open up yeah like shoot this fighting back there as well of there otherwise it reabsorbs i'm taking care of the baddies tom we're getting there how many left johnny johnny you should be able to tell us when a an orange like when a new one is coming to give the tree health as well should tell you how many somewhere on the screen i guess if there's any threat right now to the extraction character just fell i'm gonna boost us let's go i'm reloading extractions indoors okay okay i think there's a skylight maybe above yeah you grapple through that put yourself in there johnny there you go and then you can use that guy again there we go saved thinker good all right on to the next level is it the next like full level yeah yeah we've done all of new york nice i think yeah we did monolith gardens libby island the police station off the san fran now we're going to san francisco san francisco bro we're going to see the wharf get some crap go and see alcatraz i'm going to drop another code in the chat here first come first serve this is an epic game store code for the game deluxe edition san francisco tenderloin this is called is golden gate bridge in any of these levels um you can see it in the background maybe yeah you can see it in the background on the third one on the apollo casino okay tenderloin right now do you want to try second difficulty again oh the fourth difficulty is locked and you get that milestone 11. yeah i thought you had to unlock difficulties i think you're a bit higher though so i don't think you would have had that third one unlocked at the start of the game okay should we try cautious again yeah yeah because i presume with this being the second level it might get more difficult anyway so do cautious no one needs a code we want connect you mean xbox connect or do you want me to just send you a connect i'll have to go to the local charity shop and see if they've got one there and then i'll send you one that's the bay bridge okay yeah is the tenderloin district a real place inside sounds very tasty doesn't it you just eat the buildings there in real life just eat everything like charlie the chocolate factory everything's made of meat oh dear quite like charming the chocolate factory savory edition right okay i'm gonna wha what operator can i get the lmg on any uh you'll get it on oh thank you okay cool yeah think about it think about this tomo try the holographic site instead pkp pick up a person egg yeah the final gadget you can unlock it's definitely like swift putting the timing to unlock some of that stuff because you get one that when you aim at the sprawl on the ground it just uh evaporates it i guess it sprays the sprawl you just look at it yeah like a mist that kills it you don't have to waste any ammo just a gadget on your gun i guess that's really useful to have mm-hmm or might be its own gun didn't have time to look at it tenderloin yeah apparently it is a real place my chat is saying and it's kind of like the skid row of san francisco right now nice i've got skid row rnd needs it alive and tony's got scared of that curry last night aren't you johnny oh goodness guys look at this cow this is an alien museum have you ever seen a ufo for real um have you seen something in the sky that you can't explain yeah i have normal lights well the northern lights can be explained though yeah but i can't explain it yeah but scientists can yeah but you said you used the term you [Music] and you're not a scientist no this is like eight imagine seeing that when there wasn't scientists yeah imagine you're like a human five thousand years ago and you see that in the sky that's where religion came from isn't it yeah just i can't explain this it must be god you draw the short straw and you you spawn in iceland you spawn in iceland yeah i suppose humans do spawn in a way yeah we spawn when you spawn ones though yeah you don't respawn irl right we've got to get this guy back to the extraction guys i've got a lot of those spiker dudes it would be the short story like imagine just not having the right clothing to survive that weather tom you've killed it literally no i'm luring it to the extraction which was the objective oh no i literally just said i was so just like in my own head thinking about the northern lights jack that i wasn't really thinking you forgive me yes thank you we just can't mess up the next objective because that's pain please forgive me i felt it you found me the other day as well what were we doing i don't know you did something didn't you a failure at least one supply session once every day you know what time you're my son and i'll always love you what yeah thanks dad you know the episode of dr phil that we filmed that was real oh my flashbang what the cash me outside how about that that was you a lot of these shitty boys yeah they're quite painful for some reason i thought i had to assassinate that guy to get a sample of him [Music] really wasn't the case was it there's a model of i think this is ufo guys [Music] remember the ufo easter egg from battlefield it's here oh yeah remag was 50 drunk but he was right [Music] there's weird music in here autopsy room what i've walked into sports great guys i feel like godzilla when i'm in this room there's an alien it's e.t that's not e.t what you immediately shot him you said it wasn't e.t early yeah i do actually feel like godzilla johnny i feel like you guys are outgrowing everything i'm having to clean it up on the way to get to you that's what i feel like right now all right but be careful what's going on here didn't ask when is this going out is that now alex didn't ask helpless ratio look at that i'll post ricky alien artifacts i'm going to look in here oh no whack me off tom i'm coming i'm coming it must be my pleasure oh no they won't come back this is the gift shop why do you just shoot everything were you a difficult child to see if i can well i know because i'm your dad so look at you what am i doing just calm down you've had too many panda pops it wasn't me it's really panda pops right where are we going we need to go yeah we need to go play the game like johnny's the only sensible one i'm just i'm just trying to snap you out of it honestly distract you from just looking at everything this is the only one helping the team okay we're in this big room now yeah it's this way that's a cool noise oh my god look at this keep looking ahead goop oh yeah we failed objective don't know why tom you know exactly why we failed the objective anyway we move he's just going to edit out the video isn't he you've got a spore on your ass oh [Music] can you think of me please [Music] right johnny do you want shall i do the pulling this time you want to pull yeah close that door i mean this one's easy because we're like it's all on the ground level [Music] it's really clear there's no no columns in the way or anything you face one way jack no columbus clouds it's working archery is easy let it go oh we absolutely nailed so fast all right let's go clear a path to johnny that's uh me from a couple days back i've gone a bit crusty there haven't i got a bit across there yeah well there's a lot of expanding foam on me right there this way johnny right uh yeah set the operator down in the extraction pod put me in there as tomorrow said it's a cheese though it kind of is a bit cheesy it's not a cheeto i'd eat another pioneer there's a picture of a foot here virus infection parasite they're trying to figure out what it is aren't they johnny tom is anyone going to stop you from back up you just keep looking at everything joe we've got i don't look at everything this is so serious we've been sent into like this is oh my god it actually is a raving rabbit wait that's a flash fun listen come upstairs we're going to the next area nothing passes you you should move to the next one pinker finger please maintain that focus thank you health kit here nice johnny right up the stairs [Music] [Music] it just jammed you in the middle of it does anyone need this ability yeah uh no i've got um who am i playing if it's going but i don't need it armor what i'm i'm habana oh i said [Music] because she's good at breaching walls and stuff but i think this is just basically a grenade launcher against the enemies which is cool oh that looks cool that was me johnny i got i got headshot credits and weak point credits tomorrow is in a different version of the world johnny okay he's thomas now still got spoiler on me ever in fact i am like the kid you need to you need to keep me on a leash you can actually melee the sprawl as well where's the fun in that though yeah it doesn't have a massive area of effect unless you play a sledge hello what are you i think sledge that has a bigger like melee hit on the straw tormentor he was called what ability does ella have i don't know ella has the little uh zoom thing gas i don't know what they're made of little explosive things you stick on the mines yeah look at this growing jack yeah it's sick and it's really cool effect the goop release the singularity they call if the door jammed like if you can you can go through a door unless you shot the sprawl around it because it was sticking it down shut this door behind you this pkp is really good how much ammo do you get in a single mag 100 whoa whoa whoa what the hell is that here oh my smoke yeah oh you got he sprawled off me thanks mate well what is this dude where are you johnny right here this is the teleport guy release the singularity what does that mean [Music] uh like but the power of the sun in the palm of my hands that's what it looks like superman press tab these thrills yeah looks like [Applause] don't leave it right this is our first boss i have 20 health i'm going to boost her straight away all right change the things intro what boss is it going to be i haven't seen this yet well so just be like any operator it can be [Music] oh it's spawning there what the hell you can't keep it marked forever it just teleports uh you might find health kits as well so look out for them okay slap them react tech and ammo that's him grab some ammo i don't know which operator is no i can't tell i i've not thought this sounds like alibi because they've got that oh yeah it's got a gun yeah i think it might be alibi that's healthy i'm gonna grab that watch out it looks like it does a lot of damage oh my god the teleporting is crazy oh i hope we don't hit each other can we stun it the health is at the top of your screen oh so it's got a shield i see yeah the white thing's a shield that actually helps yeah yeah it's alive she's cloned herself you have to get the right one you can't melee them though okay this is interesting this is really cool you killed one but i don't think you have to kill her clone she's still up she's still up is that one yeah you see at the top she has a white it's like bar above the red health that's her shield we can't do the actual damage until that's gone this one's crazy because she continuously clones herself it's actually a pretty cool idea where did she go for me that's the real one the one that's running away the email through the wall that's really useful that you tagged that oh my god what the hell was that just charging your shield again is it gonna explode oh god she's clowned herself multiple times i'm gonna smoke it i think it marks them as well [Music] over here somewhere that really hurts me there's just three of them here i was getting this little room this is sick because the boss fight is gonna be different every i just assumed they'd run around shooting but this is actually she's doing the alibi ability here help yeah come here son come here nice i think jack needs it more now i've got boosted more than jack should i take it all right i'll take it thank you we've barely put a dent in her like yeah but no more shield right so is that it watch out it's going to explode or something again it's like cocoons herself and then explodes dude i've got 12 grenades is that the real one you've tagged i think so yeah oh my god what just happened to me dude the impacts are so good against meat actually oh we found the cheese this is the cheese [Music] i don't know which the real one is how do you tell i think you spot them because you you only see that red triangle above the head when it's the real one oh no oh no i don't have any smokes left god don't want to die oh i'm on 10 hp sorry god yeah i'm also so low why should you just turn it up to 11. i need to find no no no no i need to find a health kit are they attacking you yeah they got their shields up damn it there's no health kits [Music] hold on [Music] proceeding clone she's still over there while we're down yeah she's over by us thankfully she doesn't try and thirst like that i'm on three hp there you go there you go you're up you're up jack that's huge massive play i'm on three hp man what though just try and kill her as soon as possible yeah ah so what we should be doing that's it johnny yeah trying killer as soon as possible [Music] there come on you do another health boost jack or no you need it more than anyone it's on cooldown for another 20 seconds there's ammo there if you need [Music] oh sh no killarkins to revive okay oh tom watch out watch out because she's going to kill you hold it hold it hold it a bit more i'm down i'm dead yeah i don't think i'm gonna do this [Music] those impact grenades are really good if you have any left is tough i've got to find some health somewhere it's a reload i hate this i mean there's no way i can do this right [Music] oh [Music] you gotta find somewhere where you can just hold oh that is so hard yeah that's difficult it's all the clones just make that deadly you just don't know what you're killing and that's only the second difficulty as well that passive res is huge with finka we replay that one or do we can carry on we can carry on we can do the next mission it's just we'll all be dead in there that's what i mean how do you save yourself when you die in that area so if we go to replay yeah if we go back to menu yeah that was tricky i assume they'll just be resivable in the third stage right was that ten that was tenderloin wasn't it yeah what protein was that that was alibi right was that alibi um i think it was yeah because she was cloning herself caught your kick kick in that particular situation strongman that was mental haven't done that before actually a challenge and that's not even harder difficulty what's up dankvids hey hold it there is no recall in that pkp yeah it looks like it i'm going to drop them second stage yeah we'll just go run to second get them out nice try well play thank you fuji we're going to drop another code in the chat here guys what's the code for jack it is for this game rainbow six extraction deluxe edition on the epic game store on the epic game store use code jackfruits oh yeah i tell you what anytime i do i use called jackfrags oh thank you johnny that's kind of you me too jackie just uh thank you tom that's kind of yeah i thought it went without saying you know i mean thomas what about g fuel though like if i were to buy g fuel what code would i use on the store oh jack you can use whatever code you want but um yeah i mean you know everyone knows that kotomo is the best kotomo how do you spell that it's t-o m-o-jack okay interesting and what what does that do well it gives you thirty percent off right now no way thirty percent steel steal i mean it's you know it's fewer characters than code westy so i don't know what you use but hang on to the effort isn't there another content creator from the uk without no no there's not dead meat thank you for the 21 months lovely to see you playing with johnny and tommo oh you guys have fans now i know he said that but he's wrong listen let's get through to the second stage first objective i'll start with 56 hp here right blast through this get to the tree look at you wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait oh my god you should uppercut him smashed him with a sledgehammer smooth transition there fellas we're almost as good as lioness tech tips but he's the master of sponsored messaging tom that isn't going to work mate oh it worked it's a screen you have to [Music] i'll do the pulling johnny you have a bit of shooting this time oh i like balloons you like pulling i've been practicing for you i'd like to show the the stream all right you show the stream back okay here we go i'm pulling it clear somewhere this is how you pull out of the way and then while i'm doing this they have to shoot the red things one two three four five coming guys doesn't it show like a number on your screen it just shows me that a little like red thing yeah how many left yeah whoa dude in the water none at the moment one two follow the branches and you have to shoot them three on the way two one one oh that's two there's two coming uh yeah i've been watching tomorrow ever since he was the dead guy in acolyte videos what oh yeah i don't think thomas ever died in a video game no no [Applause] the pub g days conor had like 10 years of pc game time under his belt and pub g was the first game i'd ever played on pc it was a it was a mess well you just died all the time and then connor just posted those videos one time is he your friend you know what it's like jack where's your content quick because connor was always the one who's down in my videos because you just get your best moments when you have to clutch yeah that's the situation so like when people came to my videos well tommy's not as bad as he looks in connor's hideous that was not an incompetent fool what's going on that's positive right yeah it's a little bar but it's positive if he likes led us to believe he's an idiot someone needs to press the uh the button i think it's johnny it's all shy again now that's stoked ptsd every time i see it in case i'm going to get killed again okay right so we've got those operators back and we'll try the next level now but we didn't beat the boss we saved ourselves we saved ourselves from impending goo quite selfish really we chose ourselves over saving the global i don't know i suppose so back to the ufo thing okay have you ever actually seen a ufo or you think it's a ufo um no i don't think i have you i have seen something that i can't explain right but it doesn't mean it was an alien were you drunk no how much um i was driving on a dual carriageway it was about 2 p.m in the afternoon i had someone else in the car yeah daytime and um there was a light floating in the sky above the dual carriageway and it was too high to be a drone and it moved away too quickly like it was almost hovering and then it just went zip and just shot up into the sky and it was very strange the way the way it moved that's the only time i've seen something that i can't explain like it was gonna be no no it was like um a light and a shape and it just suddenly it was like in the sky and then it just zipped on your windows no no bit of dust on your sunglasses no we both saw it as well the other person in the car saw it as well weird seems legit the thing is right i know these aliens yeah military test stuff all the time they don't tell us about identify flying objects like i don't think aliens have ever actually visited i don't i think we're alone in this particular galaxy i don't think there's aliens there wow i think we're just a chance well you know before a fish were discovered surely that's alien what do you define as alien [Music] well non-human aliens you know like from a different universe so yeah obviously a fish like not from planet earth are you fish people now i mean have you seen those aliens that have got like what's a fish but you know one in like nemo that's got the the light that dangles yeah to attract yeah they look like aliens don't they that's an alien as far as i'm concerned had i eaten anything funny that day no because the other person in the car saw it as well but they you know if you're funny we're sharing it we won't share we got any brownies there were no brownies do you enjoy a good brownie there was literally a light in the sky it was in a position where it was like too low down no of course it wasn't the sun it was too it was too low down to be a plane or a helicopter and it was too high up to be a drone and it literally hovered and as fast as you can imagine zipped up into the sky what if it was going to imagine pretty quick what if it was one of those fish jack why would a fish be in the sky the light you saw was actually the anger fish why would it be in the sky tom well what do you i told you they're alien like we don't know what they can can and can't do no that's a fish before it was identified it was alien please stop please did you ready up yet i'm i'm deciding what loadout to pick okay i'm typically talking about this bloody light you saw in the sky i've not been abducted either guys okay right this was a couple years ago as well it wasn't like when i was a kid like i'm very skeptical very rational okay [Music] i think it was some kind of like plane or device that was being tested were you near like an airport or any sort of um it was just a dual carriageway on the way up north i can't remember which one this is a new map a new area thomas voice makes my toes cold is that a good thing i [Music] is a good thing i don't know the other person in the car saw it with me what if there wasn't another person in the car with you the whole time jack you thought about this well can you please stand on the point i'm the only one paying any attention here i don't think it goes any faster when you've got multiple people on it it does it goes way faster oh yeah it has a little arrow but when i get off it there's only two and then go on it there's three where's the scan progress off on off come on that'd be good in the game like battlefield inbound [Music] he's satisfied to just blow holes in the walls in this game oh there's a green thing right there [Applause] let's try to break through here i'm just going to stop them are you suffering i'm stopping them one enforcement laugh there's a hole there you can literally just walk a few steps to your left and go through i'm trying to break it i mean you could buy a barricade or if you wanted you know what tom i'm gonna use the door we need to get to the last one thank you for the two months thank you you share that watch out watch out it's fine johnny you were getting stuck on the ground there it was horrible remember the arcanes travel faster in the game so it's beneficial for us to shoot it why did i just heal it i just turned around and healed it oh my god you just keep me in the face i didn't expect this many aliens we're all dying johnny's dead someone's upped me into a melee i didn't even get to move i think it stood up where did they come from easiest no we're doing the second difficulty here aliens could be in the chat well yeah they could be this door's broken now [Applause] you know what is this the first objective we're on here yeah do you want to let's extract so johnny can join us again we'll re replay this [Music] i thought of my mouth your good friend he is a good friend i can attest to that my game crashed yeah my game's crashed okay one second you still with us no it crashed okay yeah i'm sorry loading the back up [Music] it says oh no it crashed there you go it says that in the alert message yeah that was the error oh no it crashed it was when it loaded to extract it just went nope like your chat makes my toes go [Music] in a good way or a bad way i don't know was it ever was it ever decided i think toes curling is a good i don't know man i want it to be a good thing for tomorrow but i'm not sure it is you don't think it is i don't think it sounds like a good thing jack i think i know what it's referencing don't you i think so yes so that's a good thing yeah yes why would your toes curl if it was bad but like i don't know if you're cringing maybe yeah i mean i hope they're not doing what we think that's pretty alien it's a compliment aliens just crash my game yeah okay so it did actually save my character there which is good toes calling is a good thing he has a very sexy voice lol oh there you go there you go you've made it tomorrow congrats tom you you know if youtube doesn't pan out you've got a career in toe curling i'm just going to put my voice on silent first this play session um invite changer oh ignore that who should i accept i mean johnny's party now you better join mine tomorrow um have you sent an invite yeah there it is similar to making your skin crawl i don't think it's that bad no no that's what i thought when you first said it like toes curling sounds like you know cringey says the word curl isn't it yeah strike happiness like fingernails on a chalkboard thomas voice makes my teeth itch i'm i don't think your teeth can itch they don't have that they don't they haven't got those kind of things oh dude nest track okay we've got to be sneaky we're good at that no one heart though johnny we need to be sneaky put your chat up jack and someone said tomorrow can kill my toes any day toes can kill when you have a massive cramp under your foot what does that mean oh my doc he didn't make it because it crashed no oh dice please you got lost in the crash uh you don't want to play as let's give it was like qd detects react equipment i might be that might be helpful hopefully you can see uh meds and ammo and stuff fingers just open like surely i don't know i'm going to need to throw those on i like thomas voice i remember when we first started playing together you said my voice sounds like i ate your voice did i say that yeah i don't think i was questioning it it sounds like something no you definitely said it doesn't make sense though does it it doesn't seem like something you would say i didn't hear it but it does sound like one of those i have the clip if you want it jack i don't believe you somewhere but we're playing with vic that's fake news and you're like your voice sounds like you ate my voice i wouldn't say that i was like what does that mean i've literally never said that not even oh [Music] i'm just trying to think in my head tom my dialect right right would i ever say that no jack you say some weird i could see you saying that no that i mean listen we were supposed to be stealthy so we could do the nests he literally shot everything straight you literally shot everything inside well we walked around the corner and it screamed at us yeah but you can be stealthy though can't you we didn't ask for it to scream us i found a dormant nest oh my god i'm on 20 hp already whose fault is that really ammunition please listen there's gotta be some dormant nests in here i found one that one's definitely dormant now this one's so light how can you tell they just look right they're not angry don't breathe they don't breathe like they're closed you know like they have the the leaves or whatever are growing over them there's one here i think that's an angry one though that's an angry one johnny it's been allowed so we might as well shoot that looks like this looks fine one of us one of us should have played pulse we've been really good johnny i'm pretty sure that's alert yeah this one's alert take down all right just crawl just crawl to the next bit okay okay [Music] whack the spools [Music] watch out for the green what's going on someone voice sounds like cork's husband all right we continue uh i'm corpse i'm gonna read you all her story he did the um damn it he he got paid to do the uh trailer voice for dying like two really yeah look we've literally failed hard as well don't worry i killed him i shot him in the weak spots if you marry them before they explode they don't explode see now this is a really bad role because they've got spores on and there's a lot of green red lights oh my god [Music] no oh my god this is meant to be touched we need to get somewhere [Music] oh my god you're kidding me it was literally like half a second there so i mean all it takes is one of them to get alerted and then everyone gets alerted because of the spore like it connects them right um there are two med kits in here i think we should find them because with my scanner there's two over here somewhere it's ammo let's react there's another one further back yeah we should really find out we feel the mission then we've failed this objective yeah but we can go through and do the rest let's get there jack market this uh iq thing is really cool yeah that's useful so there's one yeah that's the main kit he's a teammate i see one okay i've got this one i've got a spores on me johnny can you whack me now did you find the other one i'm looking around now was that only a one a single use one there's one there oh my god i open the door and the thing blow up my face yes that was single use that one i've got a spore on me johnny johnny want me left whack oh oh my god we are so bad at this we are so bad at this this is like a very there's a lot of enemies yeah it's a bad roll man like sometimes it's a lot more passive but we've got a lot of aggro enemies in this one yeah trying to find this last gotta be around here somewhere is that it that's ammo there's ammo here could it be in the airlock yeah that's a good point yeah it might be let's go to the airlock johnny you gave it your best shot keep moving forward no it's not in the airlock okay oh it's in the airlock it is uh will you take that you and johnny are about the same i mean you're pretty low down yeah i don't need any ammo so if you guys want to say that okay what's this then specimen catch the okay we gotta lure it don't kill it okay i'll assassinate it then yeah yeah tommy just going saturday i caught it jack oh it's gone later guys i'd rather watch a tilted league player sorry have fun chat see you later jason bell bye though do you and tommy need a third no we got johnny johnny's a legend who stays in the description but johnny is a legend in the description i literally wrote johnny's the legend in the description yeah what did you put for me i just put out tomographic normal guy i guess [Music] will he blow through it probably yeah oh my god oh this way this way this way i'll make some holes you got a shotgun no i don't unfortunately thank you so i've got a org is he right behind us yeah he's following come on smashy oh god there he is he's coming johnny watch your back come this way let's go smashy he's alerted the horde come on smashy boy get ready to press it press it capture systems lovely you know what the old stunning press we did it right there didn't we you delivered on your engine i don't think it said that t-bag to collect sample oh is it collect that's a deposit all right good okay even though we're pretty low hp i reckon we can do this we can do it we'll get oh this is the subjective capture right yeah let's go to the airlock stay on yeah stay on me go in stealth use your pistols if need be spores careful oh what me there we go thank you johnny gotcha recharge behind if anyone needs it uh i'm full no i'm gonna pop there we go that's a good idea jack use the one you have oh [Music] yeah we're through good good job nothing left to do here oh there's a lot of bad guys in here i've got spores on me quite a few of them if you can hit me shut the door close the door who did that i think someone still had some view on them [Music] i have some ammo if you need it i don't see any i don't see any sports repeatedly emitter yeah this is tricky here's the cereal scan again right yeah all these nests there's quite a few nests just blast them we need to find the ghost the ghost boys yeah there's a lot of spools around surprised that sounds like fun i've got spores on me tom come in like me i've got a reload have we found the ghosties where are they no i'm looking around in here maybe we're looking forward to sorry got a little boost from me [Music] check upstairs [Music] i don't see the ghosties probably somewhere up here checked everywhere downstairs if you have a recon device on me i think okay yeah it's balls on me oh there's another area though through here can you wipe me off yeah i got losing my butt now you're clear bye i hate these spikers man they ruin you yeah they're quite difficult oh my god the spores are everywhere i want to hear tomorrow say onomatopoeia [Music] oh he's pretending jack there's not one on my bum anyway you just you ask yourself you got me ladies and gentlemen we got him are you in trouble there johnny [Music] johnny keeps coming after me reloading oh i need a melee help me sorry reloading whack me jackie boy wacky jackie boost why not oh i'm just knocked to the floor i think it's for me as well somewhere [Music] yeah there's only one ammo thing in this room so can't find any health anywhere on the top oh where did you come from  me i got a thing on me [Music] very good okay i've got to reload man this is getting tough cheers yeah we're getting more oh behind me okay last one oh please last one and we can get out we're good get forgetful [Music] i'm gonna barricade can you boost health jack yeah one sec are you chuck when i said melanie did you just not do it no i did [Music] maybe i'd maybe i'm missing hate these spikers dude i just want to hear thomas say i'm going to live stream today you rest we need to next down we'll put me in knockout yeah we just get this and we'll extract [Music] i can't even see that guy because the smoke go go go man that was tricky that was really hard no do you think harry styles knows that he's in the mcu yeah don't spoil it though jack um damn that was uh that was hectic that was probably the most intense like yeah of enemies we've had but luckily we got out alive didn't lose anyone i just i'm not glue grenade i had that yeah do you just throw that into a room and it just like gets rid of those enemies okay interesting i think i'd rather have a stun grenade than slow people because i think it does the same thing anyway right [Music] uh use your tech upgrades as well if you've got points yep i wish the ammo satchel was like deployable for the team it's just like an individual thing to you that allows you to deploy with 50 percent more ammo okay you can't give it to anyone you just have more in reserve yeah but jack at the end of the tech thing the react laser reactor dissolves the sprawl present in the environment when aiming at it uh like that you can just keep walking through it well that's cool that's a milestone that's engaging i'll put some game time into it yeah interesting whack me johnny right last san francisco level apollo casino and resort we'll do cautious again i think cautious is good enough yeah i wonder if you can get a worse roll than that though depending on the modifiers [Music] thomas i'm gonna drop another code in chat now it's for the epic game store that's so weak i'm thomas am i thomas thomas i bet you've got a good movie myself now it says that perfectly balanced as all things should be oh yeah perfectly balanced as all things should be i mean you sounded a bit like the guy from game of thrones air tom yeah the guy from game of thrones yeah the guy you go khaleesi i've got the grey scale but not on my you know ah khaleesi i've got the grey scale when a bit oh i finished it sorry [Music] you're lying for this one he marks his enemies right who are you going to play johnny uh maybe not actually because he's going uh hello i think hello okay hello hello i'm going gonna go hibano again my grenade launcher is pretty cool what about rook with that armor pack that might be useful taking a p90 extended barrel bit more damage red dot sight can i put a suppressor on the magnum no i can't that's a shame yeah ammo satchel body armor okay that's good confirm loadout let's go do this team [Music] there's a casino i don't think i've ever been in a casino have you been in one jonathan yeah which casinos have you been adapted uh ones are hotels generally i'm from the area look around for them i've been like the mgm grounder they've got all the famous ones in las vegas right yeah right there okay so we've got to plant the bombs here not get away with available right next bomb this p90 is sick the stock up that oh that was close i need to take stein some of those guys is that one of your challenges pink and unalerted breach full blower space charge i'll get on the stairs on charger slapped me shout me if you need help with me yeah i'm just manning the corridor between you guys i went to one of the crown casinos got kicked out after winning fifty dollars in poker is that true fifty dollars yeah i feel like our pockets would be deeper than that oh we've got a nice one in south germany it's in a castle that's sick is it like a real castle and they put the casino in it oh the spiker please biker grove spiker spiker spike us by goggle uh-huh okay these spores are everywhere you just give me a little slap johnny thank you reloading i thought this said rainbow six is this a mod no it's a new game are you left on me that was pretty good i enjoyed that you enjoyed that did you yeah it was well i mean hey there's barely any enemies to you i mean absolute psycho was it bad over there i mean i don't work out that's for sure okay there's three medical crates in this section so we should find those before we get to the next okay okay i can't scan for them anymore oh there's one here let's have a look around maybe check the um soon as you near it check the extraction area the the meme yeah i just got one from there that's the only one that was available in here though so tom if you play pulse you can just detect them can you yeah and iq okay but i think uh i was here you grab that johnny and then when we get to the pulse also spots nestle jack and iq specializes in spotting the react tech which is uh with grenades and stuff is there one or two there johnny on that one you can head to the next one there one there's still two somewhere well i've used one there's one left look at these peppers what the hell upstairs maybe i haven't been upstairs is there an upstairs yeah let's have a look see if we can find it oh that's where we spawned okay what's this [Music] where would it be well i don't think i'll be near the airlock because there was two over there you checked in the airlock you did yeah i found one and then one another was at the top of the stairs so i'll just double check probably this side of the map that we're at right now [Music] have you ever used the drone practically jack i've never used it once in this game no i mean either okay it's definitely not an airlock johnny i don't know i didn't like it we bumped into each other or something check the shells for a vhs three men and a baby i don't think oh yeah optimus prime what's optimus up to nowadays i don't know i don't know personally jack dude there's a transformers ride at universal studios it's sick i'm so jealous that you've done all that stuff have you not done it no covert happened yeah but before that um okay so move through to the next is there a boss on this you're gonna take me jack i'm a romantic yeah we'll go on a date thank you johnny thank you for almost killing me johnny okay this is a really long yeah it's a weird a really long airlock so hold on i'm just gonna put this stuff how would you get decontaminated like oh nice yeah jen you two say that you're not get it yourself i get it by default yeah yeah i see that got the shield next to your character yeah the little shield pops up you want to see jack frank's packs in every game i don't think that would have happened i mean we did one in f1 but it was just a battle podcast locate the seismic station it's like a uh emergency room they've got a cctv in here and you can see all the different camera angles of the map being all stealthy here that didn't sound good jack well i was being stealthy until i wasn't [Music] right i like screaming i found one here b when you found a yeah sorry you don't think so no it was a spiker there's no friendly fire these over here where's they there's the first station okay activated okay we've got one left to find will it tell us where c is no thought it will if we start it but at that point we've got to just run yeah it's better first if i go far outside of the map we'll find it that way yeah but you might get bogged down with enemies oh damn i've got like not much ammo left is that ammo anywhere i thought i've seen you okay that's the extract yeah i don't want to get too ahead of myself there's no here it's on the map isn't it what's on the map station did tell you on the map yeah right here no way jack's at one right i'm with the second one the third oh yeah see that now okay i'm going to do a then you ready do it let's go did you mark it or something johnny no it's actually turned around it's working get to the next station there's the last one you got got it i got it got it there's so many enemies on me though oh god okay do it quick and i can press it nice oh my god i'm gonna die here there's like seven enemies on me right now yeah i get it now oh they've got i'm just i'm just a normal person can we not play these machines here matty thank you for the four months man johnny and tommo great content that really is a big flashbang that's your path though thank you was that last subjective no next so someone else might as well take it i'm good i'm good yeah you take it john nothing left to pursue here can i spin this no it doesn't work oh missed opportunities oh they got far cry 3 blood dragon that was a sick expansion pack yes it was i was like the 80s theme wasn't it were like the red yeah glowing outlines and stuff i'll go see the day the earth stood still i think i've seen that movie isn't that tom no it's not tom cruise it's um keanu reeves is it oh no wow that's done this dude is horrible it's actually horrible you have to hold down f a little bit longer than tom he backed him away what's this health go for it johnny all right here we go final objective here we go for enemies oh baby boost health scoop done we're good holy spirit activate i mean there are some similarities to gtfo zachary but not many you can say that about anything yeah right now just chill because the second we start shooting like one of the green ones that's when it kicks off that's how it works where are they someone must have spied them because we got the objective [Music] that was crazy did you see where they were no ammo here i saw it it would have been a random passive spot okay here right now let's just think about this first like if we do a takedown does it yeah it's popped off chat yeah one screamed at you get him as quick as you can reload very covered what does aberrant mean there's the last one there i'll get it if you cover me oh it's got one hit i'm dead rushing towards you now from aurora i'm too hp johnny i'm dead okay that room was horrible to be in you want to close that door you're next to jack if you can't hit the button force them to go somewhere else oh you pay kills oh my god it really pops off doesn't it as soon as you hit that first green one we need to hit the one the back first thing yeah in the back i think that like the difficulty doesn't make a difference to the number of enemies it seems it's just like as you proceed as you progress through the levels you get more enemies like with each new region there's just more enemies about damn this is what i train for pain is part of the process arsenal update so we're going to get them and then we'll start alaska yeah sounds good just rush to them i thought i thought i could do that maybe but it was just way too many of them well it's because of the nest isn't it like they keep spawning until we destroy them what's up blue how are you doing man hey joaquin wall hack yeah you get a wag in this maybe try being stealthy and don't stop being stealthy that sounds like a boris johnson quote do be stealthy but don't be stunned be stealthy but only if you can be stealthy only use a suppressor if you can't use the suppressor but if you can use the suppressor don't be stealthy because if you're stealthy then you'll alert the guards but don't alert the guards unless you're being stealthy do go to a party if you don't want to give your party but only go to a party if you think it's not a party and a work event and if nobody warns you that it's a work event then tough luck i guess just don't resign but if you do resign don't resign uk politics it's not even satire is it i bet most most of the people watching the stream are american so they'll just be like what's he talking about boris john blojo what's that be google it like that's that's donald trump donald trump's brother um so easy and easy out on this one i'm going to pick a fast operator not to be sad anyone who thinks the parasite is the pinnacle of adaptive behavior hasn't seen me at work it sounds like james may reasoning [Music] in we'll say what's up straight-up gamer we know who boris is [Music] okay first objective sweet first some of objective invisible that's crazy i don't like that i gotta find the tree i mean do we want to do the whole thing or just extract the operators no no just do do the operator and then we'll move on to alaska it's uh the last phase then isn't it's first oh no way oh yeah nice yeah we gotta find a tree looking for the branches they need to be more stealthy and tactical yeah you're right but i don't think we have that capacity yeah i mean [Applause] we're more shocking yeah that's it you just got wham bam thank you man i mean we've got suppressors jack yeah three here oh there's lowe's here minnie mouse two fly through this one next time he's light up that's it isn't it i want to feel the cold well you're right jack yeah we're going to alaska born in iceland i spawned in iceland as a caveman he dropped it what the hell when i tried i stepped off they dropped her that's why mom's born in iceland offline campaign i think you can play by yourself ap yeah i don't know if it's offline though a lot of games are just permanently online now aren't they nowadays [Music] be the stealth mizzy okay we're in and out easy don't be sad it's just how it works out sometimes sometimes when we started adding the double sometimes excuse angel does sometimes that works out sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes it's sometimes but occasionally it does work out like sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes angel does it again ah angel does it again that was something right it doesn't say that seriously jack angel does it again just a mission in the back nothing it was easy it's nothing don't be sad let's just double excel sometimes yeah there was something right they're gonna just redo all the characters yeah got rid of the stupid grinny does what does he say when the round starts when he looks at the squad this is a squad i'm proud of i think i pulled something back there oh my leg right we're going to alaska i've played this this is as far as i've got san fran yeah it's just worse out sometimes tom sometimes how was the computer jack still no crashing did you play with everything yeah basically with battlefield specifically i have to underclock my gpu or it crashes i think the crash on this game is just a crash with the game evie what's cheap i just tuned in what's happening we don't know every i mean it's a parasite you're not seeing flying lights in the sky yeah you don't really know what's wrong with it tomorrow makes people's toes poor johnny listen johnny's into this he's just he's been a dad like he's our dad and i'm thomas dad and we're all having a laugh who am i the dad of you don't have a son yet oh acolyte nah acolyte's your granddad he's like he's like the mum of everyone okay acting likes mom yeah i've climbed everest it's all downhill from there did you get it doesn't mckay say something about his coffee as well yeah isn't it in that same line of dialogue no no it's a different line another cream egg jack you got cream eggs yeah i got cream egg chicken i know i've seen many eggs are back in the store this is coming up in it easter eggs so johnny is a grandpa um in that lineage yeah they sell easter eggs so far in advance isn't it weird compared to the like when they put christmas decorations out in shops yeah it's like you've got straight like six months early before easter eggs it's just because it's chocolate though isn't it so you're going to the store and you're just like well it's january but it's chocolate it's chocolate egg easter eggs are you having fun johnny always there you go see the chat were like oh i feel sorry for johnny with these two johnny's you know johnny's having a good time don't be sad don't be sad sometimes that's how it works sometimes sometimes sometimes hey that's it that's it dead me i've already had six cups of coffee today and i'm ready or something it doesn't save you or something you just put that in there i'm going to give jaeger a go tommy could have a tiny he's good against the uh a tiny fogger it's definitely hard to you know keep control anytime a care package would come in we wouldn't hear a call out from him we just turn around and suddenly he's on the other side of the map and he gets killed by someone who's also trying to go for that same care package sliding around on his knees he was always so hungry for the care packaging um a guy called fog lit that we play with sometimes oh you were always a bit of a lit spaniel yeah i've got to get the content jolly i mean yeah in a game like pop g but you die once and that's it like we just didn't have a teammate for the rest of the game it was just a gamblers whoever wanted to vote but for jack got the content that was important do you think tommy would be willing to read your bedtime stories i think if you paid him enough yeah it's me shouldn't it so i do i've got to do somebody's first just just recording that it's fine imagine if cbeebies paid me to read both bedtime stories um what like tom hardy did yeah hello i'm demographic i don't think you could do it like that i'd be like uh why did we hide this guy what's that's what that's what tomorrow's bedtime stories are like right my stomach hurts maybe i should go check that out maybe it's because i'm hungry can we get confirmation on the name of this four stuff on the ground because yes it's called slurpees it's uh orbeez it's called sprawl tom it's brawl yeah sprawl is the official term [Applause] or where it is aberrantness john do you know what the word aberrant means oh yeah but if you're gonna ask me to say what it means i can kind of use it in context so i couldn't define it and use it in context that's an operating mess of an enemy in this isn't it oh is it is it just the thing that they made up the operant's a word i think they're just an enemy rant here we go departing from an accepted standard maybe you're right diverging from the normal tabernace to the ones that are a bit more aggro and they have the green stuff coming out of them tell you what we've done there thomas we've done a look yeah we've literally come back to spawn so we'll go back down this staircase just double check this one make sure it's all right can you give me a boost here's an example tom this somewhat aberrant behavior requires an explanation so it's abnormal basically so the abnormal mess that's good it's just the posh way of saying it isn't it we haven't found them yet though i found them you found them johnny uh-huh [Music] all right now let's look at the lay of the land first and then we'll figure out the best all right i'll shoot her away what is this jack in the middle can you whack me off though it's like a claw yeah a cool person not mine um they were doing tests on the species or things we just made that up haven't you i think we can kill most of them from up for our high arm oh johnny yeah that's a good spot but we have to get the last one with melee though you have to go down and do it let's just down here well let's can we mark okay aberrant nests to open the neoplasm yeah we have to kill the green nests right yeah so how many are at the top here let's have a look i'm gonna open this sequence come on over by jack up top what you doing you've made them all angry they're all spawning chuck where have you done jack you've ruined it i'm sorry dad you you were always my dad tom oh oh i just killed myself ow your dad's never coming back no um i went to get a fire milk uh i got a shot an explosive guy and he just killed me from really far away i've ruined it for everyone i'm very sorry i'm gonna come down do you i'm sorry does it let you hold down now okay don't really come from the one direction thanks oh there's loads of explodies here guys how did you get them um i just dropped into the area sorry dad come on there's a lot of spores here as well is there another room yeah i wish i had pulse for this because we don't have anyone who can scan for them anyone there oh they're all in the ceiling up there no oh my god that's cool oh my mama it's like aliens they've been working the radius is pretty mad i can hear you come back sorry hang on i'm gonna uh just running this extraction thing real quick see if i can find it reloading oh there's no goodies in this one oh it's super cool that they're up the ceiling like that yeah hiding in the rafters it's quite easy in this area though because it's large like we've got lots of room to maneuver you know you have this smart space typically it's quite a small space isn't it i like johnny sport there um well there's four left there's one there ammunition is a bit of a problem i've seen ammo somewhere johnny reeler there was some down here but i nabbed it okay probably marked them let's take a pity on us when you get down to the last three it marks it i'm going for it oh buddy one here reload reload oh i'm dead armada burma oh no i couldn't shoot my guns when i got up after being revived by johnny here we go last one jolly can you cover i'm going to try and do it oh okay get the sample very little armor hands that come out what the hell we need to get tomorrow i'm on the way it's cheeto graphic actually you'll have to carry your squad mate to the extraction pod how do we get back up there oh you made it is this extraction pod just gonna be in the room then i don't know if you have i think you have to go all the way johnny as you can carry me to the next one but you'd have to go all the way yeah yes back away jack came this way john it's up another level i'm dean up there i don't know how you get at that yeah johnny can i score with his main gun just i've got 20 in that so change weapons [Music] i don't know how you get up there there's another oh is that stairs there that looks like stairs there guy to your right maybe no i'll be here this way but you're going towards the okay yeah the extract so we can save you i thought you're going to the airlock he's in easier now we'll get you out and we'll restart so we can all do it is this the first level yeah yeah that's you can carry on oh no i don't mean johnny could do it we need probably why did he turn into a cheeto because that's the game i know they do the same if it were you have you never turned into a cheetah in real life oh yeah i always forget about the bug many people do johnny it's an easy thing to forget yeah he does look like a what's it as well to be honest maybe more like what's going on like we don't really have cheetos but they're not like a massive thing i would say always grab water cheetos in the uk yeah definitely but in the us now cheetos are more popular also like things that are in the us that get bought over to the uk are never as tasty because we always strip back the ingredients some stuff's illegal well it's fda isn't it like yeah a vote to replay guys at the bottom should just put us in sure it's a very big cheese though yeah cheetah graphic i like that that's good hey lucas what's up what i said jack would you ever listen to me cheeto graphic that's good what the hell is this game it's rainbow six extraction you don't know what a what's it is it's oh it's more like a knick-knack someone who said knick-knack nicknames i haven't loved those uh chicken triple uh no like that you know the snack though is it or like refrigerators they do a katsu one that's quite nice i had it recently out of the christmas one a christmas one chicken and stuffing it was nice do you think when i know they say on the packet it's like real chicken breasts do you believe them i do okay reformed for your convenience i think you can tell you can taste the chicken i'm gonna go pulse this time because it seems like finding those nests is good well we might get different objectives huh we might but you know it's always a gamble you think an actual prep phase would be good for this jack like a tabletop look down at them no i don't think it's necessary it gives you your objective so you can plan like this i just threw you into a prep phase at this point you're on raw heads we're gonna okay so we've got an elite target a biopsy and a gateway a gateways boss oh my god [Music] yeah all right let's try and sneak okay do the one thing we're really bad at really good at we've got spores on me we've got to find the allies though the elites oh that was close you had goo on you spanking him got him man i'll snag that and we've got a shotgun shotguns no yeah gone through there can't we through the trapdoor kill this boxing there it is i can hear him down here okay that one almost got alerted there yeah i got him just in time yeah this is full release it's out now guys came out on the 20th i think there's a recharge here yesterday it is on game pass as well if you want to check it out and if you're worried your buddies can't play it there's a phase where you get to play with them despite owning the game yourself there's a buddy pass there you have it the last one's right in front of me got him just stabbed him in the face i'm gonna go pro this game where's the elite target uh he's probably upstairs we have to find it i don't think he's in this [Music] good job tom battle league was changing its mind about rallying others what's the health here guys we need it for the boss [Music] whatever it is well fnatic are going to sign you up on those yeah yeah a fanatic montage [Music] i mean it definitely is a lot easier when you're stealthier it is actually it's because of the nests though like if you you can aggro and just kill the nets along the way there's three health kits somewhere guys what there's three in the level here should we go find them yeah there's there's another two now yeah we should have a load i've got poles so i can see you see where the boxes are yeah see if you can find them oh spiker please nests here i reckon there's got to be a med game over there yeah there's one here and then there's one more somewhere it's aliens not zombies yeah it's aliens js yeah that's right it's not zombies uh there's one over there johnny oh no it's not what you need the nest above me i think i'm scanning with my pulse iq is definitely better there she's got more range if you keep playing his pulse you get further range with the ability there's an advancement did we go in here performing i don't know where this last one is yeah should we just go through the next one yeah let's uh decontaminate the maps aren't procedurally generated mason but the enemies and the nests and everything else is and the objectives that's the replayability tom it's right here just run right past it wow i mean who's taking it me i guess yeah yeah that makes sense onwards i've got my boost as well i feel like i should save it for the boss though yeah for the bathroom although there was a gadget you can do that and then can i so you need to wait for it to expire okay yeah you're right there we go that's a nice way to get some health back one screamed yet yeah i don't think it's that type of game although there could be a jump scare that's not the button i want to press jack wait yeah i got no i like what's happened there though that's good there you go does this when you're trying to figure out you're going slow does it require you to run around in circles well yeah you go like this i can imagine you're like just trying to find the one i've got with eight shots whilst i'm it's just habit you know from playing war zone and stuff just like walking around in a spot which burn did you want what's on the screen i pressed it it was stone screaming i didn't hear it yeah no that didn't come through just kill them with your reaction the sample's broken then there we go that's the bbc i mean [Music] yeah i got this one all right what's the fitbit no i got about four inches myself combo came over i've got to kill kill this lad i keep telling her no i didn't read i thought we had to kill him wait did we just first all of them yeah we did we ruined it instantly i had pulse for this reason jack right next objective all right let's go do the boss yeah i'd rather focus on seeing the new areas to be honest and just restarting when we fell on the objective that pinned it off it was entirely your fault we're gonna go do the boss that's that was the problem skip through the objectives and get to the boss off the boss there's a glowing light in the sky well it just instantly blinks away yeah i mean there are there is one med kit can you see there's another one here i'm scanning about yeah it did have a big cross on it i just completely neglected what was in front of my eyes this is what happens when we just like talk rubbish yeah bomb to me now the crawly one that i hear is coming i don't see this nothing left to do here but there's more in the next nothing left to do here you've ruined it oh god spiker please why are you so tanky who's this guy you got a tanky lad like a really tanky spiker i'm fighting right now i'd be one of the guys that we have to get a biopsy from oh yeah [Music] we won't get him next time you're still trying to find the med kit yeah i think we should just go i'm taking more damage trying to find it then all right let's have a look in here just quickly hey what's that no summer teletubbies come out to play [Music] stinky winky [Music] fingers abilities unlimited use on cooldown that banned episode the teletubbies with the dog and the light all the the line and why was it banned i remember it was a light it was like a lion and it was a bear they were like it was like a lion and a bear on wheels and it was like terrifying for kids really yeah so they banned the episode you still see it on youtube but it is creepy as hell so it wasn't the it was just the fact that the content was scary yeah like it was like they had like these like wooden like a wooden bear and a wooden lion that were on like wheels and like riding over the hill just like stood up with really creepy faces and making really scary noises but why and then they tried to re they tried to redo the episode and like re-dubbed it and kids were still terrified so they just end up banning it i need to see this that was like a big news story a while ago okay we have to get to the gateway this one like kill an enemy on the point no this is a boss we have to go through the pool oh yeah fun yeah but we didn't beat the last boss so maybe we can do this right come to me guys i mean should we have a look around for stuff before we leave i think it's too late now i don't know do you guys need to activate it as well yeah activate it okay here we go did i just go down as i went through how i heard my character hello andrew what's up keith let's go welcome dark side thank you for tuning in guys if you're enjoying the stream do consider hitting that like button thank you no you're not dead tom good what's the wobbling that's going i've gotten mad getting some ammo up here uh here sounds like a similar gun we'll find out now brooke oh no he's on the line [Music] i just know by the sound of that gun behind me we need to stick together guys we can't do anything can we when they've got i don't know i think we have to kill the clones when they've got armor though we can't what do you mean i'm just calling that already dude [Music] i'm dead surely what is happening i don't understand it's quite confusing this boss isn't it i never know which one's real you get a boost is there a way to tell which one's real well you have to just track her because you'll see the ones that's real that's real real yeah now they've got the shield back because if you duplicate it there you go the main one there that's the real one no it's not what the hell so confused not taking damage oh it's just warped into me oh that's a clone oh i get it the one that you can't penetrate is the real one so you have to kill the clones before you can kill them on the silence i'm just i got chipped flashing for the res that's the real one in the corner i think i'm beaming and i'm beaming don't get the rest get the result he's johnny dead he's dead the i wish this game had tiered reloads oh it does kind of so [Music] maybe this area tom there's a little head glitch we could use i don't know yeah maybe on the stairs [Music] or reinforce i did a lot of damage there to the real one i think i'm reloading doing the thing down here some yeah i'm killing anybody [Music] we can do this we can do this table flash is in that corner still that's a clown isn't it another flash i've got to reload some reloading oh my god i'm so surrounded reloading again you good i think so [Music] oh now [Music] ten seconds and i can do my thing [Music] oh she blasted me away oh we got this is that it tom here there you are this one this one dead yes oh my god i was watching that i still have no idea which one you were meant to kill oh my god you can kind of tell yeah that'll complete the mission for us awesome it's like an auto complete look at that very strange of things i'd like to see some of the other bosses just yeah same one twice anyway smoke would be difficult to play against okay this is as far as i see you stream jack kind of spoilers yeah yeah i mean you're welcome to leave i don't think you can really spoil this game though like it's small it's like it's like seeing spoilers for a call of duty map oh call ross here we go here's some real intelligence each time you defeat a boss you get some of their loot so you might have some alibi headgear uniform or charmer maybe some from smoke from yesterday okay thank you ross thanks ross thanks ross appreciate you thanks ross it's good looking right movement speed increased by 30 percent yeah let me look at some of my prayers before we skip see advancement a way to go with you that can improve our chances of achieving objectives in the hot zones i see block the charm [Music] the strong arm four new entries i think is in general let me get these three here hey alex what's up everyone say thanks to ross in the chat do i have my yeah i'll drop two codes two codes in the chat

what's up man other guy jack are you going to play insurgency again it gives me heart attacks and adrenaline every time i play it yeah definitely yeah i got an arkey and chibi alibi you're a chibi yeah that's a charm you should have it jack um is that in operators if you click the weapon and then click the settings like to change your attachments right uh i don't know i've got it on mp7 for jaeger right now yeah that's right yeah you got it that's cool i mean you can't really tell that's alibi i mean it just looks like a mess contaminate isn't she you woke up with a bad hair day no that's a really bad hair day andy jawbreaker oh do i haven't had one of those for years bro there's a little dog as well i got tachanka nice the jungle okay um was that the was that euridis valley or was that orpheus research center um was that the first to the second one in alaska that was the same second believe that was the second it was looking at that like satellite thing in the middle i'm pretty sure that's what we were fighting but he didn't look up don't look up now streaming i need to watch that movie have you watched it no i need to watch it i haven't watched it it's uh it's it's mid mid to no all right we're gonna do the gnome come and rush to see it you know there's no g hundred percent should we try severe difficulty just for a laugh come on let's give it a go that boss on severe is not going to end well hopefully we don't get that bus again any war zone streams coming up jack um maybe i mean i don't want to promise any because they delayed season two so there's not much new stuff at the moment so this is the third difficulty wait wait some people are saying it was the first was it guys the one we just did was at the second or first mission in alaska i've got the memory of a sieve so we've played two on the floor then jack jack was that the first or second johnny yes no as johnny said yeah he said yes but that's not useful though is it i tried to help i thought we were inside the satellite thing any more codes yeah i think we've got a few more left maybe three quick maths quake mass what are we doing we're doing this one i'm just thinking i'm just trying to get a confirmation in the chat if you can get one yeah yeah let's get back on the stream wow youtube streaming incredible wow you can do that twitch now as well i think i think it was the first actually no it was the second round it was the first rewind rewind i'm getting mixed messages here guys most people are saying second so i don't know all right we did the first one there tomography check in confirm deny checking please hold caller as johnny would say go full stealth good try i think it was the first because we spent so long in we failed didn't we [Music] what do you reckon tom i see the point that you choose the level i just don't remember the giant ball you know um wait what was the first one called something valley right you you serious we've done that one so we've we're on to the third now okay so we've just completed the second and we're on to the third sweet okay you asked to be done i said yes you didn't believe me definitely makes messages in chat i believe jackson's or the second to which you responded with yes yes have we done the first and the second yeah i said yes yes no that's true actually the second yeah but i asked which one we did and it was yes if you'd have said have we done the first and the second then yes we'll answer that question but the fact you said first or the second the answer is yes yes you just got to accept the answers yes right all right yeah no we haven't done this okay stealthy there's a plane now let's crash look come on there's a plane there that's crashed can you see it over there johnny did you see that can't have their leaders or containment will be near impossible kill a few to promote the elite oh what they we have to kill this lad this is not stealth you literally feel like you've got a shotgun like what do you want me to do keep it quiet be like stealth there's another one dead right last one easy mode oh where is it i'm looking for him there with me is he in here oh wait wait guys the modifier is really bad because now the sloppy stuff damages you if you stand on it it's if you look down it's great i've killed him all three done did you hear what i was saying tom i don't know sorry i was it's very loud in that building this lovely stuff now damages you if you stand on it oh the score yeah it's green now so just be careful oh why would we want that it's just a modifier we got unlucky look at it though jack yeah it's green but look look closely actually moves like ripples yeah sloppy like uh like a slow bow jesus this is not a good start for us guys my lord this he actually leaves the slope on the floor that's a problem yeah moves like ripples it's gross i'm one hp so if you if i touch it i'm just gonna die right i'll just get hit by a spiker oh my god both of us here i'm stuck in this i'm moving all right i self-revive johnny's up all right extraction start again i mean no we did it we did it yeah but look at our health if we kill the nests we can find more health this is a really bad modifier as well and we're on severe contract we're still like we're still our operators are still going to be low on health yeah but do you think we might as well you think we can survive this time yes i believe in us and if we die then the operators die only phase one right so let's kill a spore are you actually wanting to extract it wasn't a it was a historical question was it jack do you think we can survive this tom starts extract why is looking at me calling for extraction platform okay i'm gonna try this again we're just staring at you for that's what me and johnny do you know it's just like there wasn't a word for both of you that was absolutely the right decision from teamspeak that was the right decision tom operates good look it's good xp anyway because we did the first objective for our operators on their last legs yeah but we just played different ones are we i want to sledge prove it well you could be such again tom you just smash your doors might die all right vote for replay then yeah but it's a replay then yeah god why did we distract tom why are you so true you just always want to leave a nightmare i'm a nightmare to work with absolute man god i really believe we can do this tom yes i do and then just near a word johnny are literally on the platform two minutes turn around you both got helicopter symbols okay rescue it's good first one shut down what is that carry explosive to target we've not done that yet mm-hmm it doesn't look like that when you're playing the explosive quick bit then oh wait no maybe we haven't done this one i'm thinking of the third one the sabotage thing there i believe we have done shut down all right well i guess i'm not playing sledge farmer that lasted 50 seconds one hp isn't he i got four health oh my god i'm gonna be i'm gonna be stopping doc let's go okay confirm loadout i've got my suppressor on there gg no ree thanks for playing see you atlan this is weird energy vibes going on matthew that's just how it is with us i'm sorry there's no such thing as there's no such thing as weird kind of in the energy limbo yeah we just flow we flow so like you know most people like flow through time but time flows through us yeah we're being stealthy yes oh it's spawned us elsewhere listen if we alert the guards here they kill the hostage so we do actually need to be stealthy okay just a flashbang play some worse could happen nice that was stealthy is that okay you're taking that bit literally there tom steel think of me i'll let him pass good game wish i had friends sorry to hear that man you can live vicariously through us okay i think this is the stealthiest we've ever been right now and this is good keep your voice down we don't have to role play like that i'll hear us let's grab this hostage i'm picking you up get the package to the extraction point what is that walked on what are you doing that looks so stupid that's pretty normal here how about this think about this i've never thought about life that way before no your asset she's in goodbye harriet nice knowing you why are you trying to kill her what the where these guys come from i don't know you just spawned out oh that's all the way today okay next objective this is cool don't worry it is yeah i like the snow parts look we've done that without taking a single bit of damage apart from john uh thomas no i didn't take any damage well why is your health did you start on that um um you lying actually i don't know let's be honest must have taken it health down here tomorrow yeah get down get the health it's gone no i didn't take any health on that that's right yeah that just takes in front of me i didn't take any health takes help that's what me and me mates do while drunk and doing the train gang what's train gang what does that mean a snake in florida remember pub g when we did this or just did a snake in the line about this you thought about this sorry come on curious serious stuff go there we're being very stealthy good luck at the top of there though there's some spores in front of me wait the train is paused okay continue hi kev pause i may have fired a loud weapon there without realizing it hold that nest next to you i've got a spore on me tom oh my god whack me quick got it nice oh no it's a crawler oh no no you have a wave crawlers as well johnny so it's fine fifty thousand people used to live here nice it goes down is that one armored or something well though you have to kill the spore around it let's thrive on the spool it's a special armored nest okay there we go very good oh get behind him nice johnny johnny's really committed to this i love this love that energy johnny am i like lying on my back donny please we're on youtube it's not funny am i lying on my back yeah on my front on your back how's this look it's normal [Music] no although to be honest that's an impressive piece of animation work there yeah but you roll as well there if i do this do i roll on my belly you just did a 360. okay you're not rolling tom wait stealth stealth stealth please stealth stealth be quiet come on this is hardest difficulty we're doing really well just the third hardest isn't it um well yeah but i can't pick the fourth hardest yet so hardest difficulty at the moment technically that was a politician wasn't it technically yeah carry the injections then yeah they'll stop through that show might make you feel good but disabling a nutrient sick gamers this game is like 20 times easier i've gone mad wow he's absolutely riddled me if you go stealthy it just is easy just stabbing everything in my path nutrient mode we need to find the injectors we need to kill this lad first because he's a problem here he is here he is getting somewhere where's he going what are the injectors in these things i don't know i think it's that yellow thing over there oh i know what it is you take the tube out of the out of the react capsule thing oh yeah there's three of these carry one each the eight come get one johnny got the back i heard this arresting that's it i said johnny look lovely the foam injector move to the obj look at the crash plane my vote for here there's enemies in here though yeah go stealth stealth sounds lucky um hey easy peasy what's up is that it does it explode now you get more good well played it worked nests won't be regrowing here for a while there's one med kit somewhere johnny might need that although i could just do that no more easter eggs do you think in the distance probably do you want to try and find this medkit or just go to the next bit uh i think we lose more health trying to find them don't we watch out for this guy watch out for this guy ouch charlie charlie [Music] oh i need that ammo actually jesus i don't know what this is but he doesn't look friendly he's that teleport dude smashing him in the face he teleports through the spool got him he's dead reacting should i get that yes sir yeah easter eggs easter eggs hello what about the light shoot the light yeti raw okay good good objective two done what's the last one sabotage okay usually we're pretty good at sabotage so yeah we're pretty great at that specialty you should be all right broke the hat but you just break these things hey james what's up lenny why can't everybody be like johnny it's a question that we all have to ask ourselves i've got a copyright he's yeah he's copyrighted uh if you do that johnny on location i did that first siege is a pbb yeah well siege is a pvp game but this isn't stealthy stealthy foundation for the parasite to adapt find those spine things that's the spot plant the charges and defend the site until they detonate nice johnny nice you can still melee that jack nice stab through the armored ones but you can't shoot them okay nice fish down here there's a big fish down here is there oh nice had to shoot him in his purple head tom yeah i went for the run around to stab him in the ass john he's got an nft on his name yeah there's nfc profile pages and i can't right click save as with johnny oh yes it's so satisfying what was that um operator called where you could like when someone was down you get the knife and you interrogate them yeah is it rivera oh dude when she came out that's all i would play incredible so funny not pissed off better like characters in her game i've got so many like great uh vids on youtube with like highlights of her likewise you're going to plant that second one no i'm just going to look at it philip loin block steak i didn't know that high quality customized cuts for our customers say that when you're drunk i don't i don't even know what he said but i couldn't repeat it yeah exactly i don't think you i said drunk you're sober jack and you still failed good that these are in the same place shoot this stuff around it because the enemies run faster towards the objective pro tips with tomographic just using my brain yeah i don't know often but when i do it's a great success great success what this mp7 caveira was amazing yeah is still a good operator though she got nerfed a couple of times yeah she was pretty overpaid when the game the interrogation revealed everyone for like quite a long time but there was a skill to it you know get behind an enemy without making a sound i think shed like basically had like dead silence when you activated her ability yeah you walked faster and crouched right so it wasn't completely silent though no you could hear like a faint like as well oh we done this full fading away second is that all three objectives here boys severe difficulty as well come on we've done one there we smashed that is johnny your imaginary friend i'm pretty sure he's real this is a food production several times and i've known him since i was about 15. could be him could be imaginary can you guys hear him tom can you hear johnny um no oh i actually can't johnny you speaking he's my man he's real he's well confirmed oh he is real yeah but that's that's the kind of thing that someone who's imaginary would say yeah but i'm also part of your imagination if you notice jack and i never speak at the same time well that's true actually that's just called having a conversation i've never spoken at the same time as johnny ever that would never happen ever are you just speaking over yourself you're deliberately trying to speak over me i like that idea jack needs a moat to merge that says be like johnny i've never seen that before he's actually coming to pick us up it's a really big thing here um yes indeed why that never happens okay okay weird did someone not hit the ready up thing do we wait the whole extraction time they're at i think maybe because it was severe difficulty it spawned something maybe the massive lad at the end the big lad just turns about nowhere boom takes the guy out in two seconds don't extract but do extract johnny is imaginary so is tommo that isn't right though because you wouldn't be able to hear them i can't turn my imagination into a live stream it's a simulation johnny is what you're saying jack doesn't post videos to youtube i'm really feeling disconnected now that's living in the metaverse and he doesn't realize it like actually lives in 2052. are we all in the metaverse so according to uh mr facebook true that was a good agreement with you i would agree with you because i'm a figure forgive your imagination okay i'm also illiterate okay rewards oh yeah i've got the 417. that's sick is it the dmr yeah i think so i don't know how useful that would be in this game though you know like a suppressor on it probably be quite good for the big boys mid-range targets for sure what i got inactive from that sorry i think it went inactive after that why she just tired gone to a quick nap have you tried alibi yet her decoys are really fun think monkey bombs from cod zombies you know what i don't think i've actually played as alibi yeah you create a decoy of yourself and then the enemies are attracted to that and they just start punching it bit of you level 9. [Music] what's up jesse i'm good thank you how are you jesse cook time to cook stay out of my territory and you think that of me i am the one who knocks i'm nearly level 11. when i get to 11 we can try the last area have you heard of do you watch uh ozark jack i've seen the first two episodes of it but um i never finished it but connor's like battering me to finish it because he really loves that show but the fourth season comes out today but it's i've never heard a show of a show do this before netflix have released the first seven episodes of season four the final season and it's it's season four part one and then season four part two is coming in it's tbc like what it's not it's not an announced date but people are saying like before the end of 2022 okay but it's still season four is that the last season the final season yeah but what why would they not release it like week to week if they were going to do that it seems weird that they've split the season into two sets of seven maybe they haven't finished filming it because they're called or something i don't know but yeah it's like the old rider strike they did yeah there's a break but it's just like part one and part two of a for one season because usually i think ozark is ten episodes but this one the first part of it is seven it's totally fourteen okay but it doesn't it doesn't actually end on on episode 7 of the first part of the fourth season tom i'm confused just listening to you i have to be honest i'm confused that that's the easiest way of explaining it and it's still confusing is it so i'm not sure if we actually did this mission or not but we're going to see i was so excited he's like oh yeah don't wait to watch season four so yeah you're gonna have to wait quite a few months before we can finish it just edging their fans essentially alibi apparently i have played alibaba before all right let's see let's do stealthy again i'm nearly level 11. so if we complete this one got a shotgun have you got a pistol with a suppressor i've got a pistol with the suppressor yeah i'll be all right i'll make it work johnny you can make anything work what do you say that so seductively because he's a seductive man in my head hmm well yeah i suppose he's a figure of imagination um do you recognize this it could be whatever you want it to be if we play this well this is the one that i wasn't sure if we played or not we played it uh mr century thank you for the six months when's your setup video soon i need to get around to filming it all center i've done a little bit of it have we played this kill or assist killing stun tormentors destroy torment projectiles you can destroy those damage torment so basically i have to torment the team you can destroy him with uh jager you see an operator that destroys projectiles yeah okay well the ghosts are here so they've got rabbits uh easter egg here graffiti though where i mean in the arcade oh yeah that's cool i don't remember this his head's there as well no actually i don't remember this look at this is it a game yeah it's like we haven't played this high fighter i'm going to start this up oh big lad got a soft spot in the back that you need to stab him in or shoot him in summoning him out nope i've smoked him oh yeah i mean that was light work there i was jumped on his back and stuck a knife in his please refer to thomos setup video for inspiration i don't remember what you did tom you did i was thought mine was quite me me does it matter you watched it it was like over a year ago though right yeah yeah i remember that i don't know a year ago maybe it's gonna do the full office desk setup jack or just a pc just and i lay down on my standing desk and hit the button and rizz i mean i have told them before that really there's not much in my my offices blooming spikers like it's literally a big room with a desk and two computers and then some crap at the back yeah but you could i could say that about my own self i said i went to my house it was just interesting to see how you work and what equipment you use because yes sir i just got to be inspired by you jack and they want to know what equipment why would anyone be inspired to touch yourself useless i mean did you see it don't worry sad video apparently you put months into that there was 56 additional sound effects in that video well you could tell i loved it i loved when thank you tom i appreciate i just love the added sound effects and you're running everyone over there's a cat on the left classic cat screech was brilliant molson thank you for the four i've obviously never heard of changed the bypass of the sound effect when it was running past you or was it just um there was a couple of like running sound effects yeah there was lots of panning sound like it was coming out yes nice i did that for like all of the sound effects pretty much they weren't central i need to get behind him an assassin maybe okay oh my god tom yeah this is hardest difficulty so he's just ruined dude yep one hit from 62 hp to nothing i'll cover there you go thank you for coming you kept your feet does johnny have a channel no he doesn't oh my god get behind him now oh my god yes johnny i'll be on johnny's channel if he had one he smacked me so far away i need ammo i think there's some here yeah no johnny doesn't have a channel but you can't find me on jack frank's channel there you go that's his channel he's a side character on the jackpot channel you can also find him in one tomographic video which one was when we played the uh zombies event in warzone ages again that's a while ago apparently i only play zombie type games yeah this is a it's johnny's uh speciality so what we got we've got one more ammo thing one more health couple of tech as well come back come up got spores on there nice reload you're getting the intel we need are we done in here yeah we are done unless you want to uh okay jack yeah i could deal with that is that in the airlock yeah yeah thank you do i need react attack yes i do actually hey leno what dimensions is my monitor 27 inch payload i also have 27. likewise yeah it's good like you've got something yeah i bought it i didn't get sent it all right i think stock got this one yeah i bought it because todd recommended it a couple years ago okay yeah it was when we both got sent for like some weird hp stealthy again if we go now uh yeah sure oh here's the satellite room sick that's really cool yeah okay the level design is quite nice in this game isn't it interesting pretty unique to siege seems uh plausible despite the mental aliens that are running around screeching us well i didn't kill you okay um is there anything we can barricade johnny first oh well i've done it now you're doing it okay it's too early sorry close this here you go we barricade that no we can't oh you can't do the wall next to what oh you can do this here 240 hertz bacon chrome am i going to watch the lord of the rings series of course greg yeah that's going to be awesome apparently it's the most expensive tv show ever made really where's the second one sorry oh johnny's planted it already yeah we need to attack his wife no the i'm looking for the other one tom what because johnny had already done it it wasn't on the ui that's what he was in bounds oh johnny playing the one downstairs we stood next to this one i was trying to figure out where this one was the objective okay because it was planted it wasn't revealing anymore boy hate that guy i'm gonna break this down i don't know what's happening when i'm stuck okay stuff are you good step right step bro what's fine here have you got a grenade storm i'm all right what the hell that's not ideal okay i've got one i got one i broke the door here i think he's i fell through a trap hold it it's my decoy johnny it could excuse me i'll take that much it's me did you try and choose it no i was confused as to why you were up and down at the same time because it was in the smoke how did it look real okay there's three med kits those routers absolutely ruin us yeah i got stuck for like a few seconds yeah there were four of them downstairs it seemed that was quite the problem i'm just going to check in here to see if there's med kits we're getting to go through there anyway there's another two though so we should find them unless they're down here let me check no there's none down here outside there i am oh yeah he's grease fire spores at me ah [Music] you're far away son please call man where is it right now you got spores on you tom yeah can you cut them off thank you big lad hold on if i put a d point there will he go for it maybe he will maybe he won't i got him that's really really good for that yeah that's good you could just decline straight away um there's one more in the level mr jhs for the two lord of the rings series even more expensive than teletubbies yes definitely no question man i'm getting hungry the spores make you hungry all this slime everywhere as well although all the cheeto people reacting there's one somewhere see if we can find it i feel like i've been everywhere though i don't know we check every outside um i didn't check outside that much no i just killed the big guy and run back in i could eat okay yeah i bring some snacks man oh yeah there's quite a few enemies up here it's definitely not downstairs gotta be here somewhere where i am a bunch of guys let's go to pick up your decoys again you pick i mean i know you can pick them up in the main game i didn't know you could do it in this well i don't remove functionality from you in this game they add it in here it's not in here walls are on me anyone nearby no yeah oh nice there's a bad guy in here oh my god there's more first of all my front door i'll make it here there we go we found it how did i meet johnny i mean we're all at five hp uh count we went to the land together uh yeah gwen um please have on the healthcare how do we do this jack all right that's fine savage absolutely savage but it's not here to play no games yeah johnny uh was part of the wow game and starts talking about this different conversation it's just like and i was friends with some of the people in the wow girl that we ended up to go into a land together and just ignore me and johnny just ignored tomographic because he was at the land as well so we uh we did actually i walked up to them and introduced myself and they forgot my name said hello i'm tommy graffy at the time and you were like 12 maybe yeah that's right how old are you hi guys uh i watch your uh vimeo content no because we youtube wasn't even a thing then yeah but vimeo was vimeo wasn't the thing then it wasn't was it it was just like tv yeah what ebounds were what you want justin.tv thing is we did actually stream the line oh break.com break rememberbreak.com that was legendary you remember funny junk yeah what is that why is it screeching why is it dropping my firing things don't worry um no can't assassinate if you're getting the proximity she blasts you away i've got the annoying one that's new what the hell's that if we are being hammered right now just so you know no don't go down absolutely smashed pinned are these nests are angry as well dude i shot smashed i need to hold it longer than you think you need to going down jack oh we're dead no way mission failed got escalated oh yeah that went rapidly downhill please ignore me in that line that's why yeah i've teamed up with the enemy [Music] yeah we used to get dominoes doing it then yeah i remember yeah i told him you were there yeah used to follow you remember where it was as well tom yeah it was down in on that street wasn't it it was on the street in that building in the building yeah it wasn't yeah you go through the door yeah you went through the door pizza well they were they didn't sell pizza there tom did they you may have been confused where we got the pizza from you can't lean yeah you can lean kendrick but we don't really lean what's the point dude andrew bring back rogue spear i used to play rogue spirit all the time roxbury was sick it was one of the i think it was the second rainbow six game wasn't it i'm not quite level 11 i think that was my first our new operators i like the ghost recon games back in the day as well oh ghost for econ was sick yeah it was more like it was bigger missions wasn't it it was open rainbow six was very tight and intimate yeah ghost recon was much more like outside definitely um we'll try that one again but i think we'll do it cautious i just want to see what this looks like at the end crispy guy jackie the only streamer i watch great content thank you crispy you should watch some of graphic as well and johnny if he

planning phase where you could pick what your ai would do you would draw like way points on the map and say okay go to that door kick it in go to that door yeah flash bang it and then you could
