hi guys and welcome to more bf5 today we are playing breakthrough on wake island i thought i'd go with a sniper as soon as i'm playing on the japanese i've gone with the arasaka let's shoot some heads it's gonna be pretty not sure bad start there either they taken b i'm sorry how was that i missed oh he was dead okay got the suppression assist i missed sniping in this game so good oh this gun's really satisfying as well i don't think i even maxed it out you know i think it's like level eight or something i've not really played much breakthrough on the bf5 version of wake island it's a conquest might benefit classic bf 1942 conquest map but breakthrough i guess it could be interesting a little wookie in the bush sir oh yeah i was behind that cover come on thank you face the truth i'll face your truth if you're not careful is that a threat does that even mean anything i don't think so oh he slid into that one didn't he i love the sight on this though it's cool hang on i can hear silence peepees over here something's going down here can we actually push on to this point it was that's absolute dirt oh i'll tell you what boys i am loving it nope let's fall back i'm going into health up here aren't i oh thanks they cleared that maybe how we doing over here oh that's an enemy isn't it move over there is secondary some planes coming in as well very nice oh come on someone's got to get him now i hit him he spotted we've held on to the points as well hello i'm a bit dubious that they're just behind us now yeah it's almost like being a bush rocky works right i was looking at this website that was linked on reddit called battlefield agency and it tracks the player numbers on the server browser and bf5 had like 20 000 concurrents on pc which is really good it's highest it's been in ages and uh that'll be even higher on console with xbox game pass and stuff so games quite popular at the moment also i don't know if you guys caught my video on warzone yesterday but i've changed a few settings on my mouse i'm running 1600 dpi now and i've reduced my in-game sensitivity to make sure it's the same as what it was before it just feels a lot more responsive now and that was based on a video that battle nonsense made where you pretty much proved that if you have a higher dpi and higher mass frequency a thousand hertz 1600 dpi you have less input lag and i'm all about that it's taking me a little while to get used to it because the mouse definitely feels different but i do feel a bit more connected to the game so i'm going to stick with it what is going on over here for one of those bad boys in the sky maybe some rats around here weren't there plane just bombed a few people found that head there there's steve rogers or whatever he's called is it steve rogers it's steve something brother looks like tom cruise basically oh come on we're better than that we are better than that [Applause] apparently not tell you what the sarasack it's actually sick this gun the tank is hiding in there look got covered man are they all dead yeah i think well this is kind of good though we've pushed them off the point kind of get back now put my spawn beacon down in case we get pushed here they are ransacking this right side what guns that guy got looks dangerous i don't know i want to push this right side though could i steal no i couldn't because that's out of bounds i kind of want to steal it that was close then got my head chopped off there by the tank what if i chill here like this and watch that right i think they're gonna push this lane ow that right side didn't really get us anywhere did it so see how the left works out here i think they're quite pushed up here right i feel like they are they're taking able oh my god [Applause] i think nope that's me out there i'm gone i'm gone i was about to get plastered then wasn't i oh hello look at these lads going around the back what are they up to oh no he's gonna get he's gonna get the flank where did he go through that tunnel that's a problem so a little gap there you can hide in yeah there is oh no i've got to try and get this guy don't i [Music] [Laughter] hey we're trying to hide there that's the tank shooting are they there's captain bird's eye again living the dream trying to sell his frozen fish fingers to everyone but he can't because there's a war on it's not possible captain bozei you've got to win the war first and then you can start to accrue profit oh no we're losing it we're losing it quite fast as well damn they must be all over that [Applause] are they oh they're at the back here let's have a go a couple guys here so what one more yeah we got a triple kill let's go that was my challenge right there get all those people that are spotted we did it we did it give me some hills yeah we did we pushed him back there retreat i love that no medic here isn't it tricky little medic there little medic careful uh okay how am i not dead steve steve steve please oh no steve i told you to stop oh god oh god oh that was close that was close i think the support player killed him the tank was about to mince me oh god no steve why is it always you he just can't stop himself you guys been watching one division by the way though that's that's fire i love that it started off a bit weird didn't it but then episode three you're like okay i get it now and then it's just got better and better and better it's just like watching a really long marvel movie brilliant makes me look forward to all the other you know potential marvel series that they're gonna do are you shooting at me why are you shooting at me stop that can i rest oh you've been raised by someone else come on reload it i want a kill there's someone right there on there medic here damn it smoke getting in the way oh they took it me i need to watch my back man i'm missing it didn't even realize they were capping it i felt like the whole team just got that call says just dominating everyone he just killed all these people i wish i was a medic there 44-1 there you go that's the problem with the planes in battlefield games right now this is quite a good point to snipe from what if i look down here [Applause] steve oh come on that was my plane yes thank you rob all right here we go we get another chance behind us now oh god look at them they're all around us like rats need to go pro hide in the grass i'll never see me i put some ap rights there if i do that as well i don't like these smokes i'd rather these smokes weren't here so i could just dodge that rocket snipe people like this that's what i want steve oh my god captain bird's eyes got the plane thrower he's cooking up those fish fingers he's cooking him up mission fail we'll get next time what that he was in a truck just got blown up i'd love to be able to go up there it's out of bounds though [Applause] oh no alright here we go [Applause] that's a wide one oh i just missed nearly caught me in the side of the face we're losing b [Applause] keep running keep running oh how was that not a headshot i could only see the dude's head want to reload reload there's a guy here there's one here i think one of those was the cloud wasn't it yes oh man i love the sniping in this game it's brilliant we're equal on a look captain bird you're not captain birds you're not allowed to use the pleasure look at him such a baller just balling out of control just trying to sell his fish fingers during a world war as well of all things now that's how committed to his craft captain bursa is ow where's me where's me no you fall down where's me where's me where's me got to kill steve yes i didn't see where you came from but thank you so much i appreciate that i'm going to bash this into the sky like that that's going to reveal everything to me there's a guy right here i'm gonna hit him with the i don't want to throw a knife oh god tanks it's tanks then it's tanks then i think our tank won i think it yeah it did come on yes yes go over here no cut down in my prime unforgivable you gotta stop being so prone guys that's almost the jumping headshot that would have been perfect well they've still not managed to take the points despite all their efforts and big explosions i think that was our rocket to be fair i think we've got this one in the bag you know a really fun game i should play a breakthrough some more shouldn't i it's actually quite fun with a sniper oh no i'm not going to get that one so i'll tell you we started coming in as well we get it i think we got it hey there we go gg how did we do 62-10 tried to keep up with the bombers but i think we beat the one on the other team yeah our bomber went 81-11 though [Music] or was it this guy i don't know anyways there it is thank you for watching guys arasaka's a beast isn't it it's really satisfying to use as well did we level it up we got it to level 10 and we did a storyline note which i just simply couldn't care about thank you
