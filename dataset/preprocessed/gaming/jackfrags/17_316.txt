so for the last few days i've been playing warzone on controller a couple reasons really i just wanted to try something a bit different challenge myself and maybe actually get better on the sticks because i haven't really dedicated any serious time to controllers since halo 3 and before that it was golden eye on the nintendo 64. there was only one analog stick on that thing so maybe not the best place to start but i bought one of the xbox elite series 2 controllers plugged that in configured it to my liking got some neat little tension things on the analog sticks and on the triggers but it's also got four paddles at the back and what this allows you to do in a game like warzone when you play on controller is never have to take your thumbs off the analog stick so that means that you are always in a position where you can move and fire at someone and the button mapping on the paddles is pretty simple the left one crouches the right one jumps and that means that i don't have to press the a and b buttons at all so if i'm in a gunfight with someone this is call of duty i can now jump up and down and shoot at the same time while still being able to track the target and it started off pretty bad but today i felt like i got to a point where i was like alright i'm starting to feel a bit more comfortable now it feels a bit more natural and i played some games with stodd and tactical brit now tactical brit always uses control he's a very good controller player console kid starts in pretty much the same position as me haven't used a controller for ages but we were all using controllers and we queued up for mini royale on the dance and we won eight games in a row don't take this as a brag or anything because it's not that at all i just thought that it was quite interesting because this is a completely different experience to how it is when we use a mouse it was quite enjoyable really pretty casual i didn't really try hard that much and we managed to get that many wins in a row it was good fun it felt like warzone when it first launched but again quite a stark contrast to when we play on pc i don't know if any of you guys remember this if you were watching my war zone videos well over a year ago now i think it was about april or may last year there was a website that you could go on and it actually showed you how many players in the lobby were on pc how many were on controller or console and i did a big breakdown back then where i queued up for a load of games and pretty much confirmed that when you have a mouse you're playing against maybe 50 or 60 pc players the majority of the lobby will be a mouse but if all of you are controller it's something like 90 controller players but the second you introduce a mouse you're gonna be up against lots of pc players it's important to say as well that all three of us in these lobbies were playing on pc with a controller and even though we're in majority console lobbies who are using the controller so we'll be playing against ps4s xbox ones maybe even a couple of ps5s and series x's but it's still input based which means we've got a huge advantage here right we've got maximum field of view at 120 we've got 200 frames per second so the game looks smoother there's less input lag it's more responsive 240 hertz monitors the majority of pc players will be using a headset with good surround sound the majority of console players will be playing on a tv so they won't have that pinpoint audio accuracy and we can change the graphics settings to get better visibility and that's a clear advantage is it fair i don't think so this is something that i've talked about in a big video that i did in the past about how pc players with a controller have huge advantages over console players yet the matchmaking is still heavily weighted towards whatever input you're using i think it's a really interesting discussion though and because of things like cross play this must be an absolute headache for raven infinity ward in terms of balancing at times and as i've been practicing and i've started to get better with the controller i think that that advantage is bigger than i initially thought and keep in mind that i'm not even a good controller player but it was fun playing in these games as i was starting to learn the controller a bit more getting used to it what i can and can't do versus what i could do on a mouse because i'm finding situations where i'm like okay i've got the game sense i know what i would do here and if i was on mouse i would just execute on that straight away but because i'm playing on controller and i'm still learning it i feel like my skills on it let me down sometimes i should be doing this but because i'm not quite there yet i don't think i can i don't have the confidence to effectively pull off that play if you get what i mean but that will improve over time but one thing i've realized with the aim assist is that it's all about movement and let me demonstrate because as soon as i realize this my performance on controller massively increased okay so i've jumped in game here with stodd and there's no typical snap aim assist in this game like there was in other call of duty games you see i'm aiming and the crosshair isn't snapping to him but this game does have what's called magnetism or some people call it that and basically if you're near a character like you see how i'm moving here i don't have my thumb on the right analog stick at the moment and my camera and my gun is actually turning to face towards start because the game is detecting that there's a player there so again i don't have my thumb on the right stick here i'm literally just straight from left or right now start if you start straight from left and right as well nothing right but the second that i start moving as well you see that magnetism it kicks in again don't have my thumb on the right stick here this is literally the game turning my camera for me i'm going to stop moving nothing i start moving and it starts sticking again so how does this look with sniper rifles then we'll stop if you start strafing left and right you can see that that magnetism that i had before isn't there but again the second that i start strafing my camera starts to turn and follow so it's all about movement if you're moving and they're moving the effect of the aim assist is much more profound so here we see again i'm just demonstrating the rotation as i'm in hip fire mode but even if you aim down the sight when i move across stod you can see that there is a bit of magnetism and it actually slows the speed of my character down again i don't have my thumb on the right analog stick here this is just the game magnetizing towards that character and i'm not talking about the sensitivity slowing down here this is actively rotating my camera now here's an example where star's going to run around the corner and i'm not going to move and you'll see that my crosshair doesn't move at all so go ahead stud notice how there's no camera rotation there so if you go backstop this time i'm going to start strafing a little bit and you'll see how my crosshair moves and follows him a bit okay go stud see that little movement there okay go again that little camera rotation just pulling to the left so it's all about are you moving are they moving and that's when it makes the biggest difference this is a good demonstration of it here i'm just ads not moving i'm not getting that magnetism but then i start to move as stud moves as well and you'll see it stiff i mean here it's even following the vertical movement as well as the horizontal it's bumping my crosshair up and down not doing anything with the right stick it's just doing it itself i'm sure this might be a familiar scene if you've seen kill cams that look like this where it seems like you're just being glued on to this is what's happening you're moving they're moving that's when it's the strongest even at extreme distances you can see this on the snipers so i'm not moving we're not getting any pull there at all the camera isn't rotating but then the second that i start strafing left and right notice how the camera starts to rotate to the left and right as well i don't have my thumb on the right stick it's just doing that itself you don't notice it as much with the snipers but the effect is there and you can feel that magnetism when you play and remember if you're aiming down the site whether that's with a red dot or a sniper rifle you've got to be moving as well for it to kick in so yeah just a little tip if you haven't realized that try it when you ads and shoot someone just strafe a little bit and the aim assist will be stronger it's that simple as i mentioned it's definitely improved my gun fights and i'm winning a lot more now that i'm doing that maybe you just do it subconsciously already fantastic and as far as i know there isn't a ads movement penalty in this game so it shouldn't be affecting your accuracy or your recoil so there it is yeah just really interesting experience for me to be honest going from a full pc lobby to playing in full console controller lobbies it was night and day it's like a completely different game and i'm definitely going to be playing more on controller in the future as i practice get better maybe one day i'll just switch to it full time we'll have to wait and see without said that's all for today folks thank you for watching do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below as always thank you to everyone
