everyone and dice added 64 player conquest into all versions of the game they also added 64-player breakthrough now as far as i know that was only available before on previous gen so a lot of people who are playing this have never experienced it i haven't played this at all today yet so i think this is going to be an interesting test for me to see is it actually better is 64 players better than 128 because i've seen some people suggest that maybe it is maybe the performance is better the game flows a bit better so we're going to be jumping in testing it out today and seeing how we fare dice also said that they've extended rush as well so if you're into that you can still play rush for a bit but welcome thank you for coming along to the stream this evening if you're watching this as a vod welcome as well great way to help support me hit the thumbs up button thank you leave a comment below also a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this stream and video today so we're going to be playing bf2042 with nvidia reflex enabled and this will reduce our system latency more responsiveness and also we'll be checking out something called covax which is an aim trainer nvidia and kovacs teamed up and they built specific game modes within that game which simulate latency and that will give you an impression of how good or bad you are with certain latency levels and there's a big competition going on at the moment where if you play it you can download it for free submit a score using hashtag brainswin games and they're giving away gpus monitors and also mouse and we'll take a look at all those details after we've played around of bf2042 and we'll jump in you guys can have a go see if you can beat my score i'm looking forward to it i think it's going to be good so with that said we're going to jump into a game of conquest now conquest 64. if you guys want to try this by the way click here and we've got conquest 64 and breakthrough 64. so i'm going to try conquest and we'll see how it is don't know what map we're going to get hopefully it's the start of a round as well and we will see what's up carl cooley how you doing i'm good to see you hey dragon fists reds should i diogo sam what's up team moon welcome where do you download kovac it's on steam it's free until the 21st of december i think and it's also 50 off during that period kaleidoscope okay i've got no idea what the layout's going to be i assume that some of the big skyscrapers will be off limits in 64 players brand new round as well do you guys know have they have they changed the amount of vehicles in 64 players or is it the same because i assume with a smaller map and smaller player count they should scale the vehicles down but i don't know what's up zach riley spicy cynthia hello charlie excited to see the difference here yeah me too i'm assuming that i'm gonna get a lot more frames per second i hope so did they change anything else i don't think they changed anything else jdp today i think it's just 64 players lowered vehicle count okay cool interesting what's up cupcake good to see you hello chris jeffrey owen all right let's do this should we do ac quite a good level for sundance this isn't it most levels in the game are to be honest so oh yeah there's a lot less vehicles look at that okay what's up zack running on a 30-90 flame boy i'm on my new pc as well setup video coming soon what's up tyler oh i've got the wrong mouse sense that's a good start oh you want me in okay i'll get him i'll get in your little tutor why not hello nice to see you can you hear that weird music eric thank you for the 50 man happy holidays casey thanks for becoming a member oh this guy's got some sick beats in the tub oh okay so that entire bit is gone wow what wow okay damn they've cut off a lot of them up there haven't they so we've got one roof point here what's up danny how you doing man couple more guys down here i think kill hey stod what's up hey gabby playing boy tyler ps3 graphics everything is on low it's all it's all low with the config i want to get as many frames as possible oh this guy's got a hover graph underneath you know i didn't even realize that this bit had an underneath section a bit of classical music yeah i previously had all the radios off so this is a new experience for me yeah all the uh all the ps4 and xbox one guys are like hey i've seen this before i've never played this version of the map before are you gonna take me somewhere attack let's go put me on an objective dead oh there's the uh the big lad the fat hawk can't we take that out i think we can oh no well that was good that's a bird man hello dad hello guys you can finally hear the music oh a1 looks good look at this what's going on the osprey rain down some death no splash damage though is there i swear i swear to god i was holding guests there to pull up and it just went hey you're not holding there sorry you just want to splat into the ground like a pancake pat thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly i'm having great looking vehicles today honey guys hey poke what's up what's the new update 64 player conquest it's available what's a bird man get down there's a lot of infantry there what's on the staffer how you doing man oh didn't flick properly enough i need to do more training on kovacs is the fps better hold on um there you go upright 64 player breakthrough is awesome we'll try adam we'll give it a shot oh that big helicopter's nearly dead you go see the deuce shooting at me then i love the fact that you can one-time people with this so sick behind me did i watch the f1 i didn't spoffo but i followed everything it was crazy it was a lot of drama there was a lot of drama going on some very uh controversial decisions i've heard but i don't know enough about the rules to actually understand whether it was right or wrong so i don't want to comment on it because i'm i'm ignorant to it no i don't know everything about it i don't think i could give a valid opinion of it i mean so it's a lot more chill with 64 players i can say that oh there's a turret right there actually this objective that's a nice looking bolts getting that how are you jack i'm good call thank you i'm very good going to enjoy some battlefield for the next couple hours see how it goes what the hell i'm seeing a lot more of these get him grenade where'd you come from angel i even need your real name oh that's close stop focusing there super hawking coming in i kind of wish that the m5 travels faster you know i feel like the travel speed is quite slow there's someone hiding here i'll get you time don't worry yeah a bit of a late one today i mean why do you think there's an enemy there this guy's got hang on there are different color top talks you guys know that [Music] i had no idea oh stop uh sam thank you for becoming a member hey rob what's up are we playing 64 player conquest i've just added it into the game on pc and next gen which is which is new [Music] i see you boris oh nice little corner peak there hey mikael i am the tuk-tuk man you are the tuk-tuk man what's it like being the tuk-tuk guy i saw a screenshot on reddit someone had like got mastery on it or something that's a lot of kills with the tutor then figured out how to do 180s and stuff it was sick we're doing it [Music] okay someone here still oh look at that man look at that so quick love this gun i don't think it's as good as the ak as i just get killed by an ak it's pretty spicy the fact that you can just one tap someone like that unsung death have i tried the lmg's post update yeah i have pkp is nuts special i mean this really condenses the game doesn't it i feel like i can control the firefights a bit more all right okay they need to fix those grenades they're so annoying i didn't have that reloaded or though three people down here i kind of want to put some grenades in there and see what happens you know reloading conquest of ages and portals pretty good i've not played it isn't it just conquest on all the classic maps right beautiful can we go up and try and take this roof point here lance what do you reckon 210 degrees 200 meters hello lagoon what's up where is the destruction this i don't think there's any destruction on this map there's a like a tower that can fall over that's it up we go squad i said everyone just tea bags in the elevator because that's what you do apparently i love the the music man this has added a whole element to the game i didn't know that i needed oh no maria i think maria gone can i get the rest yes love that oh i just faced through the wall i'm underneath the map oh no we're stuck inside the building can i get out i'm stuck i was in the elevator and then they res me and now i'm stuck in the building and we're back we're back don't worry it's fine nice little bug there who's shooting at you right let's try this again coming out of an elevator with dozer is the way korea it's close to me leave horror away i'm sorry dozer would be a really good player you know that turret right there with the shield man hack frags i love that daniel that's good tank where did tank go legend yes this guy's a great player time good medicine the big chunky boy you just can't stop shouting come here oh no donkey boy i just want to take you down oh close they're trying to cap it look someone in the air over there what the hell why is she yelling so much i don't know go go go go oh that was so close that was so close getting me down hey hamza what's up danny big chungus of disguise yes indeed why can i not can i actually you know well there's just enough there to do it i think there's people here oh they're below okay what if i go down the elevator i can't stand what's with the antifreeze guys can someone explain to me why did they put antifreeze in all the levels why is that why is that a thing oh my god you've just come you've come down to rest me absolute legend great player right there all right here we go big kill big kill i missed i was going for the special one you know you've always got to go there dmca from nintendo inbound did you guys recognize that song i was doing that oh the trade kill i love it co2 fire suppression it also would suffocate you what's happened here is that the thing that falls down might be can i get this helicopter we need someone with a soft lamp sounds like a vaccine yeah it does what have you got tank a baltimore i'm so happy that that's been nerfed now it's really nice to be able to play the game and just not get dunked on 24 7 by bolts i'm across the map super mario 64 castle you guys know it thank you let's go this guy's a ledge absolute ledge i mean they've nerfed the damage a lot haven't they and the cooldown it's a lot better now you want to come down there you put the music on we can easily get shot out of this but no one's shooting at me for some reason uh-oh there's a tank behind us i can't aim down the sight that bug is really bad sometimes if you leave a vehicle you can't aim down the sight that needs to be fixed asap big big game breaking bug luke thank you for becoming a member i have a new set of plants yeah i do i do have a new setup it's quite spicy let me tell you quite spicy indeed that's a big fight going on here [Music] ah good kill hello alex what's up love you guys yeah um guys i just want to say as well um i've had so many people tweet me and just leave comments saying how much they really enjoy the gun master game mode that i put together um so i just want to say thank you you know it's um it's super cool it was a great opportunity to actually i was something that i designed in the game obviously i didn't i didn't invent gun master or gun game but it's a gamer that i've always loved but i came up with the the map rotation and the weapon rotation the concept of it and then ripple effect uh put it together so it's super cool man i think it's going to be there for another week so if you want to play that go get your gun master on awesome to be involved with that damn three people there what's up ming even people who you know don't usually play gun master have said oh you know i haven't won a game yet but i've been having fun with the mode and trying to get a win that's awesome quite an even game this where am i ahead of me i keep people [Music] still people around here tank oh nice sundance skin there see that was yellow you like coverage jd's game mode too vip yeah it was interesting what's up jason woodley how you doing i'm just tired of fps fps games in general [Music] i'm dead so many people how many kills we got 43 not bad not a bad game to start with not perfect but better 64 player is good thanks for your feedback dustin hold on get around here there's a guy in the statue there get back into if i can rest this guy as well always try and go those rez's get the teammates back up i'm gone did i just kill someone that jumped out of it then i think i did i think i hit someone that jumped out with a rocket direct hit hey matthew you're tired of having frames per second i think they men tired of fps games maybe i mean if you think about it there's not is there much more innovation that can happen in fps games probably it's probably short side of me to say that but what else can you do bit too far away there the old ac gotta close the gap try and get the results it's a very different vibe isn't it 64 players damn it i didn't rest a lot though this game which is great [Music] how close this game is look at the tickets maria maria please thank you [Music] does this pistol even go that far no i don't think so are we going to lose unfortunately good game though gg really interested to play some of the other maps a bit later on a good day's work but i'm not one to brag please no angel please no angel please no angel thank god for that guys we didn't get an angel i'm so happy about that oh we got number one squad though hey matthew do you like the band death grips i've not heard any of their stuff matthew sorry the trek do you prefer 64 or 128 i mean that was my first match on 64 players right there jason woodley thank you for becoming a member luke thank you for the 17 months and lightning wolf thank you for becoming a member what's up pros hs yeah so if you want to play 64 players on conquest or breakthrough click here then you pick here 128 is still available but they've put those in i think i don't think dice are like at work anymore i think they've broken up for the holidays now so this will probably be here for like another month or something and they've extended rush as well i think is it important where's rush breakthrough breakthrough yeah it's important right so we're going to do a little sponsored segway here guys we're going to switch to kovacs which is an aim trainer a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one today so i just need to change my mouse dpi because it was running at the wrong speed there so here we go kovacs is a name trainer that you can get on steam and they've teamed up with nvidia to make a couple of custom game modes in it and you can download kovacs for free at the moment if you want to try it out and there is a giveaway happening where if you submit a score on the thing that we're about to play and you use frames win games on instagram or twitter you've got a chance to win prizes you don't have to beat the best you can just play it and when i say prizes this stuff is pretty insane so they're giving away nine rtx 3080 ti graphics cards logitech pro super light mouse which is the mouse that i use and nine 360 hertz monitors so we're going to jump into this now like i said this is free until the 21st on steam and this is a really cool way to train your aim try and get better if you want to get used to a mouse a lot of pro gamers use this to practice and warm up and then video have done this because they want to give people a way to understand system latency so nvidia have a technology called nvidia reflex which i use in a lot of games i use it in battlefield 2042 which you just saw me playing i use it in apex i use it in valorem and it essentially reduces your system latency so if you load up the game click here nvidia experiments and there are two available latency frenzy and latency flicking and what's awesome about this is that they figured out a way to artificial artificially add latency and you'll see what i mean now so let's take a look at the frenzy one and there are three stages of latency 25 milliseconds 55 milliseconds and 85 milliseconds 25 milliseconds that's the most responsive version of the test 55 maybe that's more like a 120 hertz monitor 85 feels awful it feels like there's a lot of input like so in theory the lower the millisecond the highest score i'll get and it randomizes the order as well so we're starting off with 25 milliseconds so i'm just gonna do this really slowly to show you guys so you get the basic gist of it this is the warm-up phase for 25 milliseconds you aim you click the target get used to that latency and then you will play that and make a score so it's 45 seconds and you've got to try and get as many as you possibly can within that 45 seconds so with this being 25 ms this in theory should be my best score and it takes a little while to warm up you know you kind of get into a flow with it and i think your accuracy is actually important here too as far as i know if you miss if you miss one it will actually reduce a score don't quote me on that but i was testing it earlier and i think that's how it works so 25 ms feels really responsive this is almost like you feel connected to the game it feels smoother and it feels a little bit easier to aim i don't have v-sync on i'm playing on a 240 hertz monitor it's nice two and then it will cycle to the next latency so this is 55 ms 55 ms isn't bad you start to feel it a bit you start to feel a bit of that input lag session complete you kind of get focused in it and you you go a bit crazy so here's my score but this is where i'm scoring points just trying to click as many as i can within that 45 seconds there's a leaderboard as well which i'll show you guys afterwards but this is why system latency is important it just enables you to aim better you see i'm actually overshooting some of these because i'm trying to account for that added input lag but this is a brilliant way to train you want to get better at fps games on pc let's say you bought a new mouse you got a new system a new monitor session here we go how do we get 109 2 1. and this is 85 milliseconds so this feels horrible like to me this is like playing v-sync sometimes playing at 4k can feel like this session complete that's the warm-up done three two one let's go really trying to focus here get as many as i can what would be brilliant as well is if in the future you could actually choose the latency so let's say i wanted to add 150 ms what does that feel like focus yeah it just randomly puts the ball on the screen you can change the sensitivity as well of course change your fov block frame rate and all that stuff so that's all three tests done um so that's my last session there so i actually scored more on phase two there it's probably because i was warmed up a bit um but as you can see phase three is actually my lowest score but there's a scoreboard here where they've put some um content creators who are playing this and you can see like best scores stod's got a score on there lulu nothing that guy was an ex counter strike pro but as i said link is down in the description below if you want to check this out for yourself it's free at the moment and if you submit a screenshot of your score on twitter or instagram using frameswin games then you've got a chance to win some of those prizes that i just talked about so that's the first test the second test is flicking this one's quite difficult so this is all about flick shots like whether you're sniping in counter-strike or sniping in battlefield whatever it might be valeran let me show you and with the added latency as well this can get really really tricky so essentially you go to center you click on the blue and then you have i think it's less than a second to click the red one and you only get one opportunity so it's all about drag shots click shots that kind of thing and again you got to warm up you got to try and get into a flow with this so we start with 85 this time so this is the worst one oh man it just 85 ms is horrible but again you guys can try this you can see how it feels right here we go let's see what we get one the ones that are closer a lot easier to get so obviously you don't have to move your mouse as much oh never going to get that one see the close ones aren't so bad it says once they're a bit further away i use a really low sense as well i have to like whip my mouse oh session complete i think i've got like eight or nine there yeah there we go one so warm up for number 255 ms here we go scoring yes yes imagine trying to do this with a controller oh i was gonna get two long ones in a row there and then this is 25 ms so this feels nice and responsive so we should in theory get a higher score on this one session here we go last one two one turn on the hacks oh this is so much easier with low latency should be more consistent i got three in a row then session complete there we go so that's the flick test done so as you can see look at the top here where my mouse is 85 milliseconds i scored eight pathetic 55 milliseconds 10. not much difference between the two but when we bring the latency down to 25 ms 19 so i've almost doubled my score there and it's only what 30 ms extra with 55 ms so that makes a huge difference huge difference but yeah like the more you play it the better you get so we'll do the first one again see if we can improve on it get into that rhythm you know one can you explain latency it's essentially the time for when you click to something happening in the game and on your screen so let's say you're driving a boat and you move the wheel and there's a lag between the boat actually starting to change direction i think that's the way that i would describe it the lower that is the more responsive it feels and the better you can aim [ __ ] you can acquire a target smoother the game feels so now i'm warmed up a bit this is much better some pros as well absolutely smash this like it's insane i mean i'm 35 years old and there are some pros that i've watched who are like pro-valorment or counter-strike players and they're like getting literally a hundred more than i do in the leaderboard which is nuts like that's just insane eddie it's free at the moment it's free until the 21st if you want to try out and enter the competition session complete okay i'm warmed up for this one he's feeling good here we go damn it missed a few there i'm sure you could just do this for hours and hours and just try and get really good at it your hand starts to hurt after a while oh mind does anyway i feel like that was a good one 111 2 1. oh no not 85 horrible okay this is the last one here we go right i'm ready see what we get session complete parliament let's go two one boom oh god feels like i'm running my mouse through treacle or something i wonder if there's a tactic where you could just like follow the ones that only move and just leave one of them you think there's a strategy to this guys or do you think it's just always random and based on your skill did you actually gain this i don't know i bet someone could make an aimbot for this session here we go what do we get one two two one eleven ninety three so that's what you would expect so the lower the latency the higher the score and my best is three six five in total i recorded that earlier today so if you guys have a go at this like i said link is in the description it's on steam if you want to check it out for yourself see if you can beat me it's timmy's a pro apex player i think see they scored four six four mad that's 99 higher than me insane insane how good people can get at this yeah there are some other modes available as well on this game but there it is that's kovacs and video experiments is right there as i mentioned submit your score and you've got a chance to win gpus mouse and 360hz monitors big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this as well and we'll be playing bf2042 with reflex enabled which will help lower our system latency scott what's up man what's my monitor hp omen x27 very good monitor oh we crashed not like this tinder tatman's playing what he's playing kovacs i think i'm gonna have to task manager this one that's 240 hertz monitor not 360. i don't think um i don't think you can get any 1440p 360hz monitors yet please correct me if i'm wrong as far as i'm aware [Music] oddball that's an interesting question [Music] what's up nick from south africa glad you caught the stream thank you man [Music] just relaunching my game sorry guys when are my bf 2042 settings coming out um i mean i just use free this config you just put everything on low use the config that's what i'm doing [Music] best way to run the game to be honest at the moment on pc [Music] [Music] okay we're back sorry i just had to restart my pc there i'd lock my pc up for some reason when i opened battlefield not ideal [Music] what's this theme i need it it's from the bf5 soundtrack barfield 2077 [Music] yeah bf still crashes every now and again it's a shame [Music] loading the hacks that's right darren [Music] okay hopefully we don't crash this time [Music] you're doing good yeah i'm good thanks urban goose thank you [Music] the music was relaxing nearly fell asleep am i floating in dr pepper oh that's funny oh it's crashed again [Music] why is my game crashing dg dxgi error device reset i don't know what that means i don't think i've had that one before [Music] hearing the words hopefully we don't grasp this time it's a scary way to start yeah i just loaded the game up and it's crashed again bear with me a second guys sorry about this what's up from florida blue collar how you doing man doc thank you for becoming a member appreciate that is it just me i did not have any crashes yet i've crashed a few times none of your business quite a few times [Music] i'm going to try hard resetting my pc me one second stream will keep going though [Music] there we go right now what's up from tenerife hello obicon it reflects is now too much have any of you guys downloaded kovacs and tried by the way you give it a go what did i have for tea dinner i haven't had anything for tea or dinner vlogging sprite now yeah indeed hello from lincolnshire what's up chris i'm sure a lot of you guys could easily beat my score though to be fair fastest reboot ever bullet regis fixed and our breakthrough matches go fast really [Music] i'm on windows 11 now so it's got new sounds yeah i think you guys will get hypnotized if you watch this for too long [Music] i'm playing now in the background starting to get the hang of it score two 180. that seems like a really good score i mean that's good okay so we're back [Music] don't fail me battlefield come on we can do it matt thank you for the 14 months [Music] what's up schoon we need a cortana did they can you still get cortana on windows 11. [Music] all right we're loading the battlefield i think we're good we're back in the game sorry about that guys usually it doesn't hard crash but it did this time so should we try another round of conquest or should we do breakthrough 64. what do you reckon guys [Music] i'll wait and see what you guys say come on let's get up conquest nameless hello i'm seeing more people say breakthrough so we're gonna do that let's give it a shot manifest okay yeah way more people said breakthrough okay you guys want to see breakthrough let's do it 64 player breakthrough here we go i'm defending okay we try some sniping better as i mentioned as well guys if you want to turn nvidia reflex on it's in your display settings at the bottom here i want to reduce that system latency that's how you do it too high are we gonna get dunked on by that i'll spray up there no one saw i thought someone was softlanding it guys did that rocket just go through that attack helicopter what did i miss okay that one here i mean there are a lot of vehicles here maybe too many on this map break through his phone the non-clutter response is so much better this round's just about to end isn't it korea maria's always up to no good i don't know the layouts either i need to learn them defoe here what's up nolan how you doing maybe i missed [Music] urban goose snipe with the pp90 what you mean the sng angel does it again hey randby just did an in-game test on an ac-42 with a comp the third bullet will have a higher jump than mb but with the mb the third bullet will quite drastically straight to the left you're talking about the attachments there [Music] circle how's the fps on 64 players it feels a lot better doko feels like i'm getting more fps yeah sorry the game was a bit too loud though i think restarting my pc just put everything back to the way it was before when it shouldn't i agree there should be way more destruction i yeah i agree with you too gibbs i feel like destruction is a staple of battlefield and the fact that this game doesn't really have that much is a bit sad like the the thing with it for me is my expectation right like as a battlefield player i i look at certain obstacles and walls and i'm like okay if i fire a rocket into that wall or if i use a tank to fire a shell into it it's going to explode and there's a lot of occasions on this game where you do that and that doesn't happen and that's because of my expectations previous games breakaway okay now this could be a really good sniper map so i'd like it if they you know maybe went back through and looked at some of the maps added some destruction change certain areas hello tom mcginnis what's up hey stefan what's up gabby you agree cool i wonder if they could make a 64 player version of the maps that has more destruction hello aiden dixie bf5 had good destruction yeah yeah it did um also like i think people's expectations for this game in particular with destruction were higher because do you guys remember ea play a couple years ago when they first showed this game off it was like a video of a guy smiling there was some smoke effects and there was a building and the entire building was destroyed and they were saying it's got like next level destruction in it and it's built for next gen and that kind of stuff really isn't in the game so again you know that expectation was set by ea by dice that it would have that but it doesn't kind of disappoint in that respect ali you can't get in a game you're always waiting for the players what game mode are you playing ally it might be the gamer that you're on hey canal hey trevor have the ice crack and have vehicles fall through on breakaway jokey that'll be interesting oh they they're literally right here that's a bit of aim training right there that flick ricky rickle riggy that's a good it's a name goose that's also a good name traffic goose are you a goose that's trained in organizing traffic you waddle onto the middle of the road and you use two little glow sticks to direct the traffic if that's true that's an impressive goose right there you've got to respect the goose that can do that you know oh that guy's got dx svk never had egg and sold yesterday pablo no not today not today buddy i'm not going to get a rest here am i a bit of a terrible spot there just born actually done that do they have vehicles oh my god what the hell those can explode you guys know that that was a massive explosion you wouldn't want to be next to that when it blows jeez oh man they just got wasted by that and they died so quickly he's gonna come back for me [Music] or i can just kill him that's not a good spot right there why is my fps at the moment um there you go top right what are you shooting at oh that was a clap okay i'll tell you that one thank you oh man look at these guys i reckon i can snipe those that's not a headshot okay i saw blood then didn't get a kill now this dxr is nuts um is maria foul invincible like she doesn't have a head nice there was blood there dice come on i wasn't fat yeah dog over there ranger get it reloaded jack good night maria are you still there and the k's there range has got so much range on it 120 degrees 200 meters hit the dead body maybe maria's there maria finally goodbye maria i just took out the grandma i've got no ammo tuck on that i missed you got a 30 80 ti gumbo that's cool yeah the 38 ti isn't far off for 30 90. is this game available on playstation one whizzcorn no you can't get this on ps1 sadly i think they stopped making games for ps1 about 20 years ago good console though and angel you know better than that come on buddy angel doesn't do it again i blow that ranger explode more silos okay [Music] i'm trying to do a little flank here yeah well they know i'm here now it's clear yeah it looks like it get behind them on this line and snipers in this game are so good i think this is the easiest battlefield game to snipe in though actually maybe maybe bf1 was a bit easier because i had the sweet spot mechanic but i feel like the bullet velocity is super quick on this game leading a bit too much there okay okay so we've got b you guys gonna die do i like battlefield friends eb yeah yeah battlefield friends is awesome i love those guys yeah i've met them all before i've met them in person had dinner with them into a bar with them they're very creative you know very smart smart people they deserve all the success i can't wait for them to make 2042 battlefield friends as well spawn beacon right now going there yeah they did a little teaser saying that they were gonna make 2042 battlefield friends and i think there's so much potential here like think about all the memes and all the stuff that they could take the mick out of i tried world war three map it's on my list 230 degrees around 70 meters from my position i know it's had a big update recently a lot of uh my mates have played it as well some people say it's had big improvements so yeah we'll see i don't think i need to aim up there do i imagine this battlefield with bf3 suppression that would be horrible duet the f3 suppression was awful it was like the worst thing about bf3 in my opinion almost as bad as the spread when this game came out yeah there's a drone flying around me koran i don't know what that's about what happened to battlefield mobile they're still working on it as far as i know they had a closed beta test for it i think was it singapore and then i haven't heard anything else about it since to be honest so i assume that they're just developing it i'm sure they'll have an update soon get on that point some don't say throw grenades where are they i've been shot it could be new bug for me not being able to zoom using right click that's strange jeffrey i mean that happens to me sometimes when i get out of a vehicle but usually if i respawn it fixes it they actually got b1 back that's not good you see any targets guys what am i looking for here okay he's dead trafficking who's thanks for the two gotta go busy directing traffic have a good one quick bean thank you for becoming a member the best plus we've got to get back to b1 come on go right there [Applause] i think i'm dead we're okay there's a jet on this level boom get up there mckay get him off the roof oh man i might change the assault rifle see if we can say this quick beam becoming a member was long overdue lovely jack thank you man what's up milk is it better it's different milk um performance is better it's not as chaotic i can tell you that [Applause] you can control the gunfights a bit more oh become thank you the five what's my dream battlefield squad who are you picking to slay with i don't know i don't really have a dream battlefield squad play with anyone what killed me then just felt like i just fell over shotgun i might get a rest here i'm lucky thank you do i think 32v32 is better for infantry yes definitely massimo like when this game came out first couple weeks it was just uh an infantry killing simulator for vehicles because of how strong some of the vehicles were but you know they've they've gone back and got b2 they've tweaked some of the vehicles now and they're not as strong especially some of the certain weapons like the 30 millimeter on the attack helicopters and the bolts so yeah it's more focused on infantry now ultimately it's an fps game right first person shooter it shouldn't be first person dieter vehicle simulator vehicles should always be a part of battlefield though but you gotta have a balance it's difficult i think when this came out the vehicles were definitely too strong this is cool though playing with 64 players and less vehicles different experience why is this so blurry what the hell you might want to watch out for that tank i think the yeah some of the vehicles were definitely nerfed too hard i think the attack helicopter is kind of bad it should be a little bit better i think the others feel quite balanced at the moment maybe the night bird the anti-personnel rockets are a bit too good this this view is bugged when you go near those explosive things it just goes super blurry horrible yeah i'm gonna have to switch to assault rifle here did they change the scoreboard yet nope still the same this is going to be difficult there's a guy just chilling in the outbound zone here can't see him will it spread any better yeah lewis it's a lot better the guns feel way better now he's trying to under-barrel shotgun george i don't think i've even used that once is it really that good you mean on the scar or something else there is a scoreboard yeah but i think what that person was suggesting was the old school style scoreboard where you can see like kills and deaths and you can compare yourself to other people on the team other people on the enemy team i think it's by design though that they've changed it for this game and how we gonna do this luckily you get lots of tickets it's an enemy he won [Music] let's get over there that's enemy time no okay i was going to try and get that see i can kill this mckay on the roof oh nice shot wow hang on did that just one hit kill me from there that's insane [Music] what actually you just killed me from there i have a craft [Music] got one gonna be difficult this happened to me the other day is it really that good the only shotgun i've used is the 12m okay we got b1 back i just wish it would lock onto the thing that's closest to you like why not lock into that bolt yeah we're capturing b2 come on lads you can do it everyone's dying over there that's rude let's go we can do this 60 tickets maybe not try got a little flank here this is where i need my pkp i'm dead i was on my own there for ages what game mode is this 64 player breakthrough sub is jack on twitch are only on youtube mainly on youtube andres i used to stream on twitch but um i wanted to move to youtube because it's where my audience is right makes more sense for me to be on youtube damn we're not gonna do this shame [Music] some good players on the enemy team still playing on low quit yeah while doing an nvidia video yeah i mean it's all about latency right if you start adding high graphics and processing effects the latency adds up reflex does a bit to mitigate that but obviously if you want the best latency possible you know you should be playing on lower settings because that increases your fps and it's been proven that more fps equals lower latency that's why i play on low and this game isn't very well optimized either so i'll take any fps i can get to be honest with you don't particularly care about the graphics in a competitive game oh hey john what's up indigo yeah i sometimes stream on twitch but it's usually just completely different style to this because this will be a video after remember and a lot of people will watch the stream as a video so it has to be interesting and watchable as a vod afterwards the video we've got 10 tickets left guys we got to push now or never there's no way eight tickets the long run to this b2 point dj hey val what's up wait crying how you doing how are you really surprised spectacular yeah it's a shame we couldn't get past that sector yeah that was a second sector wasn't it again intron youtube better than twitch mo the thing that i prefer about youtube is the fact that it can be a video afterwards and the quality like i'm streaming at a really high bit rate at 1440p so it should look really good what do we get we've got some unlocks for the dxr there right we'll go back to conquest 64. so you can get a different map renewal okay you're like super people yeah it's an interesting game you know it's arguably more fun than pubg in its current state and it's adding some twists like with the class system the upgrades the looting the crafting yeah it's uh it's worth a go if you're on pc give it a shot i don't think it's on console [Music] degrees 107 i see that 170 meters i can't get an angle on it shame would you really be playing mckay on this map gonna hit the wall isn't it yeah 180 degrees 110 meters away are you even looking down there what the hell someone up here isn't it there's another guy back there dude this m5 build is nuts man ah i thought i had a teammate up there watching my butt about the new skins do i like them harper do you mean the the shotgun but i didn't like the boris santa i think that's going a bit too far for bf 2042 you want to see the build yeah you used to be able to turn those voice things off but you can't anymore for some reason i think they're inside the building on that side this side hmm i thought there was someone there this is the same match with half the people it's the same maps but they're a lot smaller than 64 players yeah way more chill hmm get some ammo from this whoever left it here there's a guy there let's go they move the flanks yeah so there's some changes why did i just throw a grenade i'm dead not dead only my grenades went there as well oh what that went through it kind of wish there was a rappel here or something go up on the roof actually go this way instead they'll just be camped in the elevator won't they no one up there [Music] at the point oh come on i nearly had cover there you think 32 player mats would be fine like bad company 2 size it worked perfectly why fix what isn't broken i don't know if i think 32 player would be not enough for me maybe 40. like i really like 40 players in um remember bf1 operations and breakthrough they used to have a 40 player game mode and they took it away like for me that was perfect because it was just such a great mix of chaos and interesting tactics you know you could actually employ some tactics in that game mode when you put too many players in and vehicles it just starts to get a bit crazy who's shooting at me i mean with this game i don't they'll completely get rid of 128 players because like that's you know that's one of the big selling points isn't it it's just a big battle some people enjoy that but maybe it is a bit too chaotic and the performance issues i reckon if they can sort the performance out with one to 28 players on those big maps it'll be a lot better for me that's one of the biggest problems with the game still the optimization although for me it's not really an issue anymore because i've got this new pc but i don't think it's acceptable that it runs so bad on uh you know good pcs like my pc before this was still very good you know lots of people on like early 70s 30 80s are only getting like 70 fps i can feel awful in the mouth sometimes and of course if you're on an older system it's even worse so hopefully they fix the performance on those big maps it jumps out but you shouldn't have to spend like four thousand dollars or whatever to get good framework you know i just hope it's a problem that they can fix don't even see that guy [Music] that's me obama i didn't even see that tank shoot then hey rob cheers for the five thanks for entertainment been studying for uni all day good for you man hopefully you're studying something interesting no portal for today we'll be doing a portal stream on thursday fh all the specs on my new pc if you do exclamation mark specs or set up you'll say alpha yeah i agree with you i think i think the class system should come back in some way it'd be interesting to see how dice handle things in the new year you know [Music] see what happens [Music] those are we can't hear you got a mask on there [Music] enjoy these moments when they come [Music] hey zachary marcel yeah i'll be doing a certain video [Music] a jacob 10850k is still a very good processor let's make some trouble discarded any gadgets that i can think of deep-fried donkey i think maybe they'll bring out something that smashes vehicles like a really powerful rocket launcher that could be a good unique gadget what else could they do i mean they've done they've already crossed off a lot of the cliches haven't they with the characters did we crash no we just thought tabbed okay we're back windows 11 is weird sometimes it just all tabs i don't know why i need to figure out why it does that it's the first time i'm using windows 11. but how's this map look then oh wow it's really linear okay that's completely different hey dwight foot wings is weird sometimes so this map it looks like with this layout there's going to be just a constant fight over the logo ship at the top that's how it feels anyway first impression specialist with a repair drone or maybe they could do like aoe effects where if you're if you're playing as a certain specialist you automatically repair vehicles or something or they get a buff they could do they don't have any specialists that give a buff do they they're all active if you know what i mean can you rest me please thank you oh my goodness small people just plowing me while they were prone eat my grenade 150 degrees around 60 meters from that position i want that time done 80 degrees 60 meters away from my position that'll do i'm dead [Music] i don't have any ammo i'm gonna hit i need some rockets right right here oh i didn't see you at all wow bulk was just blending in there jack the flying squirrel that's what they call me on the streets here another one [Music] tracking you're not gonna peek that okay damn the top should be using mines to take down vehicles sweeney i've never even equipped the mines to be honest i just find them like they're a bit boring you know i prefer to fly around and stuff you love the destruction animation for the vehicles yeah they're pretty good the way the tank kind of like explodes the lid and then particle effects look good you killed that sundance huh give your dishes someone pulled the side of the boat off i got the assist on that guy yeah that person was level 5005 is that a bug no so it's an s it's not a five when you get to level 100 you start going into s levels it's like prestige basically you know prestige in cod and then you can start to pick black and red stuff i've not even been over to a stay away sounds like the heavy mr lazy eye thank you for becoming a member it's awesome please share that where's the flag here down here gotta watch the top though because you can get killed from up there didn't capture this point why is everything in this game like cod what do you mean i think the gun players become a lot more like cod i agree with you on that especially since they changed the spread i mean it feels a lot better now though [Applause] [Music] this grenade's coming from i want to get up here because they keep they're just camping at their heart look i'd like to take this point he's underneath me love the content jack first time i've been able to watch a live stream in a while no problem lazy i thank you freak this config file yeah yes correct does this mean that cross play with ps4 works now devin that's an interesting question you know i don't think so because as far as i know they're different builds of the game but yeah you raise an interesting point there because one of the reasons that they didn't have cross play between old jen and next gen was because they're different versions of the maps but now this is 64 players and the same version of the map can you cross play i don't think so i reckon they would have made a more of a big deal out of it if you could i think it's still a distinction between next-gen and old gen there's no medics here is there do i have any squad mates i don't know i might even be next to my squad once have i god me here got the tornado huh right we actually took that which is good sniper though but down below b1 here watch out for that attack helicopter there and the night bird as well [Music] you dead they're all just coming up there so not the repel out and that guy's a good player it's a police player tell by their movement where'd you come from on the rappel don't try to help don't try to help one time i got rocket as well mate not as big as yours though still does a bit of damage though right well actually locked onto the thing i'm in it too oh you jumped out what the tank had the empty symbol on it cause i just debated the f5 is dead no there's a lot of people still playing bf5 hunter i never have a problem finding the game on bf5 on pc anyway in europe maybe in different regions it might be more tricky though i think on console it's got a lot of players too because it's on game pass isn't it i'll go in the tornado see what happens don't shoot me time why did i take damage then well now [Music] here we go take me away oh my god it just eaten me yeah high up i am alexander if i get a chance i'll stream the halo campaign i've just been really busy at the moment i haven't been able to fit it into my schedule yet so if i get a chance i will because i really want to play when i played the multiplayer i like the multiplayer i just wish there's more maps wingsuit is the best part of 2042 changed my mind don't disagree with your judge winston's really fun wingsuit is a good laugh this has its own good now no bernie i don't think it is if not they've not changed it at all it's a big big overhaul has a zone to be fun for me anyway my grenades are after it so maybe oh no they're giving up hey when's the setting videos coming i as i mentioned earlier like the settings video would be quite boring because it's pretty much just all low graphics and 3ds config it's not really um probably tweak it the way that you could do other games b1 again yeah the settings video would just be low settings and then i'd show a few mouse thought he's got a really good video on the settings if you want to watch one you go to stod's channel s-t-o-d-e-h let's copy that oh no he was living the dream on the zipline till i came along here's someone underneath wasn't okay wasn't it do not approach me oh you can shoot through that today i'll learn you guys know that oh don't go down there jack okay how did that guy not die how did i get sniped from then go up here right at the top i think what is that hole there that's weird this is the m13 with the commando foregrip no it doesn't look a bit like the m13 though doesn't it i think with that skin as well [Music] another guy there i was behind cover there dice come on let's be honest i was behind that cover a general lounge thank you for the 50 have i tried infected custom game mode in paul it's really well done been watching since bf4 keep up the great content yeah i've tried it general um it was one of the first things i did on stream when we tried portal for the first time although i assumed that it's been updated and improved a lot since then so i'll have to try it again like i said this thursday there'll be another portal stream i'll be checking out some different game modes so might revisit infected then see how it goes q zed sorry q x thank you for the five hey jack any tips on growing a youtube channel the best way to promote your gaming channel oh man um i think at the moment you know you've got to find your niche there's so many people doing it it's so saturated you've got to use the tools that youtube have given you to grow as well so that's a combination of using shorts using live streams using good titles and thumbnails you got to get good watch time good click-through rate but ultimately you know just do something that you enjoy and there'll be people that will watch it it's just difficult to get that initial discovery you know it must be really hard nowadays yeah you got to use all those tools use the community tab make polls they just parachute down what the hell where am i being shot from oh below okay throw the c4 straight up it goes about a foot you got to be consistent with your uploads as well regular content you know make sure that you're at the top of those feeds that people are subscribed to you because i mean me personally i'm subscribed to over 100 channels on youtube and you know everyone's vying for your attention so i think consistency is key whether that's consistency in quality content or you know regular content that you're uh happy with that you think he's good that's shocking again man factory barrel factory mounts number one bookshop i'm gonna try that because that is that's insane that's the second time that's happened to me so it's factory barrel is it just bookshop it was double o bookshop wasn't it i've not unlocked it [Music] hmm okay i need to unlock that at some point [Music] so that's what's deleting me [Music] overshot that by loads [Applause] oh come on both of those kills were just taken from me i didn't even get assists what though this gun is sick mp9 nice feels good i just got eaten they still at the top oh i know at the back i'm sorry what where did you come from okay did you just grapple at the side there or something that's weird stephen i'm hungry me too buddy i need to go get food shocking again the smg has no recall i'm i am controlling the recall a bit effective but it is very low recall yeah you're right [Music] dj this is 64 player slime 64 players it's a quick game battlefield with jack it's hot stuff there is actually a squid game game mode impossible my friends turn the game has made it you just searched the gun that i played with and it's
