although it's kind of a secret at the moment it won't be for much longer battlefield 2042 has levolution moments for example a radio tower on top of a building here on the kaleidoscope map has the potential to topple and take out enemy vehicles and players along the way in spectacular fashion so how do you do it then well it's connected via four cables that are cemented into the ground if you use explosives on all four of them they will snap and send the tower crashing downwards pretty cool you could always just bash into it a few times with a condor or a helicopter too that seems to work as well now there are a lot of other crazy details in this game that i thought we'd take a look at today and a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one we're playing and recording in 4k with ultra settings using nvidia reflex and dlss for lower latency and great visual quality this is as good as the game can look more on that later in the video another awesome evolution event can be found on the map discarded both sides of the container ship have a section that can be pulled down and it's supported by two winches on either side if you quickly interact with both winches one after the other they will malfunction and pull down a large section of the boat instantly destroying anything underneath it including tough vehicles like tanks this does have a more practical use too though it will expose the ship and open up new flanking routes inside so if you need to capture the flags on top try this to explore a new tactical opportunity if you're having trouble hitting vehicles far away from you with the m5 rocket launcher the scope of the weapon has accurate mil dots and reference marks to line up your shots perfectly what i like to do is quickly ping my target and find out how far away they are from me in this example here the enemy vehicle is 100 meters away so i use the top and center line to aim there where it says one for a successful hit moving further away though to 200 meters we use the second line with the two next to it to arc the rocket in that's a good hit and then a more extreme example here 400 meters away from the target aiming higher to account for the drop and lining the target up on the fourth line for 400 meters as you can see it hits first time this detail will help you to improve your accuracy and destruction hopefully of enemy vehicles while we're on this topic too it's interesting to note that bullets can travel extreme distances in this game here we can see a target 2000 meters away on the biggest map breakaway and with a well-placed shot it is possible to take out enemies with a one bullet headshot this far away from you the engine will simulate the bullet going that far when you're running around on the battlefield you may not have noticed how helicopters interact with the world usually they don't come this close to the ground unless i'm flying them and crash but the air movement created by the blades actually affects foliage and trees that are nearby it's directional too and dependent on the position of the chopper there's some nice physics happening here they'll also kick up dirt on the ground too changing the lighting and visibility in that area you can take out the smaller bushes and trees too if you ever fancy a bit of light gardening and horticulture explosions and tank shots can have an impact on light physics objects too notice how when this tank fires its main cannon the blast affects everything around it including small clumps of grass your character leaves an impact here as well when running around on natural surfaces like snow and mud you will leave footprints behind you other players nearby will do the same too so you could be followed stay alert if you wanted to make a bigger impact than that though and drive around in a heavy vehicle tanks in particular will leave huge tracks behind them again visible by other players i like to draw things in the sand sometimes always completely innocent i promise and the tracks are surprisingly detailed though if you jump out to take a look at them close up it's very impressive animals are no stranger to battlefield games from rats to birds in the sky and sharks in the ocean however there are a couple of new additions in bf 2042 on the renewal map there's a room full of red butterflies which i assume are engaging in their own battlefield of cross pollination penguins too including some adorable chicks they're just so fluffy there's a snake on the hourglass map here you can find this guy roaming around the level on the far out sand dunes it even has a custom animation and sound effects i asked on twitter what kind of snake this was and the most popular response was a black desert cobra i looked it up looks similar could be that one back on the breakaway map we can find several blue whale skeletons on the beaches i've done a bit of research on this and apparently it's a common sight in the antarctic and this is because of the harsh weather conditions here animal remains and skeletons often washed ashore by glacial changes and are well preserved because of the environment interesting detail it could also be a call back to the whale that was found swimming around on the battlefield v map narvik breakaway because of its location is covered in mounds of ice and snow if you pay attention to certain ice shelves and structures you will occasionally see bits of material melting from them and falling to the ground looking down into the eyes we can distinguish the different layers of it and the cracks inside of it giving a real sense of depth you'll also hear the strange sounds of the eyes cracking and shifting underneath the surface this is not a made-up sound effect either and it happens in real life on frozen lakes and large bodies of ice another cool sound effect is how the breathing of your character is tied to their movement speed for example if you sprint your character will breathe heavier and practice different breathing techniques as they go after stopping they will excel heavily as they recover listen up that short burst of speed there well that's more exercise than i've done in real life in the last two years up next a couple of cool details that we've noticed with these specialists you can take out enemies with mckay's grapple hook just hit them in the head with it that one looked pretty painful irish's armor shield can stop vehicles like hovercrafts dead in their tracks exposing them for some easy explosive damage tanks also ramp straight over them from the front enough so to the extent that you can stand right in front of it and not be run over by it could save your life in a pickle also we messed around a bit with dozer's shield and discovered that there is no projectile currently in the game that can penetrate it tank shells don't work rockets from helicopters nope it can withstand them all grenades will also bounce off it too and once they hit the shield they can be reflected in different directions and turned against the person that used them it also reflects bullets too meaning that you can use bullets fired at you to kill other players that are moving towards you or angle it differently to take out someone else you can also bounce bullets from shield to shield think of the possibilities pretty crazy rau is quite an interesting specialist too that's often overlooked he can hack almost anything in the game if you hack enemy players and kill them they will release a pulse that will show you any enemies hiding nearby behind cover in the near vicinity they'll be highlighted here in red more importantly though he can hack vehicles including helicopters if you manage to do this the helicopter will not be able to use weapons or release counter measures such as flares essentially giving you a free kill on them with a couple of anti-air stinger shots nice little detail for the user interface here if you want to quickly figure out what fire mode your weapon has selected you can use the information on the crosshair in the middle of your screen to figure it out it's quite simple a normal four part crosshair means that you're in full auto a three part crosshair with the top removed is single fire and a four part crosshair with broken lines or dashes is burst fire nice and easy to remember the tornado that can turn up during one of your matches is a very impressive visual effect especially at 4k ultra it's full of debris lightning strikes and it will pick players and most vehicles up and throw them if they're in its path it has different visual effects too at the bottom for whatever surface it's currently traveling on for example when on the ground it will pick up a load of dirt but when on water you will see it collecting and disturbing water in its path you can actually fly above the tornado too for some contrasting serene scenes take a jet fly directly upwards and you can burst through the dark clouds and find blue skies and sun get away from the battlefield for a bit maybe bit of peace and quiet before flying back down into the chaos whilst we're in a jet the f-35e has a great detail it has veto capabilities and that means that it has traditional runway takeoff and flight or vertical takeoff and landing go into first-person mode and look at the heads-up display in front of you switching flight modes is reflected accurately on the controls on the console going here from normal flight to vtol mode and then back again you can see how it changes that's something most people might never notice but it is there the wildcat here is a monstrous armored vehicle it's great against infantry and vehicles especially helicopters but the main cannon has got a cool little effect if you fire it you can see the shell casings being ejected out of the side here and they are little physics objects that interact with the world around you of course they will despawn over time but many of you may not have noticed that what you may have noticed though was the heat distortion there coming from the engine finally the c5 explosive has a simple display on it and every time that you press the detonate button it will show you a message you can deplete all of your explosives and keep pressing the button though to cycle through the random messages there's all sorts here and it makes me wonder if there's a super rare one that no one has found yet and that's it for now there are loads more details in this game that we haven't mentioned or are yet to be discovered and if i see any really awesome ones i'll be sure to make a new video like this one do let me know though if you found any others in the comments below if you enjoyed this video consider leaving a like to help support me and once again a big thank you to nvidia for sponsoring this one as i mentioned we were playing this at 4k ultra graphics using an rtx 3090 graphics card alongside dlss and nvidia reflex technology simply enabled in the menus i use nvidia reflex in a ton of fps games nowadays and it lowers your system latency up to 28 improving your pc's responsiveness and input time nvidia dlss uses ai to boost your in-game frame rate while keeping quality high delivering sharp and detailed images i've been using dlss at 4k performance mode when i play at the moment bf2042 performance appears to be cpu bottlenecked so depending on your pc setup you may or may not see a big performance jump at 1080p or 1440p resolutions when using dlss but at 4k it does give my fps a nice little boost try it out for yourself and see what kind of difference it makes cheers for watching guys have a great day subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music]
