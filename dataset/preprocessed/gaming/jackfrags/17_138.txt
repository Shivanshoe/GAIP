something a bit different today we're going to be taking a look at a clip that is circulating in the call of duty warzone community this clip is from a content creator named diaz before and it was streamed on his twitch channel on the 13th of january let's take a look at the clip see is the game back is the game back it's an unusual clip isn't it on first viewing it seems like at one point he's shooting an invisible player on the tarmac of the airfield in front of him and gets an armor break this has led to some members of the warzone community accusing diaz biffle of using a cheek called silent aim or magnetic bullets what is silent aim here's a clip of somebody spectating a cheetah using silent aim from seven months ago on the cod warzone reddit it allows a cheater to fire near an enemy target and hit them even if they're not looking at them now i think this whole thing is fascinating and the clip itself is begging to be looked at and picked apart so that's what we're doing today a detailed analysis just for transparency i don't know diaz bival i've never spoken with him and i don't follow his content the only thing i care about here is trying to understand what happened in the clip can it be explained and is it possible within the rules and parameters of the game without third-party software and i've actually done some in-game testing here too and discovered some very interesting things about the game that i didn't know before i've taken the clip from the source as well this is the best quality we've got it's 963p at an 8000 bit rate what's the context for this clip then what happened before it well it's a public game of war zone that biffle is streaming he's queued with friends about an hour into his live stream on twitch they find a lobby dropper airfield and he gets off to a pretty good start netting 12 kills within four minutes he's also playing on pc with a controller so we're now at the start of the clip before is in the airport terminal with a uav overhead and spots a player on the other side of the building engaging them with his smg he gets a fair few hits on the enemy before receiving some return fire he then pushes forward reloads runs outside pre-fires where he thinks the player is fires four shots and gets an armor break with one of those bullets he takes a breather plates up pushes towards where he thinks the player has run to you can hear a window smash goes through the building chasing them with the door open out the window finally killing the player he was fighting in the building as they jumped down from the silo we could tell this is the same player because they've got the same skin and no one else was here on the uav so it's more than likely to be the same person the first thing i want to think about here is intent why did biffle pre-fire that location as he came out the door if you're an experienced player you may have noticed it the first time i played the clip moments before there's another ping on the uav showing that player closer to biffle and then you can hear the footsteps of the player on the left side i'm making an assumption here based on my experience with fps games that biffle guesses roughly and also incorrectly where they are based on that directional audio and comes out pre-firing hoping to connect it's also possible that bethel thought the collection of plants there was a player or they knew that the tree was there and that was a likely position for the player to hide behind now we're gonna pause here and take a look there is no player model visible on the screen there's no one behind the tree closest to him in front of him the trees on this map are too thin and you would see a player model sticking out there's no one behind the smaller plant here next to the tree and there's no one behind the tree in the background so where is the player that gets hit we can't see them here so were they invisible you may have heard about invisible skins in the game recently but this is unlikely as invisible players in recent builds of war zone are in fact visible within 35 meters and they're not completely invisible either you can see their heads floating around like this so there's not an invisible player there was it a claymore or proximity mine that happened to go off exactly at the same time that biffle fired these shots well i watched the whole round before this happened in real time and biffle doesn't use any of those devices he doesn't plan to claymore he doesn't put a proxy mine down it's not that so there has to be a player here somewhere in this field of view and based on the evidence we have i think they're stood roughly here behind the planter and obscured completely by the vegetation here's why i think that first let's take a look frame by frame at the shots fired pay attention to the ammo count and the position of the crosshair so biffle comes out first bullet hit fire it's roughly at the top of the planter that's the bullet that i think hits the enemy and breaks their armor keep in mind that this is a hip fire shot which means there's more spread and dispersion on where that shot goes also don't worry we're going to talk about this later on second bullet hits the tree you can clearly see the puff of smoke there third bullet fully aimed down the site now hits the tarmac puffer smoke fourth bullet hits the tarmac puff of smoke one two three and four how do we know that only one bullet hits here though well we have to analyze the hit markers the first bullet is fired there's a bit of travel time and then boom blue hit marker with an armor break symbol and then if we keep going forwards frame by frame we can see that it only pulses once and it remains blue there are no other hit markers after the first one and if there was it would be quite obvious and here's why when you break armor in war zone and then hit the same target again it creates a new white hit marker if there was another hit after that armor break we would see a new white hit marker and another pulse i've done a quick demonstration here to show you how that looks i fire and get the armor break hit marker with the armor break symbol it pulses once and it's all blue i fire again after the armor break a new white hit marker appears to indicate that the enemy doesn't have any armor and it pulses again now we don't see that second white hit marker or second pulse in the biffle clip that means that only one of those bullets hits and it's the first one so if that's the case based on the position of the crosshair the player has to be somewhere in this direction they're not visible on the screen so they must be obscured behind the planter and foliage there is more evidence to suggest this is the rough position of the enemy player 2 and that's from the final pulse of the uav after the armor break the uav pulses one more time and reveals the location of a player at that moment if we look at the mini-map on the source video we can see that they're roughly at that side of the planter the footstep sounds of course also indicate that a player is outside the building too so this is my initial hypothesis biffle fights the player across the hallway damaging them heavily the enemy player then runs outside to the back of the planter to take cover before hears those footsteps incorrectly assuming that they're closer than they are pre-fires as he comes out the door but as he aims down the sights turns his camera and shoots his first hip fire bullet hits the player behind the planter through the foliage the rest of the shots two three and four hit nothing but the tree and tarmac i think that's what happened but i would be remiss if i didn't actually test this and see if i could replicate it so that's what i did i had to round 23 people for this because for some reason you need that many to start a private match of war zone thanks so much to all those people on my discord who helped you're all legends so we launched the match found the exact gun that biffle was using the m1912 smg with a nine millimeter parabellum i asked my friend johnny to go behind the planter and i strafed out from the rough location biffle was in to see if i could hit him at all with hip fire as you can see after a few attempts i did manage to hit him this way and on multiple occasions so it is possible to shoot people through that foliage with a lucky hip-fire shot remember that hip-fire has spread as demonstrated here hip-fire bullets do not always go to the center of the crosshair as you can see sometimes however they do wrapping things up we're going to talk about the elephant in the room you may have already noticed it as i pointed out earlier in bethel's clip after he fires the first shot that breaks the armor you can see a particle effect rendered in the game these two orange flashes here that turn into one in the next frame this is generated from his first bullet if we're to go by what the particle effect is doing it looks like the first bullet hits the concrete about halfway down even though the center of his cross air is higher up and if that's the case the bullet would have had to travel through the concrete at that angle and hit the enemy on the other side seems a bit far-fetched doesn't it if you know about warzone you'd probably guess that you can't shoot through something this thick with an smg even with fmj on so again i tested this johnny is standing roughly at that angle and i'm attempting to hit him through the concrete and you know what it doesn't work you can't penetrate this material with that smg so my theory is busted right well what if i told you that the particle effects of where your bullets are going in the game sometimes lie to you sounds far-fetched again just like shooting through that concrete with an smg but it's true and i have examples of this in the same scenario that biffle was in because i wanted to test this as well let's take a look so watch closely here johnny is behind the planter again where i think that player was i'm strafing out attempting to hit him with a hip fire shot i successfully connect there's the hit marker but my bullet the particle effect generated by me firing the gun is down here in the concrete and there's multiple particle effects there too my client is showing me that's where my bullet went but the server is registering my bullet going in a different direction and hitting johnny i have a few other examples of this too and i think this is what happens in the before clip his bullet on the server ends up roughly where the center of his crosshair is when he shoots traveling through the foliage and hitting the enemy but the particle effect for that bullet on his client shows it hitting the concrete this appears to be a mismatch between the client and the server and here are some more clips of me testing this and producing the same results hit marker on a player behind the foliage the bullet looks like it goes in a completely different place and again same scenario that's a hit but the particle effect is elsewhere so i think that actually could be a bug in the game that maybe raven aren't aware of but it's worth showing nonetheless in conclusion i think that everything that happened in that clip is possible within the standard parameters and rules of the game do i know that for 100 certain no i'm simply basing that on my analysis of the clip and my own in-game testing i have to point out here too that what we're seeing in the clip is not the reality of what actually happened in the game on bitfor's computer what i mean by that is that he's playing at 1440p resolution on a 240 hertz monitor and getting 180 to 200 frames per second at the time of the clip what we are seeing is a 963p resolution 60fps low quality version of that with screen tearing and a lot of frames and information missing i always like to bear that in mind when watching other people play via live streams or video but what do you think let me know down in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
