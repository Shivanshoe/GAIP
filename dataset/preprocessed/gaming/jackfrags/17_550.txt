let's hope you're all doing well and welcome to call of duty warzone tonight we are going to be playing some duo's games with mr acolyte one of the best and i think we have a great synergy some great team play and we just have a good time playing together so hopefully we can get some decent games in for you tonight we're gonna be playing for a couple of hours now my loadout tonight is of course going to be using the kilo 141 still the best assault rifle right now and the spr which is uh which is a bit of a joke right now but i think this is the best build for it you don't really need to take range into account at the moment because of how fast the bullet is so if you just focus on like mobility ads speed how you like your scope obviously that's a bit of preference but i really like that scope got it leveled up and everything we're good to go i've got my little zombie on there too and that's it man we're gonna we're gonna have some fun tonight i did actually i wanted to put my my bat on i took it off for some reason i don't know why yeah i'm feeling halloween right now where's edward he's up here isn't he edward there he is just chilling out right i think that's us good to go see if connor's ready connor you there i am here jack all right let's do this you ready yeah i'm using it today i'm going full sweat mode tonight kilo 141 spr with the mobility ads speed build oh god you know what i found with the the new spr like if you make the ads too much it's jarring how quick it is because yeah because it's like instant so you're just your screen just zooms in immediately and you don't even know what you're looking at yet the brain can't comprehend it oh this is going to be good but i'm looking forward to this we always have some good doers yeah last time we played we did uh we did really well it was like second place four times yeah then we got a win eventually then we gotta win yeah so what are you going for tonight yeah i'm just going to run the vowel in the sp round mags or the the cheeky mags that can shoot through like 58 walls no no no i did that yesterday and i i needed to shower after that it's disgusting i feel like that's more game breaking than the sniper is right now okay because the sniper you still have to point clicker you still have to aim right but that i don't know if you can spot somebody like you just ping them through everything there's nowhere to hide that took ages to find a game i'd walk to the website [Laughter] have you got a bat i do have a bat why is it not showing up oh maybe it's because i changed guys not ready asl is nice it looks nice right yeah that's cool i tried the blue one it doesn't i don't know i thought maybe with the blue reticle and the blue camo would look okay but definitely looks way better in red have you unlocked the the blue hollow dot how long did it take you uh well shipment was active so it didn't take me too long for the one but i also did it for the acogs as well right probably took me a good four hours but i think i was like quarter way through them already oh man do you think it's a significant upgrade over the vlk or something if you play the game a lot i think it's worth doing like you're just trying to i don't know improve the cleanliness of your sights i think it's worth doing but i really like the vlk with the the triangle that's why people are picking it's just like a clean picture right oh yeah it's so clean so clean have you played any today none at all okay this is my first game first game first win that's what they say right exactly that's it this sets this sets the mood for the whole day well we better win then [Music] okay here we go okay playing to win connor playing to win gas is approaching your position move to the safe zone play to win yeah but there's got to be memes in between as well right of course there's always memes i feel like that's what half our games are just meme games i've done a bit of warming up i was playing multiplayer earlier oh yeah it was actually kind of fun i was just using the spr just one banging everyone um oh man it's everyone's using it right now multiplayer trying to level it up yeah it's killer though the ads is so fast a couple of boxes there you're above me right yeah somebody perched it in their top level over here i jumped out we in big trouble yep got me i picked another team though you just run in i doubt him the guy's gonna be behind me i think that's a different squad i think yeah i think there's one over near me upstairs is that p900 you've got a key card already uh someone just parachuted here i got a full bat dude i'm low he shot me through the wall another one nice jack there it is that's a good start right there victorious here is that the last squad you reckon i think so yeah because they were fighting upstairs and these guys jumped down i'm sure they'll be back for more oh absolutely okay cool good start good start start all right try and get our loadies just straight away as quick as we can yeah that's why i love coming here my tamagotchi is making a lot of noise he's got some head he's got a pair of headphones on connor he's rocking out what's he doing that was confusing me so much steeler did when we were playing what are these words making a bunch of noises and stuff and i was like what is that do i have like a browser open or something oh that's funny oh it's gotta play more hit southwest bottom floor okay here i'm gonna drop an armor box up here oh nice got a heartbeat i do uh nothing on heartbeat yeah he's underneath 170. okay actually i think the roof maybe on the brave i didn't see him ground floor there all right yeah 100 he's got a roof do you want to go up this way i just want to drop down here apparently i left to self-revive somewhere oh i picked it up okay okay that's good good yeah they're on the roof well played look at that cover that's beautiful thank you damn i thought they were on roof maybe they jumped they jumped down i think that was the same team from earlier okay trophy all right i feel like we've got control of this now we almost got enough a little bit more yeah is there any more we can loot here here i'll drop you in my money and then i'll just go searching i'm sure i can find some yeah i just need a little bit more yeah that dude just full scent on me from the roof is that where he came from did he like jump off and then go underneath i don't know because i'm pretty sure i heard a parachute okay so maybe i don't know there's a bye round here yeah i think we'll find enough in here you can hear crates there we go that's oh no we need 100 more there we go it's closer towards you okay wait and see if they're impossible we should be able to buy over here on the move do you want to go do you want to buy it and then we could get on the roof or something yeah i'm just thinking should we actually go to this one or the one yeah this will be fine this will be safe this should be fine they are coming after us i'm going to put it around here coming down here oh i thought they were the other side sorry [Applause] yeah no i'm not gonna win this fight [Applause] i would wait though they're probably gonna expect you to come back i'm just gonna just glide for a bit i'm looking for them i thought they were on the other side as well yeah i don't know that was strange it didn't matter so good i mean i'm looking for them connor i don't see them but they may have just ran off i mean they've rushed this like immediately the thing is right if they've got the did they have their loadouts i didn't see uh i don't think so i think they just had like some legendary crates or something so they might have gone to the buy should we just sweep and get load out chance it what do you reckon uh yeah i mean one of us could go down first do you want me to try i'll go i'll go i'll be the guinea pig okay okay yeah we should get a free loadout soon anyway i don't see them yeah they're here are they actually yeah yeah sell that they just waited for us i think oh my god the vaulting no okay they were just gonna wait for it yeah yeah i might man that vaulting system what happened i tried to hop on top of the wall but it vaulted me right off the roof and you couldn't shoot yeah yeah that's a horrible bug it doesn't matter anyways they were just gonna wait for us you know i couldn't see them at all on the ground i was looking for a long time there i think they were hiding in one of those crates yeah being those guys right we'd probably have done the same you would have waited i don't know if i would have waited uh maybe i don't know i think it depends how much we have we hated them like if we'd have had like a long battle with them right and we killed them they really wanted us dead yeah they restrained us in the chat boys uh thank you for watching though guys i appreciate you all being here tonight uh todd father thank you for becoming a member joel thank you for the 20. i appreciate that was it paulie ian new master hey nate gaming a joker plays yeah yeah the new sniper's sick that's what we're gonna be using tonight use the fam ass no no no no the the famous is awful awful what's up hey sav man what's the best setup for the spr i showed it at the start of the video emmett you can actually skip back and see thank you blake all right let's get this one okay oh wow look at that plane connor that's an interesting one yeah we could go train station still or downtown or something yeah the real fight downtown now let's get it have you ever tried the famous color battle royale uh i think once and that was the death of me and i just never touched it again yeah it's kind of an awful little war zone isn't it uh i don't think it's been up there no i know they burst it like a few patches ago uh there's a lot of people besides that one time with the glitch the glitch under barrel or whatever you know what i never got to try that i never tried it i saw videos of it and i i just couldn't bring myself to do it it was patched out so quick are you uh are you having a good time there connor yeah i'm trying to bully this guy i think there's a guy who's trying to shoot me let's chop it there i hope he doesn't hit us uh where you want to go here oh yeah i'm gonna land on this roof here well i got myself a proximity mine let's go there you go we're ready for battle where is that box was it on top i think it is yeah oh it's up here yeah you want a deagle uh no but yeah okay no you don't want to deal oh okay um loot down here i guess i don't think i've ever got a kill with a deagle in warsaw i've gotten one i think and it was like a necessary kill because i didn't have anything else you had to hit the one d get the clutch yeah the guy had like no armor or something so i just had to hitch on him yeah oh there's a guy in here okay i'm backing out all right i hear someone oh he's just gone up there rappel double deeks he just he literally just went right up here so i've got an sks and a deagle which isn't ideal i would say i have a deagle and a flash this is a great star ready for war yeah let's oh look at that go there i've never seen that one before enemies soldier incoming what is that redstone he's definitely up there magnum i mean i have dead silence we could push them or we could just loot what do you think it did sounds do you think it should be in the game right now i don't know like yeah it's i don't think stopping power should be in war zone like that's a definite for me yeah but dead silence i'm not sure i think if it was a really really rare drop maybe yeah i'm okay with it i think it's a bit too frequent perhaps but oh definitely you know just depends on your preference i guess i was thinking like if they want to keep it as common as what it is they could just change it instead of dead silence they uh they change it so enemy footsteps are way louder like what is it i forget what it's called like amp or something like that in uh everybody and the other cards i can't remember uh ninja was there ninja ninja pro or something maybe i don't know they changed the names of them and each right this is a repel there mark on the grid let's go yeah there's one each side on this this building here it's a really good building 6k i found zero cash this round this building generally has a little bit this guy right there he just walked in with a double barrel i think we could try picking this guy off i don't know we could go to the roof if you want and just wait for them it is a bit batman isn't it in downtown going from roof to roof it's cool that's kind of why i like it it's a bit different oh it's definitely different is he gonna come out i don't know i mean i have a flashbang we could push him i got dead sounds if one of the doors yeah i got daddy as well don't do it well that's if he's even in there but yeah i'm down for sure yeah he's in there he's uh dead uh one pushing him try and get up nice job oh dude i died so fast then his teammate on the right was shooting out yeah he was like pre-firing you did someone just um oh they don't have their loadouts was i full armor before that engagement do you remember no i think you were two you might have been two yeah i felt like i died so fast then do we have enough we still don't have enough jack do you want a couple of players two players i hear someone i hear someone i think he was southwest well the the two parachuted over towards bank right i don't know where he's gone um maybe i was hearing things no i think you're right he's on a roof he's 100 we could run away and try to snipe him i've got an airstrike i could just put it on the roof okay a little bit yeah hmm okay very interesting starting downtown when do we get the the little should we soon right uh yeah 15 seconds or 14 whatever it is you want to split up a little bit yeah we can i've got no idea what they are though here i want to give you my money just in case double threats i can just bait worst case scenario should we go to the roof there's a rappel there isn't there yeah there's one on the opposite side and then one inside we must be out running them i'm bit confused though because we've like we've been stopping and starting if you know what i mean i could stay down here oh hi i'm gonna stay down here they're coming in front door oh shoot let me know if i should parachute off i know i'm here they got hobbies i'm dead no it must have been that was the one thing that that screwed me i thought i'm gonna gamble it maybe they won't have a heartbeat sensor i think everyone's using them now yeah we had a bad start there yeah this is a little rough are they coming for you they might yeah okay i got 10 seconds left so they might not chase if i win my goo like i'll just drop right on top here okay yeah there's a boxing now so [Applause] [Music] did you lose the yeah bounty [Music] don't know where these guys are okay [Music] am i crazy where did that even come from it must have been high oh no he's close okay oh good he was chasing me with like a either a suppressed deagle or that was like a it sounded like an odin yeah i'm not sure was that i don't think that was the same squad no it couldn't have been i'll drive uh ronnie thank you for becoming a member what's up alex hey ali hey hunter how you going no that guy wasn't a stream sniper he just had a heartbeat center so my plan was acolyte went to the top and obviously he was the bounty my plan was to wait behind the desk and then they take the repel i shoot them as they're taking the repel but the guy had a heartbeat sensor so he knew i was there whoa you take your flight lessons here connor yeah you like that yeah that was good okay you can go downtown and try to get that or we may be able to go to park and check the bunker there you go no but the one at park only requires a code do you know where the code is i have no idea but my check can tell me yeah yeah all right let's go to the park whereabouts is the bunker uh it's near the monument okay we're gonna get there before the gas maybe not uh hold on i'm trying to drive and check this at the same time i think we're okay okay i'm dropping here see if i can get a gun it's been looted damn it the bunker no the uh just the bathroom here so what's the code for the bunker at park uav 602 4513 oh i don't know if we have time jack oh no it must have been loaded i think it's done all right there's a gun here yeah it's been it's been opened there might be some stuff down here [Music] don't even risk it [Music] i do want to play this because we're kind of uh up against it here do you want to try for your loadout we could yeah should we oh we've been shot from behind oh yeah that's park should we be like just keep going yeah you want to take it on foot yeah let's go for it let's go we could stop by the police station and get some ammo also this guy's stuff's still here bloody bit of body armor here yeah he had a deagle and an ak it was a deagle huh yeah what's a maniac absolutely mad that's exactly what he was um maybe yeah get your load up first maybe that we can go get you some ammo i've got a little bit of ar a bit of sniper as well i'm so dubious of people just with a heartbeat sensor out when you don't have guns i have one as well but yeah that's kind of that's why i want them to either change ghost or cold-blooded or something you know i may have spotted someone there is yeah chasing us should we get to the roof here i think so could buy some players i think they're looking to get across oh they're yeah they're on yellow there mark move up they're i got one down two down there we go we got some stuff that second guy he looked like a pistol or something there's a satchel there if you need it as well do you need ammo are you okay i'll take a munitions likes just to hold grant him requesting he's popping that straight away do you want to get a uh sure i just did that for safety really no that's that's good um do you want to post up in lumber or something just play zone i've had a little bit of a rough start so yeah it's up to you yeah i'd like to get control of things here okay let's go grab the vehicle no i'll try we don't have to worry about c4 now though it's nowhere near as good i love that inspection for the spl so cool i hope they keep some nice i've always loved that type of stuff i would love to see them add something so that we can remove the hud in the game as well we can stop here can't get in this opened it's phone call oh yeah yeah my mother calling again told her i'm working she's just checking up on you connor that's all and now she speaks russian there you go she sounds a little manly too enemy uav overhead don't hit that bouncy this is all been loaded yeah the inspection kind of reminds me a talk of bounty target very very similar so this dude is just camping in that building okay [Applause] guy here like we could probably wait him out oh yeah that guy damn sorry duke did you spot someone on orange there or something uh no no that was my previous mark oh i was just saying we should come over here he's gonna get out there oh i broke him on the back side did he die yeah he did i'm kind of down in the river now there's just one guy i think there's two there they knew we were there though down one they're still both there you downed one yeah yeah but they're up there they're putting all sorts of stuff on the building here down again oh nice jack nice are they just outside the building yeah finish one ah damn coming in he's still at the at the shed nice well done jack they are inside the circle you probably thought i was third partying guy here [Applause] he's got a sniper [Applause] okay i wanna try to get my stuff back yeah it's just down below here um someone called in a package over there [Music] um someone's shooting me there i don't know where that's coming from i can't did he pick up my no he didn't i don't think guy here damn it i just got cracks from east you know my blue mark from before yep yeah and there's also someone to the south is therefore away from me up there again jesus quad quad quad yeah the squad is coming after us that's all you right now i'm stuck down there come down [Music] they've gone in the building there's a armor thing there connor if you need it oh i'm good i got everything off those guys guys in here one down yeah give me a [Music] there we go i couldn't find that guy he was like lost well done yeah everyone's gonna want our position yeah this is a real good spot here you know what i'm gonna go drop my ammo inside here and then pick up more um i put a munitions box in there kind of at the top let me just drop everything we have a king bounty over here he's gonna hold that yeah that balding on blue is where they were swiping me from so it's still there oh yeah he's peeking me yeah wonder if i can get a cheeky angle from here i don't think you might be able to he's looking our way there's also a guy down in the river no eyes on him lost the mark oh i don't like that there's so much cover there one down love it connor snipers are crazy yeah it's so i mean it is a joke isn't it it's good oh yeah it's a big joke people have been saying like oh don't nerf it don't nervous but it's not even that it needs to be nerfed it just needs to be the magazines need to be fixed because that's never how they were intended do you want to go see what they had you need a loadout yeah i'm okay no no i got my stuff back okay i just don't have perks that's all yeah that's what i mean sorry um you don't have amped that's not a big deal okay i'll live without it i can't stand playing without amps i can't believe me but it's okay i'll survive so i just opened a door here am i hearing things i don't know you can hear things in this game apparently yeah oh circles come to us as well yes right seven people to kill connor four of the teams we can do this we had one guy over here with the king bounty hmm there's a lot of solos then oh yeah i think i've seen this circle before and i think it goes over there on blue yeah yeah i think it goes over to blue but there might be someone in that building though i haven't seen anyone peak well crossing now would be easier than crossing later but let's see should we go down if you want yeah ready i think we're good down here yellow building's probably good on the heartbeat this is the only thing i don't like about this this building here there's so many windows it's really open isn't it [Music] target got two over there broke the first one tags let's try to shoot them through a tree now i'm worried about my rights there's people over where we just were i heard the shots okay i'm worried about your left hand comes here i'm pretty sure it does no oh not bad not bad so they're still behind those rocks aren't they yes i think they're like behind the shack at the tree area okay they're getting shot from the right like gas station area by looking at me here yeah we're gonna have to move up here they not going where's this other team yeah i don't know they're in the building that we used to own right yeah yeah top top level right now waiting for the jump there it is down the first one second downed him as well nice we're not quite in here connor right here those both are dead yeah this is and it's just two three two two they're right here i have one stun uh we kind of uh hopefully hopefully it comes to us i can't really see where he is okay oh it's going out outer wall moving [Applause] [Music] cracks nice cracks down one down one come on good game bro played love it that's what i'm talking about connor that's it right there that is it the positioning wins yeah one fight that's a good spot there i didn't realize those guys were even over there yeah we hammered them with those semtexes by the way oh yeah those guys up in the building yeah yeah down down i had a broke dealer yeah good game let's see what i have to say surely surely connor surely you think yeah you live for this now don't yeah it's my favorite part nothing okay they're already queued up jack yeah they're ready to go they want revenge that was a good that was a great win enjoy that a lot let's make it two in a row two in a row yeah i am down that was a fun game wasn't it guys thank you for tuning in alireza thank you for the five nice win and ob con thank you for becoming a member i appreciate that was it marcel patoka matthew leslie how are you doing hey george how do we do the new reload animation just inspect george inspect the weapon on the sbr what's up hunter johnson yeah we got a lot of damage that round ali lots of damage big take yeah we got great chemistry we have very good chemistry only for deployment to take this time to watermark so we um i lost my gulag you won yours and then we had to come back are we getting the ugly sweater this year the christmas sweater uh i don't think so i don't have any plans to do one but maybe we could do a warzone christmas sweater that'd be kind of cool connor yes do you do uh merchandise do you have any like sweaters or hoodies or anything not currently no is it something that you'll do in the future you think or or not oh yeah yeah for sure yeah there's a couple things i'd like to do before i bring merch back up okay now we face the enemy for real i'd buy some acolyte merchandise yeah like that boom straight away just straight away yeah it doesn't even matter what it is if it was just a t-shirt that had a smiley face on with your logo i'm in would be so good i'm thinking of changing my logo i think it's it's been long enough did you design that one yourself battle royale yes oh cool yeah this one was very early on this is like uh beginning of pub g days i think oh man yeah i was just a wee little loud hey hot cheek how you doing what's up ninja you watched since bf1 that game slapped yeah it was good oh my god everyone's going to respond now they're all sweats like us connor that's why it's crazy all right there's a lot of people here one two three four five six uh okay there is a guy on the roof with me oh i'm inside all right i'm gonna die i think what is this thing and 94 i do have stopping power so you should win a yeah one on one behind us yeah oh my goodness do some work with that shotgun what is it the ground loot um uh what's it called yes yes yes so i had a i think it might have been yesterday or day before i found stopping power right off the rip and i threw it in this thing and just one shot people it's so crazy that guy nearly had me i wasn't sure if he was on the roof or not did you check roof i could check roof there's a claymore on the staircase so if you hear that go off then it's not me oh now mo down here i'm gonna try and get this guy's plate okay we got a nice bit of cash here a few more crates here too you think that's it maybe this looks clear we nearly got enough oh no there is one more bottom floor i'll try and cover two more i think or one more now well done see they got cash ah nope nothing yeah this guy had like five dollars buy a snickers bar we don't need much more what was that okay uh that was for your ammo box or someone's ammo box let's go over here all sorts of things dropping yeah everything's just breaking nice little satchel there love that there's got to be some cash around here right everyone leaves cash on the ground we have enough don't we uh yeah we do yeah we're good you wanna uh you wanna do that one yes and no i know how you feel orange box let's go okay i got this amazing am94 okay i feel like the terminator or predator thermal gonna do it now and right here right now oh gosh yeah good job i got nothing right now i'm just scanning with the thermal i don't think anybody would have cold blood or anything by now maybe does anyone run that anymore i'm not sure it was it was a very early on everyone started using it because of thermals right you remember that thermals used to be cool and now they're just a distant memory people used to complain about them all the time but they were like they were good but they weren't that strong it was just easy and cool yeah i think that's what's easy to spot your targets yeah uh i'm gonna get a uav and then we'll do a bit of hunting okay coming because we can fly over just as i suspected sure this guy's it says he's up oh maybe that's just because he's like a little higher than us yeah oh we could catch him on the back side of the door actually he's right here i think he's in there his friends just above yeah it's a good point someone in my chat just said night mode might bring back thermals oh right yeah i can't wait for that that'll actually be a lot of fun the thing is you know on pc people are just going to put their gamma right up it won't be night mode on pc well with my monitor like i can reduce the shadows right yeah i kind of always have that on just because this game does have some dark areas yeah i know those nvidia filters make a huge difference but i refuse to use them because i think it's it's too much of an advantage i also it makes the game just look really strange yeah it doesn't look pretty no i mean to stop deal with that doesn't matter but yeah i like it to look kind of okay right yeah exactly appealing to the eye so how many people are we gonna kill with the broken gun then i just seen a package coming down in over there okay somebody's getting airstriked or something good nicole how you doing broken jack it's pretty broken but it's not as broken as the valve really hoping they don't have a ghost where were they um it was towards yell at i don't think it was the spy station okay these windows are broken yeah i hate this area yeah this area is a nightmare this is a modern warfare 2 campaign level isn't it is it i think so i think that's what it's based on it's the wolverine one where you have to go through the houses because the russians have invaded and you have a like an assault vehicle with you going down the street right i think that's what it's supposed to be i don't even remember that it's been so long for me i couldn't get that yeah let's get that yeah i played the remastered version recently the campaign oh behind him he was at the wall in yellow i clustered as well [Music] i got the kill scraps did he go in yeah well done i probably didn't need to use the cluster for that just in case overkill is good good with me uh do you need players so we got this normal box there if you got a slot i'm good i am solid uh uav maybe and then we'll head over to the should i grab that i'll hold onto the box just in case okay that must have been them yeah i can buy a uav as well i'll save mine for a little bit all right let's move what's that airstrike um hey we can grab ghost right out of the rip yeah this is the only box there there's no one on you on that uav at all that's what you like to see kind of at least in this area place we can grab that bounty up in returning to resupply enemy uav enemy uav i'll laugh at the enemy uab now yeah can't do anything else pathetic try again please dare i climb the tower no it's out i wouldn't even bother i just want that headshot now that's all i want i don't think you can one-shot headshot through glass with this thing yeah dude i think it's very much like the car 98 yeah would fmj make a difference i don't know maybe i'm not sure if it's like what they're behind us yeah did we just kill these guys maybe they had ghosts [Music] what's the name chan man the guy that i killed was called bailey i don't remember what yours was was that guy gulen honestly don't remember i spied here it's possible i'm going to the roof of this building here might have some oversight i'm sure you'll just one click them anyways yeah they're looking at me now although they are in trouble [Applause] hit him he's downed he's still present there you go supposed to work out you're going to the roof yeah going in the tower i just wanted that sniper moment connor you know that's all i wanted i hear you man it's satisfying sniping this game is so satisfying i've done it very well just enough bullet drop just enough lead the snipers are different enough you good to go yep oh i hate this cross how you just parachute across hey i'm not smart as you can click on the whole thing overhead oh we got two to the left over here you're gonna be crossing over there let's go are they underneath yep there's a nice little number one down the back one [Applause] it's a balanced weapon jack it's a balanced weapon there's nothing wrong with it oh it's perfectly fair yeah the other guy made it okay his friend is not so lucky he's gone in the mess over here do you want to buy yourself froze here yeah i can get there on time oh yeah you got plenty of time allied uav overhead there we go do we have time to grab this i say we just go right across the port wait let's not fight downtown yeah get the uh position yeah play for positioning i don't know if we can oh yeah we can eat just gotta get yourself over the wall connor it's simple just like that do you want to get into the uf yeah sure you ever try i swear i swear this like jumping over walls like that always reminds me of these things you ever try like those dinosaur leg things that you can attach to yourself dinosaur legs what yeah it's like oh in real life they're kind of like pogo sticks in a way but for each leg oh i know what you mean but i'm too much of a chicken to try something like that yeah i'd fall over and die probably i tried them once and i can't remember what they're called they are so rough on your legs like i wouldn't suggest using them all the time in terms of like how tired your muscles get no they're very heavy so they're pulling on your kneecaps all right that's horrible you know what i mean because yeah it's not great but they are a lot of fun to use and watch people do backflips and stuff on those things no no no not moon boots not boom boom stilts no not stilts either i should have gotten that gas shouldn't i uh we'll be okay yeah i've got two ticks left i could go buy another one there we go this house i i mean i'm thinking about it honestly yeah just i don't know we both we both have self so it's not like we can't there's probably someone in that building or we could try for blue blue building blue buildings really strong you've got someone one guy pop possibly you want to try pushing this brief i've got dead silence he might be yeah he's just roof yep well he's on the stairs on the stairs one guy one guy he made the wrong decision now he did unfortunately he was looking for lewd you want to get a roof i sure do that lets me actually jump up there kangaroo stilts is that what they're called i don't think so is that it kangaroo i feel like they have a specific name but maybe i'm just thinking of the brand they're the things that um the character wears in portal if you've played portal yes yes yeah you know what i'm talking about all right yeah this is just something to say is this gonna be a prison ending it might be it might be those are not fun i lose all those all the time yeah it's too random isn't it enemy uav yeah i think people just do the flag contracts and they just sit up there with snipers all right thanks for playing they will find someone else oh um that was south i don't know what the building's called stuff yeah it was over here somewhere i'll check it round one quite someone else back here [Applause] i kind of want to push these guys cracks i'll come over here [Applause] where are they they're at the buy station i think i just have this one underneath [Applause] [Applause] god that thing's got nasty recoil let's go on blue still reloading is he behind that green fence oh i can't get over this stupid thing i got oh my god i got the right guy i got the right guy now he's still behind on yellow yeah the guy that was just today i killed him where did this guy go he was on yellow but i think he crossed over to the big containers okay i stole that play box i've got five so okay for now it's probably gonna work his way out into the forest we're gonna have to move here that team's still behind us somewhere south yeah they were at the buy station they're probably just gonna hold it okay i'm gonna drop the play box in here because i only got two that's right coming to you i really need to clean my monitor that's what this game has taught me you need to clean your monitor yeah cause you see like the specks of dirt or whatever right on your screen you think it's a guy running across an open field [Laughter] no is that just me i feel like i'm not the only person i i yeah i mean i i probably do it like once every two months i would say you know i don't do it very regularly i don't think you you don't necessarily need to right it's just cracked you're gonna have to move yes it's coming moving let's get that oh crate just got cracked yeah there's still dubai healing he's got an spr dude there's no way that was a that was a hitscan shot right there right at this point they were i think you see through these cracks here can you actually shoot through them i want to try taking them out look what we've got to go that's a long run don't tell me prison okay yeah there's a quad here you want to try yeah let's get the vehicle maybe okay you ready jack yeah ready shots on someone shooting at us there really i think so yeah go go go go try ah yell over okay jump okay he's out do you think that was them those guys at the bar right there it could have been i kind of want to peek over the ceiling here oh behind us yeah yeah i'm not happy with this spot i just really hate this area there's so many like playing property all bushes again yeah i'm in a really bad spot here someone just fired a shot direct east there we go oh no i have to reload has he got a friend yeah okay i got him nice team wipe nope team white yeah he had to sell fresh this thing sounds so clean suppressed yeah it's nice but i just love the sound of it unsuppressed as well it's flexing every time you shoot yeah it's gonna be prison we're ruined yeah it always is it always is here jack all the time it's never not prison uh so someone did get out this jeep here okay there's a zip on the far side there's a zip on the back side down is that another guy shooting at me that was the same team those two guys good spot holy i would have been dead right there okay two other teams left to be cb2 we're screwed oh yeah 100 not a chance in the world i mean there is a jeep we got it down we could go down to the right of prison and take the inner tunnel we got time the sewer yeah i think so worried about the uh the towers it's 2v2 or we could just zip up to the bridge threw the jeep off the edge well that's an option for us if we need it i'm dropping yeah just chill here see where it goes oh he's underneath left side did he have a friend i don't know i just seen the glenn yeah that wasn't a team wipe what also doesn't show it if they have self-res okay but there's still three people three teams sorry so it might be someone right here or above do you think he's right on the other side yeah he could be i did stun that but i didn't get a tag so i don't know a sneaky little bunny okay oh this is gross jack yeah this is gross not a great spot the thing is dude it's going to move right after this yeah the only thing i'm concerned about is that if we have to go up that rappel we're a really easy kill for someone up there and there's probably someone in that tunnel right now yeah i wouldn't doubt it hopefully we get lucky though i mean either way we got a jeep that we can play with i kind of want to check around this corner here you want to go now yeah let's go together yeah let's double peek it it's clear i think please don't go to the prison don't go to the prison not like this yeah yes okay okay can we we can get up around here or yeah we can yeah yeah we can go around the left side here for sure yeah but in order to spot us they have to peak quite a bit yeah okay they're gonna have to come right off the prison unless they take bridge which is a very good possibility here we go correct i would imagine they've run across the bridge oh because if he's up there we're dead we can wait yeah we can wait we can't left nice well done two in a row let's go two for two well two three well played playing the zone working yeah good match let's see let's see i don't think i had anyone expecting me i don't know if you did i might have had one inspecting me nothing nothing all right run it back one day color we'll get someone well we did that one day we got quite a few yeah that was a good game guys i enjoyed that see what i mean like i don't know what it is about me and connor we just have really good i don't know good synergy i think we think i like it helps that he's a sick player as well like someone in the chat said they were the last guy in that game is that true what's up joe hello campy amanda how you doing hey idris you got your spr obsidian address okay copper wrecker was it you good uh game hodges if you want to see the loadout go to the start of the stream we'll start the video you can skip on the timeline that's the cool thing about streaming on youtube uh phi q have i looked into av1 encoding yeah a little bit but i don't think youtube supports it yet ryan thank you for the five preparation is done now you deploy to the wardrobe uh chub thank you for the five got to use your creator code for my battle pass my wife and i love you and the boys content thank you so much chub hi goofy thank you for the 100. do you want me to check oh sorry i didn't realize [Music] i need a notification or something like a little sound battle royale yeah you can you can put it on but i think you have to take off streamer mode on discord yeah i tried that but maybe i've done something wrong here it might be in this you might have turned it off in the settings as well yeah i always did i just always have discord up on my other monitor so i know it's a little bit easier that way um we could do military maybe yeah yeah [Music] uh i'm gonna go up here i think oh my goodness there's a lot of people here yeah they chasing they might be there was two there right here i don't even pissed also see that one broke one's the other one's broke gonna try and flank i've only got 12 shots i'm dead that's funny still double threat so he's probably still in the tower i'd imagine i think he's south okay you think he's east oh yeah we could take the helicopter in bail triple threat yeah oh p90 does not do damage at this range he's still up there i think he might have jumped okay we could take him oh no he's still there yeah yeah oh he's dead good shot there's still people fighting southwest in the camp do you need ammo we could go over to tower yeah the tower has an ammo box let's go hey guys if you're enjoying the stream right now hit that like button it's a great way to support me thank you what did you have dropping in i don't know it's a thermal is it's like the bewitching [Music] chopper guy is broken we're making a lot of noise here yeah we are took our chopper man thank you guys i appreciate that hmm there was multiple choppers there where's the king there's a king in he's gonna come out oh he's in the bunker we could take him if you want i guess yeah let's go let's see let's hit it all right go here down the first one i don't know how oh i couldn't get past that man i'm just going to stand here oh you're crazy you're crazy you're crazy no it's okay i broke him and downed his teammate you got any place i got nothing we're screwed if you come back in here no no we'll be fine we'll be fine if you want cross back over to the right moving i'll try to watch hmm well we were going to go and get the guy in the bunker but then yeah that was a little unlucky timing ruined shoot um let's try to make our way west like up and over the hill chop is coming back so we just don't i just say we just try not to fight anybody yeah these stealth no places it's rough it's a little rough we are modern warfare multiplayer time to kill right now it's true it's true yeah we're ruined one hit scan sniper and we're dead yeah ah we almost have enough hmm are these chicken coops is that what this is i think so yeah there's chickens in the multiplayer isn't there it's like csgo make them follow you around oh that'd be great make like a train of chickens take them straight to the colonel it's like one of my favorite things to do and i don't even know why someone just bought there so are there any this might not be lured i'm just gonna buy some plates yeah there's uh all the boxes hi toast thank you for becoming a member you wanna buy some plates uh yeah we're going to get free loadout soon anyway right so yeah i'd rather try to stay alive right now hmm did i just run past the plate yeah i did i question that all the time am i ironing it res 320. olaf i'm sorry that you feel sick buddy i hope you get better soon thank you for the three i appreciate that oh quad bike bike uphill i think these guys just rised one guy he just doesn't know where he's going for the buy ah oh okay here cranks down them his friend is probably in that same compound i'd imagine yeah my loadout's not great for distance right now yeah let's close distance teammates not even here okay not currently uh centex hello over the wall maybe downhill there's plates and stuff there yeah i'm maxed out and now i'm not all right let's go load up okay i got smoker's cough jack yeah it's the same as the white phosphorus on the multiplayer isn't it all that stuff is terrible i hate that stuff it just ruins the multiplayer experience yeah so does the spr warsaw it's true i mean it's ruining multiplayer too jesus it quick scopes so fast okay okay okay by yourself is that enough [Music] [Applause] uh i don't know if there's going to be many people left in really so i think wait till we get in and then hit it okay there's no one up that stupid towers there now they're fighting your bunker area m4 shoots five five six in this game right by default i believe so yeah yeah the nine mil rounds are really fun to use in that yeah i've never tried them oh jack it's worth it it makes it look like an xbg right if you can aim well uh you don't need to necessarily even use it like an smg because it shoots so fast and the bullets are so fast there's a couple of lights but yeah have you done a video with it mark yeah just got their loadout it's worth using in like duo's solos or duos but i wouldn't try using it in quads and trios right this guy's bunker he's gonna come out is he just i think someone just got their low down disappeared there from the uab the guy up on the right well there was a guy downhill i don't know you think he must be in the bunker it's possible there's gear there yeah [Applause] should we work left i think that's probably the safer player i'm just worried about this hill up to the right oh i thought i saw again you want to go in i was just checking it's up to you we can we're going to be able to outrun the gas i think so i hope so oh it's not just a satchel i need that oh do you don't have one uh we're gonna get zoned here i think dude i reckon someone will be waiting like yeah wait let's go yeah we're gonna have to work our way around um here did dead silence yeah i'll take one of those thank you very much i'm just waiting to get pinged in the head by a hitscan weapon yeah it's terrifying man just running around at any point you just get downed one shot dead it's like you're being killed by a cheetah isn't it that's what i was saying the other day when i was playing with stone like they've essentially given us the utilities to combat cheaters ourselves like we are the anti-cheat now because the valve with the 10 routers you can shoot through everything right so if you're good enough like you know where he is so we heard you like anti-cheat so we gave you guys a head scan weapon and one that can shoot through all the walls in the game we made you guys the hackers instead uh i kind of want to get a hill location mark move up yeah yeah helicopter there i'm shooting at that i'd rather get sniped than origin someone in my chat said luke davis yeah a lot of people were saying that i've not really seen the origin this season though i like i don't know all the mp5 i've been killed by it a few times welcome this is where you want fmj isn't it will it go through the whole heli is that okay so yeah you can shoot through the helo that building is horrible i hate that we were in there that one game uh wesley stays high again apparently there's no there's just some guy called kyle t every every time that i do a stream he just comes in and he goes westy says hi i don't know if he knows westy or he's literally just doing it for a minute but if he is westy it's worthy cameron is his name oh cameron okay yeah it's his secret youtube account it's his smurf youtube account maybe shoot can we get up here oh yeah i was gonna say it because his name is kyle maybe he's just using his real his real account uh you're going left oh there's a path there oh yeah there's a path here i think you're right i don't think everybody's even on this one i don't know if they added these little paths yeah they're really useful no one coming off that roof damn i thought for sure guys always yelling at me tell me you go to the safe zone oh get to the safe zone welcome to season six yeah he he has no idea where that even came from either he's going to come to the gap here he's going to go gab i think he's going to road left oh you're right bro [Applause] she killed the back one off ah theory dearie me he's behind the tree here welcome to season six got him oh my goodness jack somebody fix this one get it on the game get these magazines out of the game i mean it's fun but it's so broken it's yeah it's pretty magnificent i took a guy out of the sky like 350 meters out he wasn't even parachuting he was just falling can we hear from that i can't get it 500 meters 415 is the max right yeah i believe so on this [Applause] there's two vehicles in there do you want to hug left side upper or do you want to run down through because we're gonna have to make a decision here um let's start [Music] yeah two guys here let's go left go left left yeah they're just chilling in the uh factory okay there's two loadouts up here okay [Applause] interesting uh they've been got i think it already if you got a load out there you'd stay up here wouldn't you he loves that yeah that's what i'm thinking [Applause] i don't know if i can get through that glass i'm smoking it yeah yeah it's smoking could be someone up on our left though yeah i'm just scanning that right now like it's nothing jack like it's nothing oh he sounded so sad connor i'm so sorry i'm sorry don't be i mean it's not it's not your fault it's a pvp game okay it's a pvp game uh i'm nearly out of uh well i'm not nearly out of ammo i've got 511 on the snipers i got 519. i don't have too much but yeah um i'm just kind of wrapping around up here i want to make sure no one's hugging the trees they are in season someone's saying sniper left i don't know the chat saying sniper left sniper left i don't know what that means what you saw maybe or yeah maybe i missed a glint it's tough chad i got these old eyes okay i missed this how old are you connor i'm 25 ah 33 i mean yeah yeah you've got eight years on me buddy behind us in the gas i heard coughing uphill you think uphill yeah it's gotta be it's gotta be unless it was a bug i think there's someone there that was weird dude i'm sure i just heard coughing i don't see anybody i've got to watch that back on the stream there i mean you may have heard somebody yeah i don't know but they've just died i'm gonna check down here this definitely reminds me of pub g days like checking all these hills like this circuit across no the area is clear gas is closing still lots of people left oh this is gonna end up on the hill oh we got a goo lager [Applause] there you go he screamed he screamed so bad that guy i think that was like an eight-year-old top of the lungs like voice crack and everything yeah that was brilliant i've got to put that in a montage on it oh yeah just clip it clip it and ship it that's the best one i've ever had over there in the factory yeah i think this may have been the guy that we were hearing maybe he went around behind us because he went from blue to the building i'm um i've got 11 bullets left yeah i don't have too much myself we're gonna have to like run over somebody there he is there and good night oh my god is that guy seeing me yes he's looking at us attack rover downhill where is this armor what is he doing oh we got a team across down that guy i'm just worried about this guy in the valley i don't think he can come up right there i down that guy in the red mark you guys are hopping no no they're not happening do you have a fully loaded class or something no he could pick up this guy behind us downhill yeah he got out of the tack rover that was rage in its purest form i killed him i'm gonna get this guy's ammo there's another one to the right do you want to push these guys take them out i got them there man we gotta go with phil this is gonna be rough thank goodness got him you're good dude you're the best uh to our right the wise i think he's up here somewhere sorry up there going in he was jumping off the bridge he was jumping off the bridge instead of fair enough it doesn't need to be fixed whatsoever you were popping off of them there dude just saying those i was just spotting people well you were like debate right everyone was shooting right at you and i was like okay well free kill i want to see if this guy stayed i have to hear more screaming yeah all right prepare your ears hey are you like how are you good at the game ggs guys those whole thing they sounded so young they were probably like 12 14-ish i think yeah i mean that's how young i was when i was playing the card games oh yeah definitely yeah yeah i was that when did cod uh when did the original cod come out like the world war ii one oh god i don't know i remember there was medal of honor allied assault and i played that when i was about 12 or 13 on like a 56k modem oh yeah that's the stuff jack and then uh i'm pretty sure that team split up and they made call of duty is that how it became yeah i'm sure that there was a lot of medal of honor allied assault devs that went to infinity or they made infinity war or something like that the first cod was in 2003 people are saying yeah 2003. that sounds about right yeah cause i was yeah i was young i was very young i was so young i was getting my butt whipped and everything it's funny um i used to play with uh there was a guy a kid in my school who was like one of the cool kids you know let's say but yeah secretly like i was uh like really good friends with him and then secretly on the side like he loved pc games so we would play like when lavonna allied assault together and rainbow six uh like you know like the original rainbow six games um yup yup rogue spear raven shields uh shoot what was the one the one i played on xbox like the original xbox i think it was and uh i fell in love with that game and then i saw the new rainbow six coming out and i was like oh my god it's gonna be so good yeah they did that weird rainbow six vegas one do you remember in third person was it vegas yeah it might have been vegas that was my first i think that i ever played i loved that as a kid yeah the og ones didn't even have uh maybe it was vegas too yeah the og ones didn't even have weapon models it was just a crosshair on the middle of your screen and really yeah yeah you would do this whole like planning section at the start where um you had a like a 2d overview of the map of the level in single player and you could give your squad commands so you could say okay you guys branch off walk here put a flashbang in that room go in clear it and you could execute a plan so cool that is so yeah for back then that's amazing yeah you don't see games like that anymore no no i mean i think there's one called door kickers which i think is a similar concept but i've not played it i have seen gameplay of that one uh i don't know what you want to do here we could do train i mean is it going to be four in a row corner i don't know we're doing pretty good here we're playing we're playing pretty smart swat is it swat swat was one of the og yeah that was kind of like rainbow six as well yeah there's a couple games similar i have heard of swat before and we're going old school now doesn't matter anymore oh they're dead okay so there's another team over there wait the deagle doesn't use sniper ammo anymore what does it use smg smg okay that's smart i'm glad they made that change i'm just gonna fly this over [Music] okay no plates here huh so we got there and there let's go on the far side okay there's also someone here what we could do is take this scab contract and the heli yeah okay oh if there's a guy going for the hell yeah there's another three three squads around he's going for the heli he's gonna get it [Applause] well we can still grab the attack rover yeah we got two here contact yeah let's back off jack i don't really have like anything i get a deal in a shotgun moving they're going to come over here i think okay do you want to grab the the vehicle yeah yeah you get the stuff i'll grab the scav that way you can just bail i'll jump over the wall or something hopefully i can get to the sack rover nope oh that's other side other side gap in the fence i think no he was on your side oh he was just out in the open i didn't see him at all if i just looked to my right john thank you for the five you won't hit a noscope for the last kill probably not pork rainbow six las vegas was a good game yeah it was cool it was a bit of a different take on rainbow six though obviously made for console and a bit more arcadey it was still fun though had multiplayer as well how's it going oh i'm alive but that's the most important thing now i'm more alive perfect hey and you're returning after me did you get this scout uh i didn't fully complete it okay oh that's where the enemies are though oh dude are you i'm still kind of fighting okay okay now we're okay he just killed grandpa i think that's two teams dead jack i don't know for sure though all right i'm being bullied shall i drop on that scav oh there's another guy there are you kidding me oh dude they run over one here running over i'm gonna get scared yeah i'll get this i think this is clear yeah if you can i'll just drive away i've got a key card keycard if i can actually get out alive we could get to a uh we can go to the close one hold on let me just get this scuff come we move to the safe zone i don't think there's anyone else around here you say that now i think these guys are gonna chase me uh i can drop you some place also we've got enough cash let's just let's go right to the bunker thank you okay i'm on shotgun and sniper right now okay they may be on the opposite side of the orange there oh he's up i've done them nice job these guys are just chasing me is he low where is he um i don't see him but he's in the shack there he was down he must have a self-respect do you want to just leave him yeah yeah i swear that cluster strike follows you sometimes oh yeah 100 i'm convinced that it does heat seeking here jack i can just open this guy yeah i'm just um watching my back in case he peeks i don't think he will he's got to give up right [Music] hey his friend just go live back in oh they're going to come straight over they might we'll be ready there'll be a minigun down here mini gun and all exactly uh what we got i think that's the juggernaut at the end yes juggernaut okay really yeah i've never used the juggernaut in this i'm gonna pop you off we gotta go run jack quick yeah moving oh yeah are we dead i feel like we're dead we might be dead i'm dropping my shotgun can i just throw this juggernaut and you can pick it up i don't think it works like that there you go there you go see if you can get that i'm gonna die obviously but uh it's not enough time is there i have a mask you're gonna be slow though oh this doesn't help me at all jack yeah this slows me down yeah i didn't think that through that's no there's no way oh man we were just so obsessed with like getting in the bunker that we just forgot about the gas i yeah well i mean we were also being chased the entire beginning of that round you ha you haven't had good luck have you no no okay actually just pick that back up then don't i come back in with like half or something yeah you'll come back with a lot of money [Applause] [Music] we're battling you're gonna win oh my god what a fight that's a good 1v1 oh look at this jack yeah you've got enough cash as well and right on the edge what is that right on the edge of the map is there another one no you're good you're good what is that helicopter doing oh he's got a king he's got a king i don't think we have to worry too much okay anybody need this anybody bloody need this it's okay don't worry oh my god god these guns man i want to know like how how it actually happens like maybe they just threw in an extra zero by accident bullet velocity five million you know yeah it's probably something like that just like ted he was a it's 5 p.m working from home he's about to clock out yeah exactly final value for the sbr and then just accidentally puts the extra zero on the bullet travel time he had too much coffee for the day shaking hit the zero again it's like ah perfect my job's done for the day oh no is there a bunk there oh you could just quickly buy and then i'll get the loading maybe he's gotta be below here well played oh he's up above that was the teammate of the guy that he sniped yep that's who it was i still don't trust your bunker though [Music] what a joke see people have been saying they think it's a marketing move i don't know i don't think so because what do they actually gain out of making this like you can get the guns for free right you can but there are people who will see that there's a blueprint and buy it maybe i mean it's a bit of a it's a bit conspiracy theory isn't it i suppose you know i think is you see all sorts of like marketing nowadays that you think now there's no way they'll do it and then like a few months later they put out like a little video that's like here's what we did i know burger king did some weird stuff recently with twitch streamers did they yeah i didn't hear about that i don't really pay attention to too many ads though they also sponsored like one of the worst teams in the english football league and then on purpose and then they asked people on twitter to play as them and send their best clips in so where's the people you killed by the way i just thought they didn't have anything all right okay they had literally nothing yeah so they um they asked people to send in their best clips playing as this team i think it was stevenage fc so they're in like one of the worst leagues but on fifa you can pretty much put any player in any club so people were putting like all the best football players like ambape ronaldo uh messi in this football team and then eventually um they got promoted so now they have to be in the fifa football game and they put the actual sponsor on their kit so now burger king in fifa oh i see you know they do there's all sorts of stuff like that free advertising yeah people are coming up with some crazy stuff nowadays that's wild i mean i don't think they would purposefully break a gun but not in this game i don't think they would no i wouldn't say that it's impossible very suspicious it's like very sus that both of the magazines you know for both of the new guns are broken that's all i'm saying the thing is it's never happened before you know what i mean like they've not done it before from what most of the guns they added apart from maybe the growl but the growl didn't actually pick up popularity until the next season right yes most people didn't realize that if you put that barrel on it you get the sick iron sight you get the six stats no one worked that out for a while yeah that was one of the things that just i mean it was the same thing with the origin right yeah like the origin was always good people just didn't realize until the other guns were nerfed someone's got a reek on here we wait i need some ammo what do you mean just a on sniper coin there you go self-resist there we go why are they doing recons i don't know they're trying to win jack on the last zone uh okay so now i never do recons but oh we got an ammo box on it soon cool you want some plates um is there a satchel anywhere no no these guys didn't have one yeah if you got some spares thank you cheers [Applause] that was good timing yeah [Applause] did they fix this building what was wrong with it the bottom floor you had never had footsteps yeah they must have fixed it [Applause] um what would you like to do we could grab a bounty i can hear that hillary above us yeah take him out where's that sword left i think sam hilo thanks i'm trying to lead broke someone just opened the door behind us then was that me coming through there i'm not sure that's weird uh hit the bouncer i don't think so i'm really liking this as well though i just throw the like the normal rounds on it i'm not using the broken irons yeah i need to give it a chance again i've not leveled it up though i don't have a decent build for war zone oh yeah you'll have to level it up you need the 30 rounders to do anything oh there we go oh they're in the building no one on the train is there okay this is the thing we have money so we could go just buy like a couple sell prizes we have an ammo box stack up on armor and stuff and then we could just go hang out on hills we could yeah he's out though dude he's moved oh he's gulagging he must be i see him he's down in the bunker do
