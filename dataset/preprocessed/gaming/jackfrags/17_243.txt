before we get into the action today i just want to say that today's video does not have a happy ending that's all so then judge dredd is in warzone now for some reason it does kind of look like captain falcon though but there's two versions of the skin available the colorful one and the comic book one which just looks really really weird in warzone however dreads bundle does come with some cool skins and a little gun charm this one for the amp obviously it's supposed to be the law giver mark ii and also these two for the c58 and mach 10. pretty sweet looking to be honest they fire gold bullets too and the builds on them are quite good for war zone which makes a nice change the mach 10 has got the better iron sight on it as well like the gallantry blueprint so i decided to play a match with these and i didn't change any of the attachments on them because like i said they're okay builds and just to keep them looking clean and consistent now he does have a couple of unique executions too which i do get to use in this game showing off that law giver and its heat seeking bullets and user id as always if you decide to pick this up or any other bundles in the store do consider using my supporter creator code jack frags and caps if you do i'll get a bit of kickback from that purchase and then tweet me a pic like these fine legends did so playing as judge dredd in warzone solos i didn't see anyone else using this probably because it sticks out like a sore thumb but if you enjoy the video leave a like let's get it so i did drop and initially i went to a red door went through it but someone else was in it at the same time and if it does that if they're in the corridor it just puts you in the sky and parachutes you somewhere random so i ended up here and there's a guy just outside i wasn't sure if they were above just outside i didn't record the live commentary at the time so we're doing a bit of a play-by-play today i know some of you guys like this style rather than the live com stuff but pretty straightforward kill there obviously that dude knew i was there but got a little peak there with the heartbeat sensor a couple people having a fight here over by costco this guy really unlucky i mean he's obviously finding someone in that window up there i just happened to turn up because they were shooting loud weapons on the minimap and i'm always gonna come and have a go in solos like i hate camping so we move around as much as we can i always try and take the fights little fight goes down at costco and there's someone in this building i've been hunted though another dude walks up outside pretty simple kill there for the tech knight but i'm a bit worried that the person inside the house is gonna jump out the window and not give me a chance to play it but they didn't if i was in there i'd have done that and then they've run out as well hear the door open so i'm waiting for the push get the crack slide i picked up the dead silence for some reason i didn't need to pick up the dead silence like i pressed f as i was sliding maybe part of my brain was like oh i don't want to get that but even if they did get it and they hadn't activated it i could kill them and then pick it up anyways bit of a brain fart window smash nearby hey look i'm looking good here though got a daddy spider guy running on that roof as well so i was just waiting for a second to see if they'd peak again they didn't but luckily for me this little guy just went running up the hill very easy kill there hobbies clear and i'm gonna start making my way over to that loadout so i can become the judge dread that i always wanted to be and here he is looks so weird captain falcon there in the dance i never thought i'd see the day i've got myself a bounty i almost died here though because this guy had ghosts out of nowhere suddenly boom just hold the foot step there at the last second we'll go for tay down here heat seeking bullets there it looks a bit weird to be honest in war zone it looks way better in cold war but i think maybe the animation system or something's different in warzone i'm not sure it's a different engine yeah and sometimes when they port the executions they don't look right so this is the first instance of me just being an idiot i threw it in the building here because you know like sometimes you can throw it in the building and then you get it from inside so you're safe couldn't reach couldn't jump on that crate so is there another way to get onto this use the buy station and then onto that weird hutch no that doesn't let you get up there starting to panic now hey bail no doesn't get up i just wanted my ghost loader that's all i've got the guns i want i thought all right then i'll parachute from up here surely i can make it parachute didn't pop for some reason it doesn't let you do it there so lesson learned did you ever need to jump off that from that particular position you will die guess the game does not let you use your parachute that's a warning for you [Applause] i just had to leave that though not load up so we don't have ghosts get shot in the back here after i put my uav on into people around the farmland not a big fan of this area though i know they're here somewhere [Applause] thank you very much for that that was the guy shooting me in the back i just kept challenging that because i've got that nasty head glitch they had a bit of a head glitch as well but mine was just better now this guy is self-preserved and stands up so we get to see the other execution where they take your gun and try and shoot it and it explodes in their hands so that's one of the features of good stretch gun it's got a fingerprint id system on it so only the person it's assigned to can use it and that red skin tried to use my gun exploded unfortunate little fight going on down here and i know that these dudes have got to move because look where the zone's going and all that dude needed to do is just look left once just once i'll line them up here yeah this c58 build is is good it's got a bit more recall on it than i would like i mean the c58 is already pretty high recall but i think it has wrap on it but i would take that off get the finish here and you see there's another guy running across didn't have enough bullets there to finish the job so i backed off switched out my 10. that's so good man [Applause] i know they did a balance pass today on all the guns but i think the mac 10 is due for a bit of enough it's just very good still and the movement speed on it is insane i think if you put the right attachments on it you get the quickest movement speed in the game apart from melee or something little bab here in the container i wanted to made him just to be safe miss both knees and just push [Applause] we just kind of feel that i wasn't going to be challenged there really so went for the aggro pushed him got the kill on the way to the buy station here to get my second self revive because the first one as you saw i wasted it jumping off a rock [Applause] so we got another one there i was being shot at as i crossed a guy upon costco two here just waited patiently night up got the beans in i reckon that guy was one more bullet from being killed then very lucky dipped into the cubby but i want this kill so we're gonna put the pressure on a little bit here just checking my back in case anyone's flanking up on me they jump out the window into another fight with someone so there was another player there which i just didn't know about having the gas this guy was it was really difficult to track them i think the gold bullets on this blueprint actually distract me a lot when i'm firing i know that i've got this dude on the ropes get the finish they've got a gas mask on but i'm letting that one go no way and we are in the zone here someone firing a swiss or a car 98 there am i right we're full sending it guys of course we are even though this is final zone i'm feeling confident here and i know there's a little dip here on the map so i've got cover today we're just in a fight didn't want to mess around with another execution then this late in the game get the bag not much else there that i need a quick look over there just in case nothing now i headed back to a free loadout that came in i was too late yeah i could have stayed in the gas there but i spotted this guy and the gas mask nearly screwed me over there got the kill i just wanted my ghost that second loadout was the bane of my entire match i never got it i just never got it three other players left this dude just comes out of nowhere didn't hear me didn't heartbeat me even though they had one there's a lot of houses in play here so probably where people are going to be i like this little spot here too but a natural cover there i can stay low known in front of me at the shed cheeky little peak here someone in the gas miles away have you noticed ever since you can get the durable gas mask from the red room people just stay in the gas way longer as they should i mean it's a valid tactic there's nothing wrong with that but i've just noticed it so much more so we're down to the last player and i'm gonna hold my hands up i make a mistake here i make a big mistake and i'm gonna show it because no one's perfect you can't win them all and i think if you care about this kind of stuff you can learn from your mistakes and try and improve so i don't know where this player is right now i assume they're in that big building there because the corner of it is still in but i've got to move because i'm not quite in the zone a bit of a gap to cross here not much cover i've got to go for it though i'm feeling that if i can push up to that house there's a little thing in the middle there's a bit of hardcover i can hide behind so you make the move push in the heart beat the building they're on the right and i'm gonna peek get a few shots and now i just got bloodlust i just wanted this kill so bad they put an airstrike on me and i thought by the time i get to the wall here i'm out of range of the airstrike i wasn't selfres get up almost kill the guy and they turn around and hit me once i was just so so sad about that and in hindsight watching it back after that air strikes come down instead of me pushing aggressively and just assumed that i was out of range of the airstrike i should have dipped back and just held the corner of that building that i talked about because it was still in the zone and i had a durable gas mask but there it is like i said you can't win them all and i haven't got a problem showing you guys when i fail but that was a really good match though enjoyed it lots of kills lots of movement just couldn't get the win it is what it is that said guys
