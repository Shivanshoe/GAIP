so a in 94 yeah I don't know what to put on it I'll put a heavy barrel on it because that accuracy maybe that's it maybe that's all you need all you need I'm to know what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with the l85 that's classic that and I'm gonna gotta have Black Shark camo on there are the black and orange one yeah I hear it increases your kill streak by a hundred percent let's see how many times we can get killed by vehicles yeah from halfway across the map so do you go full auto with the N or do you keep it on burst this is thing I was using full auto the other day and I was missing so many shots because just the rate of fire is so slow yeah yeah I switch to burst but the recoil is pretty insane when you do the burst if you don't let it reset yeah that bursts pretty nice yeah it's not bad I know it's just one of those guns on when I actually played before regularly I just never really used the a 90 for the low volution is gonna happen soon I think yeah I can see it it's gonna blow there she goes across the river yeah I got one guy dude it oh the so many vehicles come yeah I know they're everywhere this is BTR hanging around over there he's a bit of a delete oh this is good it's a time time time there's a tank right behind us it's gonna try and round me you know I'm learning the damn screw it go for a swim yeah there's another Jeep going fast right I made it have you seen the movie the future tape with Harrison Ford no Tommy Lee Jones oh it's a classic this basically happens in the movie like this oh damn some of it down yeah I saw that yeah so Tommy Lee Jones like porn is him inside a almost like a a dam or a sewer system right and then he he like jumps off it's his only option come it's for only option I can I could put a medkit down it it doesn't flow away look at those physics I'm installing that sorry it's breaking my immersion it's not realistic enough there's some nice water physics on this game and that's better I think it's better than battle four fives water yeah isn't the the thing with the water in this game wasn't it like server-side so everyone has the same waves and well yeah cuz on parcel storm yeah paracel storm the the waves would like because you could like hide behind them if you were in like a patrol boat or something to stop people shoot me yeah use them as cover Ramos yeah and there was also one on Caesar Shanghai where when the skyscraper came down it would send a massive wave across the map yeah that's it I think he's there there you go what happened to your med kit that just bounced off the desk and went over your head made of jello no we figured out they don't float or they don't go with the water and they made of jello yeah wow that's interesting right why don't I just get damage there come here Sunday you just take damage oh I'll be the experiment oh yeah there's guy in the roof he's just like looking down I can't no steam hisses he picked her again is he on the roof yeah he's looking through these these windows here up the top does that go all the way up are we gonna get shot on this cab ah it's fine don't worry is he up here don't know if he's still up here let's have a look are they rock there were steps there's no steps inside I thought it would be are they parachuting okay I'm right here they've got a spawn beacon somewhere is it what is that helicopter do rights mine now game we're in let's do this working it's just not working I'm sorry I know it put me through the full Oh teleported what is happening Jeff it's bad for four I guess there goes the bigger is the thing watch out for the Brawley boy is it gonna get this Hank that was close that was so close oh god what actually killed someone got the tank no way on the roof forget a guy idiot on the roof thank you now of all the hours that I've played before I'd never seen that happen really well I've never seen it killer tank they actually destroyed the tank that's mental this SKS guy started really is he still up there Russell my jimmies well we need to find this forum you condone yeah it's that I think they're spawning in from my over in like the damn River area right okay I need ammo I'm like no one ever drops I'm on this team today I'd give you some of mine but unfortunately the game doesn't support that what like sharing ammunition really yeah I'll be like here you go here's three bullets for you count them out for you I mean as cool as that would be I think maybe that's a bit too hardcore for a battlefield game now definitely not could you imagine it's like people thumbelina round with their bullets go an ego just imagine the character model just like Patton himself like go put that Magnum yeah pulling out spent casings out of his pockets there on the roof that we were you crashed the helicopter up oh yeah right there got one how was that ahead chopper just one of those moments when you just spamming fire and it just happens to the men in the head I'll go neither one there's another one I like suppression I'll drop in and get your home yes pay us guy what where did you help what you bucking bear what happened you but that's very odd camera so your body dropped down and I drop down to revive you and then it like bounced you back up to the roof I was always on the roof but like on my game was telling me oh you look killed by an SKS and then it was highlighting a tank in the distance is it achieved you're active BTI he's just holding that above his shoulder that's really weird as you say it's battlefield for expect the unexpected isn't it like basically free to play that hmm well if you've got I think you could get it on origin accessed on you which is what like 20 pounds a year I'm sure it's been in about 1500 like sales is right yeah it doesn't be it doesn't be the Humble Bundle sale that they did for bf3 during the back oh yeah what was that like three quid or something hello ego hackers have some free accounts yeah in hindsight it's such a great idea oh you dropped okay isn't it thanks babe now this is a bit got a bit chaotic here there's anti-air and a BTR and a guy coming up the stairs and another one there's two I'm reloading that for a surprise did you yeah okay yeah so loud I love that how did you survive I got lucky what's happened at ank have you got any anti-tank got c4 I think we can have to get pretty close like oh I go on a destroy mission Oh can you try if I make it work it's not started well he's got someone repairing him cam it's fine Tory I got in no camera right I'm prone in the grass he'll never see me did you make it I'm still alive 50 health I can just wait for regen cannae yep thanks battlefield nutrition what attrition right the tanks they it's well and truly buggered off now did you get any c4 on it but there is another one I can go no no go in they'll go in I'm still here coming if I left you behind I think I'm d-cup in the point before you get it I got it good job this destruction was brought to you by running out in the open I think there's more here stairs I'm coming back I'm gonna make the 200-meter journey all the way back these are my stairs basically this is where I live okay if you pitched your tent right at the top of it yeah there's more coming up oh they're coming across right ah this sks guy are you coming back um I've spawned in what's out there down there they're down there one death coming coming
