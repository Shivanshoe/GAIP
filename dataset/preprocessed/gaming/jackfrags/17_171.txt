as far as i can tell this game has absolutely no connection to pubg it might look the same it might play the same in some respects but in terms of the actual development i can't find anything there and in fact some pubg players who are still playing are now saying that they enjoy this game more than the current state of pubg i think that says something and i thought we'd take a look at it today this game is called super people now over the last couple of weeks you may have seen some streamers and content creators broadcasting this making sponsored content for it so i thought you know what there's got to be something here let's check it out now i know that the idea of another battle royale game doesn't exactly excite people the way it perhaps used to but sometimes there's a new one that comes along and captures people's attention and in my opinion providing it's got a good gameplay loop it runs well and it's accessible and it's got a chance to be good and that's how i'd currently describe super people a brand new battle royale game by developer wonder people they've got all sorts of people working there now it's currently enclosed beta testing and i have to say that my first impressions of it are quite positive on the surface you'd be forgiven for thinking well it looks very similar to pubg and it does a lot of the systems are the same same weapons especially the way the game looks in third person but perhaps i think a better comparison would be ring of elysium especially if you're talking about visuals the truth is though that the core gameplay elements are very similar in all of those games and super people doesn't change the formula up much when it comes to gameplay attachments and the circle that we're accustomed to what it does add though are classes and well super soldiers when you load into a lobby you're given one of 12 classes you're not entirely stuck with what you're given though you can then spend 100 gold coins to randomize your class once or 500 to outright pick which one you want and you gain the gold currency simply by playing the game so what are the classes about then do they actually add anything to the br formula well each one has a specific weapon that they favor as well as a specific set of traits and an ultimate ability what are these ultimates well the gatling soldier they've got a gatling gun obviously whereas the mobile striker has a very quick dash which lets them get over short distances really quickly there's also a nuclear strike more like an airstrike really and there's even a character that gets a monster jeep i'm not making this up it's important to know though that you don't get these abilities straight away you get them from leveling up your character during the game and in a match you gain xp by simply surviving getting kills and also the consumption of super capsules more on that in a second in theory the game promotes you surviving by guaranteeing that if you do you will get your ultimate ability at some point further improving your surviving skills getting kills helps as well and if you're racking up the kills then you're going to reach a higher level much faster than someone who isn't going for that action i mentioned super capsules and this is where it starts to get very unique in terms of how the gameplay works dotted around the map alongside the regular loot are three types of capsules red green and blue these correspond with your red green and blue traits or abilities finding and consuming a red capsule will give you one of these abilities and you can keep finding the same ones and level each up there are also other capsules that give you one random ability on any color and a gold capsule that will max out one random ability instantaneously leveling up also boosts main stats as well such as health and damage and certain characters even have abilities or traits that will increase damage when on rocky terrain or even near water and so knowing what other characters have at their disposal is definitely going to help you master the game now what also sets super people apart from some other similar br games is the crafting system throughout the world there are crafting items such as cloth nails leather and you can use these to craft improved items on the fly this could mean crafting a better specialized weapon or even crafting high-level backpacks and armor i think it's done in quite a simple easy to read manner to without the need for multiple menus you simply collect the items as you're going around and it tells you if you can upgrade them you hit the shortcut and it simply plays an animation for a few seconds and it's done what this does mean though is that while you do have to find guns and armor on the ground there are also going to be less situations later in the game where you're simply outgunned if you've been looting and fighting other players you're always going to be well geared towards the end of a game now we haven't really talked about the map just yet but overall i guess it's about the same size of erengel if we were gonna compare to pubg the good thing and the way that they're keeping the action flowing is that only a certain part of it is playable every match when you're flying into the game it would already start with a phase 1 zone which means that the action is already pushed up and you won't find yourself with long boring moments like you do sometimes in pubg where you're just looting for 10 minutes and nothing really happens the zone is also dynamic depending on how many players join the lobby and i think this is a great feature so if you only get a lobby with say 40 players the zone will accommodate for that so it doesn't feel empty i touched on the attachment system earlier being similar to other vr games and quite frankly it is if you have an ak for example you're going to want a muzzle or a compensator perhaps a red dot sight for an sks or a car you're likely to want a longer range scope and a cheek pad is this starting to sound familiar the gun player overall can be pretty tricky though with some of the guns having a fair amount of recoil so the attachments are going to play a fairly big part in how easy you find it and how controllable each weapon is you also have to take into account that it's not just the weapon you have but also those extra bonus stats that you get from leveling up and the same applies to any enemies that you'll come across they may have extra damage mitigation extra health and you need to bear all of that in mind there are consumables too that you can use during a round that are based around defense and offense for example the power energy bar gives you an extra 15 damage for 90 seconds and the speed energy bar gives you 15 movement speed for the same amount of time and these things of course can massively change an engagement and how you approach it wrapping things up when it comes down to it super people the gameplay loop felt incredibly familiar to me each game honestly at times it felt like i was playing pubg and that won't be a huge problem for a lot of people it's towards the later parts of the game though when players have got their abilities and perks that things perhaps start to swing more into the unique category i did find myself focusing too much on the gun play though i think that's just ingrained into me and in one engagement i really wish that i'd have used my ultimate which at the time was a smoke ability that could have really helped me out it's just about getting into that mindset for this game in my time with it though i didn't find the ultimates to be too much of a problem as they are fairly readable now super people does look like your cup of tea then you should be able to jump on it right now if you want to give the game a go you can head to the store page on steam request access to their current closed beta test and you'll get it for free that's how i got access and providing there's still enough capacity you should be able to get into without too much trouble and that's all bit of an interesting one this on the surface it could just look like a pubg knockoff but it's actually pretty fun we'll see how it develops see how it turns out and that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments below have you played this if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike
