hi everyone hope you're well and welcome to some gameplay of battlefield mobile now first off i want to say a big thank you to fluffy's life on twitter they actually recorded this gameplay posted it on twitter and i asked for permission to use it and they said that's fine so i haven't played this yet this is brand new footage recorded by someone else playing and recording the screen but of course this is pretty big battlefield news so i wanted to make a video on this and take a look at the game just do some basic first impressions so at the moment i think it only started around like 10 hours ago a play test began for this game and it's only on android devices right now but it will be on apple devices in the future and the play test right now is only available to people in indonesia and the philippines i'm sure there could be some way of using a vpn or an emulator to play if you're in a different country i haven't figured out how to do that yet but if you're in those countries downloading this on the play store looks like it'd be pretty easy because as i said you just sign up and it is free to play so as you can see this is grand bazaar i mean it doesn't look anywhere near as good graphically as bf3 did of course it's a mobile title and this is alpha gameplay as well so i assume that the graphics will advance and improve over time and there were some options earlier in the video too where you can set the graphical fidelity of the game so a bit of customization there based on your device if you've got an older device and it doesn't run so well you'll be able to tone down the graphics a bit and based on the notification in the bottom left-hand corner there it appears that this is running at medium graphics right now so when this player joined the game it was 32 players and they're in a squad if you look at the top right there two unnamed players i don't know if they're bots or are they just people who wish to remain anonymous on their mobile device maybe i presume with this being a mobile game it does have bots in but ui very basic right now from left to right we've got the small rocket launcher the grenade the primary weapon which in this case is an f2000 pistol and then a knife a bit of a fire fight going on here massive health bars and names on the screen hopefully you can customize this but remember that you're playing this on a mobile device it's going to be on a smaller screen most of the time so i guess that's just why everything needs to be so big you can see all the conquest flags there layout of the map different loadout options too presumably you can customize that and jump on a quad bike here so the developers of this are claiming that it will be a true to franchise version of battlefield conquest flags destruction sandbox gameplay nice little roadkill there with the quad bike too as they're beeping their horn now grand bazaar as you may recall doesn't have any air vehicles on it no little bird no attack helicopter no jets but i was on the subreddit the game and some users were claiming that there is actually flying controls in the options so when they reveal more of the game they show other maps i fully expect there to be planes and helicopters if they're truly going for that real battlefield experience on mobile you've really got to have that air vehicle element there i love the fact that there is a compass at the top of the screen too bf3 didn't have that as well as i remember maybe it had it on top of the map actually but that was really small and difficult to see but i mean that's front and center right there right at the top and we know that 2042 has a compass but it only looks like it's there when you aim down the site so it would be cool to know if you could select an option that permanently kept it on the screen i think a lot of players would like that so there is some destruction in this too and i've seen another video where there i'll put the e flag on this map and glen bazaar and they use the rocket launcher to shoot the size of the buildings if you play this map in bf3 you'll know exactly what i'm talking about because people would camp on the sides of those streets and a dead easy way to kill them would be to shoot the building above them and then it would rubble drop land on top of them and take them out and you can do that in this game yeah it's a bit more scripted and only in certain areas i don't expect that with this being a mobile game it will have the same level of destruction and flexibility that bf3 had but it's there to a certain degree and i'm sure that the developers will make it a bit more tactical in its placement so it makes sense for this game rather than just hey you can destroy everything not sure that's possible still this is just the beginning though and it makes me wonder if ea continued to put money into this and expand that developer studio what could it look like in a few years time it's made by a company called industrial toys so this has got nothing to do with dice or criterion completely different studio i'm sure they might go to dice for ideas or hey what did this tank look like or have we got the design of this map right whatever but it's made by industrial toys so nothing to do with the main game completely separate and thinking about it what other maps have they got planned to add to this game because it's got this bf3 vibe so it would be super easy to go in and have some of the fan favorite bf3 maps like saint crossing caspian border damage operation metro the grind best that that is a lot of people really enjoy that style of gameplay so those are the main ones i think they'd go for but with this being a mobile title and it being separate bit of an experiment perhaps maybe they could throw in that portal angle add maps from other battlefield games it doesn't have to just be bf3 they could grown something from bf4 like parasol storm introduced boats some bad company 2 maps erica harbor valparaiso striker carkin from bf2 i feel like that type of map would work perfect for a mobile game like this and game modes too doesn't just have to be conquest it seems like the biggest competitor to this at least in the western audience will be cod mobile and that's already a very robust decent offering for a mobile game they've got zombies they've got multiplayer they've got a br in there as well so maybe they could do some kind of mini vr full battlefield on mobile just the thought but on the surface it seems like all the components are here for a battlefield game on mobile the dna is there you've got squads you've got flags you've got vehicles different loadouts options gadgets that you can choose part of my ignorance i don't really play that many mobile games at all but is there anything like this on mobile right now that's comparable has anyone made a good battlefield clone just under a different name let me know down in the comments below and we can see a bit of the career progression at the bottom here different sniper rifles med kits lmgs some kind of a uav drone there pp2000 ammo crate a lot of this will be very familiar to you if you've played bf3 and they did say that it's all cosmetic as well in terms of the stuff you can buy so fingers crossed no pay to win fluffy also recorded some of the progression here for the weapons so on the f2000 for example everything that you would expect is there i think so you've got some weapon attachments like sight compensators but you've also got additional specifications for the guns so you can change how their handling is you want quick aim do you want slight recall reduction do you want improved moving accuracy there is a number of attachments here that you could apply to your loadout bit more customization for the player so there it is quick first look at battlefield mobile again big thanks to fluffy for letting me use his video first impressions from me looks like battlefield there's a huge audience for mobile gaming especially in asia and russia so i think this is a smart move from ea will it replace the main battlefield game no of course not but could be an interesting alternative when you're on the go or just bored yeah do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] [Applause]
