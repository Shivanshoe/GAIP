hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some warzone solo gameplay i didn't do any live commentary for this one i was just playing and recording so i wanted to put some stuff over the top talk to you guys i've got some topics i wanted to discuss and i thought this would be a good backdrop because it is quite a good game dropped on the train here actually quite a hot spot in solos you don't have to get people dropping train in trios and quads but on solos for some reason people just they just go for it i picked up a couple of uh kills there i know there's one more guy on the train here rambo with the right chilled what can i do i was just waiting out but i was absolutely determined to kill this dude shooting them in defeat they've got no armor so let me take my chance here hit him with a long shot 58 meters with the old bullfrog not bad at all but today is the fourth of july so if you're american and you care about that you celebrate that happy fourth i know a lot my audience are american so i hope you have a great day whatever it is that you're doing partying barbecuing i don't know enjoy yourselves that guy didn't enjoy himself though headshot while getting the loadout can't stop using the swiss though easily easily my favorite sniper rifle love that thing i heard someone here creeping around i think they were behind that fence but i didn't want to run around because of course i'm going to give the game away if i start doing that and i don't think i've got ghosts here either so they'd definitely see me on the heartbeat sensor if they had one i wanted to move around a bit pop the daddy can we find them and they decided to hop on the quad bad move i'm using the ak here i will do a proper video on the ak this one didn't really have enough ak kills in it by the end so i didn't want to use this one and this guy came along on the bike give me a little tickle there with the ak ak is really good cold war one not mw1 mw weapons have really really fallen out of fashion though and i don't know whether that's a conscious design choice by raven or activision to go okay right make the cold war guns really good and hopefully people play the game some more or something there's lots of conspiracy theories about that especially with the blueprints that they put in the stores but i mean i haven't like i haven't really used a modern warfare weapon as a primary since the amax nerf and before that it was cold war weapons right because they've been so strong i remember when cold war came out and they were just really bad and they didn't fit in the meta at all but then they started changing the suppressors and the barrels and it was like okay cold war guns are pretty good this dude here though man just kept facing me and shooting i thought after i cracked them maybe they'd start but now i just kept going luckily i've got self-rest it's always one of the first things that i try and buy when i play solo selfres sometimes i bite before loadout as well and i thought you know get a position where they won't expect me pop the daddy so i don't make noise on that tin roof get up high get the angle and got the kill i'm right on the edge of the zone here 22 people left solo matches go like this now like they just they're just dead by i don't know mid game i do really enjoy them though sometimes end of circle two circle three lots of people die i do think they could make some changes but this here man oh what can you do i've got a uav up with that player head ghost just camping in a corner right on the edge of the zone xm4 meta build nothing i could have done there but if you notice the timer there was only 10 seconds before the gulag closed and i was right on the edge there so it just threw me straight back into the game so definitely got a bit lucky with that one i'll take that one as a victory and i got even more lucky here loadout came in right on time and i just i've got to go for it rightly there's so many here but just have to go for it it's my re-game and i just picked anything beams and dreams there we go got the pharah and the mac 10. i kind of wish i'd picked a ghost class there but i just didn't and i just hung around in this corner for a bit didn't have heartbeat sensor either on that i rushed it this guy rocks up in the attack rover not ideal when the zone is that small i've got no ammo so i just thought i gotta go for this let's go let's get some ammo and get back in quickly as possible inside got the ammo back in my corner we're in a much much better position now right eight kills on the board there's only 10 other players left i didn't really need to move because look at the zone right it's going to push me further into the tv station i'm happy with that i think i heard a guy above me there was definitely a guy over there by the bike you see the bike on the mini-map came in i can see him moving there i pushed up just got ruined by the pharah they did nerf the pharah but it's negligible i don't know what percentage of recoil they added to it you just don't notice it especially on mouse it's still arguably the best assault rifle in the game maybe c58 starts to challenge that now but i think it's a preference thing because the rate of fire and the damage right the recoil is a bit different on the c58 but the fire is just a monster still don't they nerfed it enough to be honest i wanted to do a video where i went back and used some mw weapons just to see if they were still competitive could i actually win a solo match using like an m4 and an mp5 or an hdr or something like that m13 m13 is still really good but i think that'd be quite interesting but you guys see what happened with apex by the way absolutely crazy i was just reading about this so i didn't realize titanfall 1 multiplayer only game people still play it but on pc apparently i've not had any experience of this myself but from what the article said for months and months it's just been plagued by hackers and they have a way of ruining the lobbies and the game has just been completely chalked and some fans think that respawn aren't doing enough to remedy it so some hackers actually managed to get into the apex legends system and you know you've got that message of the day that pops up from the different playlists they changed it so it says titanfall 1 is under attack so is apex legends and some playlists don't work and it links to a website it's like save titanfall.com because these people just want titanfall 1 to be playable again and because this hacking situation apparently it's just not i'm coming from an ignorant position here because i don't have any self-experience of it but that sounds pretty mad that they've actually managed to do that hack apex legend so they've changed the message of the day and the playlist and they just don't work absolutely insane crazy that people can do that i picked up a couple kills there making my way through the tv station i know there's a dude above me there's that guy and someone else and i just don't know where the other guy is they've got to jump now but as soon as i shoot the other player knows where i'm at so that was a bit risky but i didn't really have a choice right nothing on heartbeat where's the last guy hiding somewhere play this side the building a little bit left in let's have a peek there we go started by the fence they landed a thermite on me there but unfortunately just didn't want to shoot kid and i got the war bang through the fence conscientious objector maybe perhaps they were trying to win the game by just using thermites or something maybe a challenge i'm not sure but there is another one in the bag i know it's pretty chill video today but i've had a manic weekend i didn't manage to get a video out yesterday and i thought this would be a nice chill vibe for the sunday and there we go that's it next week definitely some more warzone gameplay i don't think there's anything big coming up for warzone next week maybe some event i don't know i really want a new map already you know like that's what i really want for warzone there's also going to be some battlefield gameplay and maybe some battle 2042 news on the 8th ea are doing a live stream the future of fps is called and it's got the general manager from dice and it's got someone from apex so if there's any battlefield 2042 news i'll definitely do a video on it my live stream and i'll keep you guys in the loop with that said thanks to all these absolute legends for using my code in the cod store as always you're the best love you lots if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
