you guys plates keeper Jack thank you if you want to hit here yeah we want to get we gotta get place he's not gonna screw this time he's just gone over here season for his different yeah for that do you think they reset the skill based matchmaking when there's a nicely tuned it I think they reset is cuz I remember my first games were pretty good and then they games after that were rough pretty wrong add a reset it it's away okay I'll get you a V so I was playing with some American and players union and they had a theory that every squad you make gets its own unique SP mm rating yeah I don't know if I believe no way so many theories I they would have anyway it's still so much data that assume yet she pushed him along in this wall I didn't know we're coming that's tearing those trailers by the way again you want to wave the dick start or should we just go for this oh good push in I gots turns one at wall outside like I didn't get any hits then ones in between I'm gonna back wall one down he's gonna rest he's gonna rest straightaway let's go yeah you good you good did you win the fight there yeah yeah go I'm going Joe oh there's are you look out for the eatin too far you get your get here Joe come back Arnie some people were telling me if you survive the Google I can come back you keep your phone is there any truth no so here's another conspiracy for you there's some American pro players that have decided that there's also a thing called loadout SP mm and depending on if you're using stuns or the thing is like I could like I could almost see cuz like arguably like every different combination of players life is gonna play very definitely and have a very different like skill level I'd start it being productive for them to put that in but theoretically they could have like just a one number racing for every every unique pairing of players that played Wow I don't believe them I don't think it's true but so I think it's just based on your recent performance I think it's either yeah I think it's it's like some sort of multiplication between their kill death ratio your score per minute and your previous like 10 games that's why my guess with anymore it's just one right there's one look at the bus down one in the bass on the right as well I would love to get that load out we can go to that we can pay this building mini I've actually ruined my sniping abilities by spending too much time sniping on na because you had any more yeah more I know like how to lead for a hundred mils after the ping but not much last ping stress still a guy on this side of the wall and orange somewhere looking yeah maybe he's gone got you backed up should do that you killed here we have to head that way anyway I'm gonna go up here zoom around in Sumer oh yeah I might gonna get

the building so I'm gonna go and wait for them oh yeah see those guys it's gonna write as well one time one as he went in down one else he went in I can push that if you want I don't have a boyish wife and come running out okay hey Rosie I hate them go from storage in the back that's I couldn't full self rest it's my oh you have a mom no believe me with that nice you cocky like I might do yeah

what is like we can't even get it yeah look is it oh you can get it you can get it fun okay yeah looks yeah looks like they're yeah the other day I was fighting we were down exactly where that loadout drop is and I was like there's got to be a team camping in these bushes lo and behold there's three guys one in each bush kill all of them and then there's another team in the bushes next to them that wipes us I couldn't believe my eyes yeah working together I think they were all so sneaky they didn't know each other with that it was just under words sat next to each other oh he was then he was worthy do I'll just go there to stop if you know you're nearly there yeah almost this is all been looted though so I doubt there's any cash oh yeah let's check in though I've got a little bit of money

think we can do most shots care package I've ever seen in my life is so short should we just form a chain and just hold on to each other no can we just go can we just Yolo it and if the game ends diamonds yummy I've tested it you got four seconds and that's when you're a meter away from the bartender that's debated Tom Hardy just bait all right can we get up on the sky for our lifestyle scav way out they do really be that way physics are do they work okay yeah cool thanks go not as if we're already on the ropes and you and you've scuffed our loadout job now you have to go and do this

never happened no I have learned that car where the real winners out of this yeah that's an expensive insurance bill Ladda knows and yank at wagon things remember yank at yes yeah that one yeah stop maybe I remember I don't remember that well you know [Applause] I think crazy frog was the first name dude on people with mobile yeah the power they're trying to get us killed actually has what's going on okay start moving towards that shop and getting ready to buy me back the one far away that's what we'll get our loadout alright alright you don't want to get at this chopper to your right now cuz I think Kings are gonna push they're relatively soon like sir okay well we're back in the game here boys but back in back in business they wanted you know what the game has said killed us more than any players they don't want to see us winning I'm telling you man hey is absolute hater hey J can get this one through the wall Ryan no you can't if we need any more on the plate shall I buy some or do you want to get UAV alright I'm going to sweat loadout know someone sniping in this yeah ramparts uh yeah yeah could you see what we got in the area okay okay oh there's that guy in this building out there mr. Riley a lot of people out it's nice to me again I'm gonna fire pressing for orange oh I just want your red marker but it is that a Steamworks thought that's what that is that was beautiful one of that boys was the back of the house I gave him a little little armor crack ho Noren was a madman playing they're fine they're fine I don't know where this night the big snipers are coming from Jack watch out I got snipe there I gots neither okay I don't know I think it came from ramparts like towards the cast of The Gulag so fat that all I could think it's big snow looks like they're big though these aren't just Snipes she's the big big snakes don't actually say anyone at the gulag like I don't believe it someone was sniping me with it why isn't there three sighs I don't know maybe they've already pushed and there's an alternate universe oh snap well this is fun shows like I'm playing popular run the writing right oh yeah I I did him just not as hard as he hit me he everyone the big stuff sorry man hey still in peak in that window Vic yeah do we okay they have many big Snipes which billion push they're gonna get pushed up soon and for second side I'm a broke on him this bit here on orange yeah they're getting right they go far right actually I see you see Mario in blue jacket I guess thanks Ralph do we want to pull back early and thinking that's what I was thinking so think if one of us down now it's just gonna be like I kind of want to just go and like clear up top and then around that's a smart play I think we should someone just sniped me from blue and that love is in front of me on the dirt there's someone appeared right on the rocks here Danger Close okay wait we have the hold now cuz I've got no plates lefty yeah bastards with the snipes man I think we have to push blue kill them get their plates let's go right let's get in there watch out it's knocking come on we gotta push off this now alright that fighting so Jack far-right button just ignoring him okay bear in mind that they're out that way right yeah good good cause guess what [Music] don't see you they know where are they I don't know behind it some where you came from they're certainly now there's might be now I'm conscious game as this well I mean you're in the best spot I'm in an awful spot here you might have to play for yourself no way laughter edge of zone just here right yeah just bear in mind nice suburb ramparts sod okay um Jack I'm gonna trap that I'm gonna have to come on I'm be tonight oh I would say back the three men sniper teams down there you should out stay low just state like yeah so what you want on the ramparts at all yeah ramparts run bus orange mark over Jack worried about this team that pushing a behind us I'm gonna drop down game their game for me go down a guy on the ramparts and he fell down what here push someone else got him jumping off jack they get a job ops team get ready for it can you get to me still I've got to place if you want no I can't I can't get up do you know I can't get up to you you just screwed them up yeah no they're running running there Jack across them I'm dropping there's someone behind me firing very hit finish nice you could try and look at the place teamate right over here somewhere orange you'll be pushing on the low ground sod yeah I think so longer Logan Jack can throw party two of the other teams so yeah don't really okay I'll try and help you solve I got someplace of them then you're screwed then stun I can't come up to you I'm fine I can say oh I can stay low I mean the circle might move to you after this one you never know you can go on the floor in circle okay I'm wondering if that team the three months neither team is pushing around on the bottom if you're against it qo and if so although right now okay if they start shooting I'm just gonna push and just go for it if I can get them to even peek check and stay here in the meantime and then you can look down on them Jack yeah there's a total percent no one behind you start finish team that's the one guy down TV one and they're in front of Jack somewhere bothered on that high ground still III III so oh yeah I know you're right you're right if you under there like this thought I reckon I think they okay around there one day maybe drop off their minds my mind - let's finish one I finish mine you got a better idea I'll be moving now they are moving there's still one edge think you know everyone yeah - peeking over c1 he's gonna get caught by the gas it's moving pretty fast you see him stop stop all right maestro they'd wanted to already drop down yeah I think that's that same guy you like stayed up on the road laughs ahead we're running up that help well let me leave sure I don't know why you can't leave like nothing should be able to do it they want to force your head down and window again as close one wasn't it boys and girls very close we're gonna drop a second Cod points code in the chat right now 2400 cod points or PC let's come first serve Congrats if you get it exams to Nvidia and PC specialist for sponsoring this one as well Xander should I use AR and SMG or they are SMG with HDR that's how you're playing Xander in trios I like to use assault rifle and sniper in quads I like I like to use assault rifle SMG she you tend to have more close-range fights in quads I was very sway much wasn't it it's fun though you know I I prefer it when games are like that when they're challenging will be so cool about it for the game but they won't to imagine a mode where your loadout was completely random let me see them right low that you just open it and it just gave you something like max attacks quit just random that'd be so cool every player has to run to blow down completely you need I don't know be so much fun so there's so many little things I feel like they can do this spice up the game so much but just I feel like triple-a publishers shouldn't never do it it's a shame I don't know why they keep taking out game modes and putting others in it yeah that makes it keep player base on like where they need it to be to keep certain times down but yeah if they got rid of skill based matchmaking they could put as many modes as they want in the game they say they've got like 70 million players it's cross-platform with this you know would there be a problem finding games I don't know see you later I thought who knows hello renegade [Music] ala Reza thank you for the fire that's very kind don't know what you guys want to do let's go back in that back in the after we got a decent success rate -
