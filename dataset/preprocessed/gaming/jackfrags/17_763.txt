his modern warfare battle royale finally confirmed well you be the judge let's take a look at this so season two has just launched and there's a ton of new stuff in the game but when you first load it up you're greeted with a very interesting cinematic there's a small standoff in an airport terminal with some soldiers and when their teammate is killed you can quite clearly hear one of them saying gas is closing in we need to exfil now okay that on its own might not be that exciting but afterwards you see the new operator goes to coming to the shot and when speaking to price over the radio he says something is going wrong in the dansk they're targeting their own and then the shot pans out to a very large area with gunfights and explosions going off all over the place and finally here's the kicker a plane then flies over and you can see four soldiers jumping out the back and pulling their parachutes if you focus on the background - I'd say that this is the most obvious indication it's a battle royale there's a big ring of green gas closing in on the map that soldier referenced gasps it's obvious that that's what's happening here we can see multiple squads on the ground fighting against each other we can see a buggy driving off we can see the AI a V or what looks like a tank rolling into the battle we can see small explosions going off perhaps artillery and also multiple helicopters flying around the sky this has me really excited and if you'd be so kind do let me know in the comments below what would you want out of a call of duty modern warfare battle royale what features would you want to see in there how many players would it have to be would it have cross platform or it have respawns all that stuff let me know down below now I know the battle royale for modern warfare has been rumored for a while but this might be the first official acknowledgement from modern warfare itself we'll have to see so as I said at the start the second season pass is now live it was released today and with it we got plenty more content to get our hands on I've been playing it for most of the day to give you guys some impressions and gameplay footage and a big thanks to Activision for sponsoring this video so let's start with the new maps first of all and wanted them arguably one of the more well known maps from Modern Warfare to its rust rust is an incredibly small map I would say probably a little bit bigger than your average gunfight map and it definitely became a bit of a meme when it came to 1v ones of course you've got the classic 1v1 Leon rustboro or something like that I'm sure you've heard the term thrown around before either way the map was released with modern warfare 2 so it's quite fitting that it's going to be in the newest modern warfare game it's been outfitted for not only the standard modes but also gun fight too it's also exactly how you expect it to be absolutely manic spawns are not great at the best of times in Call of Duty but rust really does take it to an extreme don't get me wrong there were lots of players who love that sort of utterly manic gameplay and this map definitely stays true to the original it's got a fresh coat of paint here but rust is absolutely still rust now alongside rust we've got a brand new multiplayer map called atlas superstore and if the name wasn't enough of a giveaway this map is set in the Isles of a giant superstore because why not it definitely gives a different setting than most of the other maps that are currently in the game and I really enjoyed playing on this one the map has got quite a few distinctive lanes on it which is really how most older Call of Duty maps were set out surprisingly though there's still a fair bit of verticality to the map but you can get over the boxes and shelves in the middle it does make for a bit of a campus dream on certain modes though with only a very small portion of the map actually outside the store the store is more likely an adaptation of one of these SpecOps locations though which is a trend that we've already seen in the game as if those two maps weren't enough on day one we get another brand new map as well this time a new ground war map called the Zhukov boneyard this map takes place in a large airplane junkyard I definitely got Conair vibes from the first time I loaded it up maybe that was just me it's sadly the map that I've played the least so far though because it's really hard to get into a game on this map the way that you search for games in Cod means that you can't just pick a certain map to play and well that leads to a bit of frustration trying to get the map that you want I really think for ground war they should just do dedicated play lists when they bring out a new map nonetheless I did get to play a small amount on this one and while I didn't enjoy it as much as at the superstore I think it's a good addition to the ground war map pool there are quite a lot of areas where you're out in the open of course as you move between the plane wreckage which can be frustrating at times because of those killstreaks but I think I need a bit more time with this map to fully form a fair opinion I do remember a boneyard mission from the modern warfare campaign too so I wonder if it's based on that or at least a homage to it I'm sure that there was a map similar to this in modern warfare 2 as well now we even get some brand new gunfight maps to gun fight is definitely my favorite game mode in modern warfare Bazaar is one of these plenty of maps on the first day and the new season but that doesn't mean that it's all we're getting during the season we're also getting another map called candle hideout so look out for that when Infinity Ward decides to launch it all right enough about maps for now let's talk about the new weapons there are two of them that you can play with right now one of them is the growl 5.56 assault rifle and the other is the strike at 45 SMG the growl unlocks that past tier 15 and the strike at a tier 31 both of these weapons are free and can be earned just by playing the game I tried both of these guns out for a while and in fact all the footage in this video was with both of the new weapons the growl is a lightweight assault rifle to the point that actually felt a lot like an SMG when I was using it I did feel a little bit weak at times with it though but perhaps I just need a bit more time with it to unlock of you of those attachments and spec it out power life and then the actual SMG the striker is labeled as a hard-hitting and long-range SMG and I did feel as though it had a decent range to it I probably enjoyed this gun the most I'm not sure it would replace my trusty mp5 though only time will tell there's another weapon coming during the season too but it's currently listed as classified so we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that moving on to the new modes and playlists available they were going to be plenty of new wants to play over the course of the season but there are two available straightaway that you can try today the first is gun fight tournament and that's a limited time mode that puts 32 teams of two against one another in a tournament kind of format it sounds interesting all of those people who were playing gun fight in getting win after win now will have a way to challenge themselves over the course of a small tournament I like the idea of this so it will be interesting to see how its received and then there's the Call of Duty League rule set playlist which mimics all of these settings weapons maps and modes played in the official cod eSports league and while that may not be for everyone I think it does give the average player a good insight into what weapons and modes the pros play and I think some players may find it more balanced than the default modes we also know about modes that are coming later in the season too there's one called demolition which will make an appearance and it seems like that sort of similar to Search and Destroy with two teams against each other with the attacking team needing to destroy the other teams bomb sites infected ground war will also be available this sounds crazy and it means that you'll need to hold off the infected horde until the time expires infected players will have limited load outs but increased movement abilities so it poses a pretty interesting balance shift and lastly for the confirmed modes we have nvg reinforced which is a hybrid mode that blends elements of domination and search and destroy Infinity Ward have already confirmed that we should expect more modes alongside these confirmed ones during the rest of the season and that sounds good to me we're also getting a few new operators with the release of season 2 you'll be able to play as the one and only Simon Ghost Reilly from 2009's modern warfare 2 I would say ghost is just as iconic as any loved Call of Duty character oddly though he isn't wearing the same masks that he's known for wearing so it does look a bit different also he's got swole not quite sure why that is but during the season we're going to get few extra operators down the line Talon and mace with all of that is of course the new battle puss 2 which comes with a host of free and premium cosmetic items and it costs 1,000 Cod points which equates to around $10 now finishing up today we're just going to jump back to battle rail for a second because combine what we said earlier with the in-game cinematic and all the rumors there's also a new section on multiplayer that simply says classified and I think that it would be fair to say at this moment in time that the rumored battle rail mode is in fact real and by the sounds of it it could be coming very soon in fact on PC the download size for me today was almost 70 gig for the patch that's really big and I wonder if that's because maybe they've included more files they're related to a potential battle royale mode whichever way you look at it and for better or worse it looks like maybe we are actually going to get that soon and I for one am really interested to see if it's true what it can come up with as I said earlier let me know down below what you guys would want out of a modern warfare battle well let's see we can get a discussion going in the comments tomorrow about 8 p.m. GMT I'll be doing a modern warfare livestream on youtube so watch out for that we'll be checking out all the new content playing it live and I'll be interacting with you guys in the chat and playing for a couple of hours so it should be good fun get any calendar 8 p.m. GMT tomorrow with that said I hope you enjoyed this one guys leave a like if you did dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the
