hi everyone and gone and done it there is a christmas game mode for the game in battlefield portal attack of the elves this is an official nice game mode i've not probably had a golden yet so it's going to be my first time playing it i think it's a take on the infected game mode where one team play as the the naughty elves and the other team play as santa with a machine gun and the goal of the elves is to convert all the santas by knifing them with their candy canes it's only available in portal but i thought you know as soon as this is new we'd check it out give it a shot you guys are welcome to join as well when i'm queueing up for this and yes it does indeed look terrifying it looks absolutely crazy now before we get into today's festivities let's see what i did there i have to say a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring this stream and video they kicked off their holiday sale today and they've got lots of big discounts on all the games that are on the store and also they're offering a coupon which is like a 10 coupon and i think you can use this on any title that's over 14.99 and it stacks so let's say that you bought 10 games that were 14.99 or more you get a 100 discount so you know maybe there's a couple of things on there that you wanted to pick up in the past haven't been able to whatever you might be able to use that now and i think you get that 10 coupon as many times as you want as well as long as you're buying a game over 40.99 so a big thanks to epic game store for sponsoring this one and if you guys pick up anything in the store do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that and the link is down in the description below to the store if you want to check it out for yourself so with that said we're going to see if we can play again the tack of the elves the elves fell into a tank of special eggnog and are not themselves in fact they've become quite vile and are threatening the seasonal festivities well we'll see we'll see how it goes i did read on twitter that some people were having problems with this game mode where it wasn't ending i don't know if they fixed that yet but we'll see convert all the festive fighters okay right so i've got a candy cane here and a 14 remaining oh my god do they have the mask on maria maria i just want to see your face i think they do have the mask on i want to see the mask hey devil move come here oh my god that's horrific look at this i suppose we're gonna have to just grapple up there and try and kill them oh did my drunk my grapple just did some damage there i can't hook up there for some reason okay so we're one floor below them right now look at this it looks like something out of heat remember heat with robert de niro and al pacino okay i think that guys yeah so that santa just got converted into an elf they're camping up there by the looks of it how are we going to get up there there's only 12 left but this round must have only just started then i think we climb up a bit so we can get higher i want a candy cane someone so bad maria oh no i missed it that was my chance it'd be cool if they added sound effects as well like that'd be neat okay okay it doesn't seem fair that they can just go and hide at the top maria look at this that is horrific no you leave the elf alone oh yeah this guy get this guy one above me okay here we go this is like the most awkward thing in the world ever they get lmgs as well this is totally not fair this is ridiculous are we ever gonna get up there hey jason thank you for becoming a member raphael cheers for the five keep up the great content cheers how how we gonna do this i don't they've cheesed the system here haven't they the santa claus has cheesed the system the gun is called the gift wrapper as well nice please look at them all we're gonna need like a combined attack or something aren't we hmm get him oh no it was like switching around with my grapple that was so annoying cs 1.6 zombie mode on gas station crack yeah zombie mode and counter strike was great i used to love that so much man i used to play that all the time it made custom maps for it as well he used to make big maps it had all sorts of custom rules on it as well your elf gaze spots all the festive fighters okay so they just killed us all they get to 50. not a good first experience right there guys i have to be honest the fact that they could just camp at the top there not a big fan of that hopefully i load in first and i get to be one of the santas because then i can just machine gun everyone a random frank stephen king what's up guys hey soggy richard hadley thank you for coming second dk what's going on here we're playing the festive game mode no i know what's gonna happen on this map they're just gonna camp on the crane assassin squad i think i loaded in first hopefully i don't get i don't want to be an elf i want to be a santa it was like a penguin with a machine gun then as well did you guys see that what the hell now don't leave the game was it max ghost dark thank you for coming guys greetings from argentina hey maxie welcome i want to see the penguin with the machine gun again i'll spawn in 29 seconds oh okay my lmg's got christmas wrapping on it does this have a ladder it doesn't does it we don't get a grapple either with these guys this is the play isn't it get the high ground the owls have arrived look look at rao what is that that's the stuff of nightmares right there that is the stuff of nightmares i can't aim down the sight either okay so you can't actually aim move to that location what the i don't see the elves how many are there two guys don't go stay but you see zombie movies right you gotta stick together but the elf can go there wait wait the elves have smoke grenades oh no oh no guys it's surrounding us oh there's four l's okay no no no no not like this he gone one made it up here what i wish they made little noises oh whenever you see them hang on am i going to run out of ammo oh are you kidding me just turn around guys how did you one two three four there's five teammates on that roof and not one of them turned around am i living in a dream world i mean what's what's happening okay i need to get revenge i bet the second i go up there instantly dead i literally press f nice guys please don't worry i think we're gonna overcome them here i feel like this map they can't really cheese it because they can't get on the crane so it's just a matter of time before the l's take down the santa claus let me tell you like that is um that is unbelievable isn't it guys like how did i even get turned then there was so many elves there i'm actually human yeah and i just instantly died the second i try and get someone it's because i didn't make the noise okay fine i'll start making the noises god if that's what you really want but they've pushed him off let's go let me spawn let me spawn yes you never seen an elf like this you kidding there was one there was one left they literally won with one left i didn't make the noise either guys i'm so sorry if i get to become an elf again i will make the noise i promise [Music] but solomon's theme [Music] oh this is bad they can climb okay so the best thing that santa can do here is just climb up the there it is look arctic assassin how do i get that do i just have that it's a penguin with an assault rifle and an underbarrel grenade launcher why isn't that in the game mode like that should be in the game mode right [Music] that's what i want to see i want to play as a tiny penguin with a machine gun or a flamethrower playing through be better wouldn't it all right okay so you can't go the thing then oh is the tower accessible nice did you make it accessible everyone's going for it i think it's out of bounds yeah there's no way oh this though nice you didn't think about this did you come on we're gonna go up here guys this is the defensive position if there's an elf up here i'm gonna go nuts this is where we fight santa yes this is where we win the elves have arrived where are they i think there's one over there certainly sounds like it doesn't it there's one i don't want to waste ammo though because i i don't know if you get the ammo back afterwards oh there's loads already what no i'm not sure this is a good spot now either because they can just grapple hook to like four different oh they just got one ah how this is gonna be over quickly oh are you happy now chap on the roof got one hit and you know good enough this is really difficult i thought this would be super easy when you're playing as the santa claus but so far i've failed i'm a failure guys i i don't want to say to you i'm so sorry there's only four left oh the elves have absolutely smashed them where are they down here oh downstairs downstairs lads down the stairs let's go is this what an elf sounds like i've got no idea there's one left oh there we go that's it and these rounds are quick i'd have preferred it if these rounds went on a bit longer to be honest oh so i think this is bugged isn't it this is what they were talking about so the round should end now but it doesn't oh just leave queue up again hype is getting filled by this mode hey quinny what's up i'm good thank you how are you stop the l sounds they're freaking me out why do you think there's an elf behind you marcus right now in the corner of your room with a knife oh not this map not like this oh it ended okay good there it is again was that a different version i look like a different version good good good right well we know what we have to do we have to become the cheese climb all the way to the top and that way they can't possibly win look everyone's doing it they all know elves are evil yeah they they fell into some eggnog we read the description were you not here when i read the description i had become the cheese cracking cheese grommet absolutely fueling like all right let's do it yes yes just try and get me now elf try and get us you idiots what are you doing down there you'd all be slain by the elves you'll be slain by the elves look to the east at first light and you'll see an elf i don't see any you got you know the strat don't you go you know the strap these poor souls down here they don't know no dice stay back demon no oh thank god for that careful of the explosive barrel there but interesting strap those guys are employed there they've gone for the red thing they've decided you know what red thing that's the play i don't think i've killed a single elf guys what's wrong with me can i get on the crane oh please no please no else the hell was that yes oh i've got a taste for elf blood now it's over alright i i want to get across this okay hey no what yes okay right now can they get can they get me here i don't know i'm actually trying to cheese the game mode guys i don't know what to tell you further longer go the better yes right try and get me now the elves the elves are revolting after years of wrapping presents that's it isn't it there was a revolution in santa's workshop a revolt in the rebellion and the elves come on elves you gotta do better than this we've only got a kill four more right it's time to become an elf hunter i'm getting bored now else where are you i got one kill guys i'm so proud of myself james kingston isn't he a free runner that makes youtube videos and he goes up to like really tall places with a gopro and every time i watch it i get that funny feeling in the place that shall not be named yeah that's that guy isn't it hey joe i challenge you to get a grapple kill as an elf it's possible it's a two shot kill isn't it no no no not noshaw again this is for tonight kabal yeah this is the new fortnight mode for fortnight they basically made fortnite in fortnite crazy uh sinji thank you for the 17 months as a member are there any other maps was it just those four three it seems like infected rip off yeah it's based off infected in it it's just like zombie mode but it's an official nice one and they've got custom masks for the models no i've started as an elf haven't i fml does it have to be like this oh i think the louder i scream and the more strange the noises are the more damage i do i feel like that's that's the way of the elf that's why the rebellion occurred in the first place angelo you haven't changed your notepad card i don't care about it i literally don't care i'm never going to change it it's always going to be the guy from the cover and it's always going to say new gun on the block unless i get a unique one please dice let me get my knife out nice we talked about this didn't we i'm a head elf what does that mean you are a head elf does that mean i've got most kills i've got more kills as an elf than i ever did with a machine gun yes yes gonna be okay gonna be okay i just wanna turn you into an elf and put you on the shelf that's all it is there's kids out there who need presents we've got enough santa claus we need some elves on the shelf okay so if you die become an elf just know that you're making a kid's life better somewhere can you be revived in this i don't know blood for the elf oh squad leader there we go fidget great way to chill after having a job interview how did it go buddy hope it went all right for you santa think about the elves think about else yes no elf off not like this we lost i'm not the elf that i thought i was they called me a leader that was a failure oh so if you were okay cool i get it thank you chat if you're a squad lead elf you get smoke that's it that's the play i didn't i didn't know that uncle awesome have you tried the realism mode in portal i tried um what's the guy's name karamat karmat i tried his milsim mode when it first came out i've not tried it since i think i'm gonna do a video on it [Music] what era do i want the next battlefield game to be set in i mean that's a very difficult question just modern day i like modern day battlefield games or cold war i think like a cold war battlefield would be pretty cool they kept it grounded in reality you know thought about this many times on my videos over the past like i don't know five years since when did battlefield 1 come out 2016 so six years wait yeah nearly six years i'm good at maths me karma cut yeah there we go i don't just want to camp again when i'm actually on the elf hunter this santa claus ain't afraid noel these owls used to work for me i'm gonna make him pay think about all those kids that won't get presents this year because these elves have decided to quit their jobs i'm not having it back in the workshop back in the workshop i'm going to send you to mrs claus if you're not careful you don't want to see mrs claus on a bad day don't want to see mrs claus gotta reload elf hunter no no i'm coming for you where'd you go where'd you go oh it's a horror game now this is where i make my stand you're coming behind me as well 12 more kills look at them all gotta reload run out of time i'd stay back stay back back in the workshop send you back to the north pole seven more kills you've got two at a time this is unfair you can gang up on santa like that you think you can gang up on santa i'll take you with me three more kills and i would have done it [Music] so close i was so close i think i've had the pkp then they're all dead [Music] oh battle of the bulge okay we haven't played this one yet i would like to see the penguin santa needs to lose some weight santa's look i mean he's looking pretty trim here to be fair i hope my neighbors didn't hear that i'm probably wondering why i'm screaming santa i'll take you with me let's do it elves have arrived lads come on we've got important stuff to do here i mean you could go around as a squad and just eradicate all the elves i think that's an interesting tactic crossroads here this is it boys this is how we win we just go around as a big group and there's no way the house can get us there's one here oh that was close elf here you're gonna regret the day you revolted against santa say good night elf could you just like spawn campbell i'm here i like this guy he's down for it but okay look if you how could we possibly lose right honestly unless they use smokes if i went to this corner here if i went here and went prone how could they ever win how could they ever win uh george thank you for the five eric thank you for the fire man happy holidays to you too there's only six of them i feel this is unfair this map doesn't work very well where would where are the elves there's six of them now okay so they've got a couple more there oh we gotta go with george squad to the church everybody not in george squad get out of the church it's an old meme from a hell that loose video that but this guy's got the strat down oh let's stay there mr chaby look at this guy xmas isn't sway the rose skins mr chaby is this the player right here no you got to give him a chance you have to give them a chance give everyone a fair shake where are they where are my goddamn house stay back okay this one's gonna go clean out rudolph tonight if i get the kill that's it don't saw that rudolph stable i want you back no no no we lost one we lost a good man today [Music] who's next there's no way they're going to win this it's just not fair on this map is it it doesn't work very well matt elf's trying to be santa coming down the chimney they're playing this is where i excel though in the snow this is my climate i get perks santa moves 10 faster in the snow oh they took another it took another one four more kills taking them back to the north pole is that one up there that's my house dj they didn't stand a chance yeah that map is that's not the one for the game mode that should be taken out of the rotation elves won the first time you played this map sebastian really jimmy neutron thank you for the insight hey the fire what's up matt brown hey paul uh mark thank you for the 109 lurie santos cheers from brazil happy holidays glenn thank you for the 55 you really crack me up hope everything is all right merry christmas same to you man thank you all right this will be the last game of this i feel like you've got like maybe four or five rounds of this and then you know that's enough you get like uh do you get a card for this or something or a skin why would santa kill the elves when he could just fire them mr achilles they've fallen into eggnog which was poisonous and it's made them revolt there was a rebellion led by luke elf walker princess alpha as well she's wrapped up in it it's really messy you know i hope the uh i hope the owls can sort themselves out get it together just do what they do best you know making presents like how you could just all send it down there into the outer bounds area just die what was for dinner matt um it was cranberry onion and sausage burgers with potato wedges and then some salad on the side see they're doing the strat it's not the play you know that's that's too sweaty i'm afraid oh look at them all triple elf spied i don't have this not this sort of infestation on a thursday evening where'd you go i like to make many good noises when i fire this and pretend it's a minigun imagine if it was a christmas do you think that i ever put a minigun in this game i mean thinking about it right dlc for this game could be nuts because it's set in the year 2042 the kind of content they could add loads of like gadgets and futuristic weapons and stuff i mean i don't want anything too crazy i don't want lasers but you know final stand kind of vibe i think that would be cool whatever some mad ideas someone is burning through bullets there you have to take it to them this is santa that's the king of santa geddon we need to band together and destroy the elves there's seven of them but i mean i haven't seen a single one for about 10 years yes oh guys i just unlocked a grip oh my god wow an incredible sense of pride and accomplishment right there they're in my spot oh he just grappled me okay that did what like 10 damage i think it might be time to go hunting again you want to play a game do you want to play the game it's a squid game yes no okay right that's it time to hunt this was my mistake last time come with me lads we're going hunting for l's degrees yeah you want some you want something you want some don't you want some of this you want some of that run through a few bullets there come on surround me let's go it's around me come on bring it on this is my escape route right here that's an l squad leader right there big game big game you're smart dude you think you're smart you're clever do you bait me into this into a truck i'm stupid i raised you reloading hold on who's next that's just seagulls come on hit me hit me hit me off come on sugar ducky i know you want some of this sugar i know you want some of the sugar you want some this santa sugar don't you i know you're game i know how you feel i know how you feel remember what i did for you sacrificing everything well this one's going to get some special treatment you want some you want some of this you want some you want some of this yeah thought so north pole see you later easy win that is for santa easy win got nothing on us [Music] i'm just role-playing guys it's fine don't worry and there we go that's attack of the elves on battlefield 2042 portal christmas mode wow it's a bit of fun like three or four rounds you know i think playing it with a squad could be a good laugh i wonder what the highest amount of kills that santa could get would be hippo cheers for the 20 man love the positive content thank you [Music] more hell let loose sideways walrus i've got another hell let loose video coming up in a few days okay they've added 1942 versus 2042 conquest isn't hang on i'm gonna try this right isn't this gonna be ridiculously imbalanced look at this 1942 versus 2042. surely the guns and the tanks are just gonna cream everything see if anyone's playing it thank you robert what's up jacob fulton how you doing man thank you for coming to the stream you got a 12 900k yes dante special armor what have they buffed the 1942 soldiers what's going on here is it 64 players yes uh oh you get helicopters okay this doesn't seem fair at all it's gonna be interesting imagine if time travel was possible and you could actually go back from modern day to world war two with a tank a modern tank or a modern sniper rifle how crazy would that be when i was a kid i used to think about this kind of stuff some weird i used to think about like what if you could take a minigun or like a black hawk helicopter with a minigun back to roman times and just like pick a side and just demolish the opposition am i the only one did anyone else think about that kind of stuff or if you could go to like medieval times you know and they've got like bows and arrows and swords and shields and stuff trebuchets rock up with a grenade launcher same same okay so other people do think about this kind of stuff you think about it when you're 30 okay i mean i'm 35 and i you know i don't really think about that kind of stuff anymore but when i was a kid i used to it would be like hacking wouldn't it you would change history yeah you're essentially you'd be aimbotting kill me isn't that an anime there's an anime what's the anime called wait so somebody you telling me somebody stole my idea or hey i'm pretty sure i wrote down on a piece of paper when i was seven someone stole my idea okay cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool that's cool do you see how effective the rocket launcher is against these what vehicles what happens if you run out of ammo jack what you screw don't you you ruined i guess it's called gate is it good or is it just that concept is it actually good because if it's good i might watch it but if it's just that concept then you know i'll check out the reviews or whatever i can be a bomber this is stucker this is cool 1942 versus 2042 whoa did i just time travel then what it's pretty good okay it's terrible well there's that that's the internet right there personified one person said it's pretty good and literally the next comment was it's terrible so if i ever do time travel and someone asked me hey jack what's the internet i'll just turn that but they wouldn't ask me what the internet was because they they wouldn't know they wouldn't know would they they wouldn't ask me the question in the first place gate is really good wish i had a season two okay so it's only got one season as well that incentivizes me to watch it more bust out that lmg i don't think there is an lmg for 1942 um the allies get the bar that's not really it's not really an lmg though is it we'll do some sniping how about this world war ii sniper versus modern day what the hell just happened i don't want to get destroyed by the helicopter over and over again i think that's what's gonna happen though isn't it we need a rocket launcher i'm not sure i can snipe it i don't think i'd be able to penetrate it go this way time wars it's an interesting concept isn't it okay what the tank that was sick does this happen upstairs let's get destroyed by vehicles don't you in this game mode of the 1942 soldiers res i think they've changed it with logic they've figured out a way to do it in this game mode this is an official dice game mode though so they've probably got you know maybe they have things that we don't this is my calling now i'm the 1942 german soldier attempting to snipe the time travelers send them back to their own time the portal maps have stationary weapons uh yeah some of the classic ones do this one does oh my goodness how many times have i been killed by a vehicle guys is anyone counting is anyone is anyone counting about six maybe i want to say are we supposed to like do anything here it's going to hit him with the snipes yeah that guy just time traveled forward in time to the year 2042 and the first thing he heard when he came out of the time portal don't be sad sometimes it just turns out this way and he instantly time traveled back to 1942 couldn't take it this is the flank that we needed seven times five times 69 times i don't think it's 69 times can you level your guns if it's an official mode yeah i think official featured modes have full xp i don't think there's any cap on this game i have a question for you chap should i watch the league of legends thing on netflix because everything that i've seen about it says it's really good but i haven't played league of legends for about 50 years i did used to play a lot does it matter that i don't really play anymore and i haven't kept up with the lore of the game is arcane just a good show regardless of if you're a league of legends fan is it worth watching i'm off for a run okay most people are saying yes just quickly looking over yes watch it it's fun sure watch it it's worth it go outside save yourself interesting take i just still read the chat and i just got sniped in the head i don't play league and i enjoyed it a lot okay oh that's a cool animation i'm not seeing that before maybe maybe i should watch it then i think i was was i leaning too much then maybe it's got a window oh no it's blown out yeah guys look i'm reloading forever this car 98 can hold 50 000 bullets it's like the tardis it just keeps going it keeps on going i can't believe we actually pushed through this is good [Music] the bell tower's gone though hasn't it yeah it doesn't matter still up here you should definitely watch the witcher on netflix yeah i've seen that which was really good it feels like season one was like 10 years ago though doesn't it i like the witcher um my only issue with it was i didn't understand what the hell was going on until like the fourth episode when they go oh by the way guys everything that you just watched like we were it was like two was like seven different timelines um just thought we should let you know as soon as it's the third episode the different different timelines even though we didn't mention that once and didn't give you any context of that at all so just wanted you to know that that's why it was a bit confusing i think i would have preferred the first season of the witcher if it was just in a linear chronological fashion i think i would have enjoyed it more but maybe if you watch it second time it's better but yeah i think henry cavill's you know he plays a really good girl i mean some of the cgi was questionable i feel like they didn't have a big budget for the cgi in the first season like there's a dragon the you know looks like i made it in my university course or something when i was 22. uh but apart from that pretty good i think if you'd have read the books or played the games then you know you'd probably have a much better understanding of the series as it goes you should be like oh yeah that's bessemer and that's siri and that's the thing and there's the the horse there's roach and stuff that's one of the signs yeah i know what that is so maybe if i'd have um i mean i have played the games i haven't played them all the way through though but maybe if i'd had or you know read the books then i would have understood a bit more up until that third episode i think it was the third episode before thank you i don't want to get killed by a tank again nice i'm gonna get killed by a tank again aren't i yeah right behind me i'm not gonna look at it why are you why are you shining a laser at me what the hell what is that season two is out tomorrow yeah yeah i think i think that's right isn't it it is out tomorrow they probably didn't have a big budget for the first season i haven't played the games nor read the books i enjoyed it though i thought it was good uh matthew hicks happy birthday man i hope you had a good day thank you for coming along to the stream appreciate you being here 2042 snipers can do infinite reload me and my warzone car night has become a dmr that's cool is that a bug bug room is the fact that you can build the car 98 a semi auto a bug or is that is that a feature of the game with the attachments and everything because i saw a video of that and i was like there's no way that's real but apparently it is but is it a bug or is that just how it'd be i gave him my best shot chat excuse me stay in the future son why am i hitting there like i was hitting an invisible wall there you can get a full auto g43 metan you're kidding you're actually killing that's a joke isn't it you're joking please tell me that's not real am i irish no why are the reload animations in portals so stiff i don't i wouldn't say they're stiff i mean they're definitely different to the main game i think some of the original animations like in bf3 in particular were a bit better as well like the 1942 ones though definitely better than the original you know because that game's like 20 years old i think it's odd bet that they took a lot of the animations in the 1942 guns from battlefield v because why not right like you got a car 98 model this is probably the same model from the f5 with a different skin it looks similar use those animations that's okay with me like a tiger tank there this is our spawn isn't it we're just being destroyed in our spawn i wish my screen would stop shaking i was jack's game hasn't crashed yet um no no march say since i got my new pc i haven't really crushed at all to be honest i had a problem a couple days ago it was a dxgi error but apparently everyone gets that so i don't know this is fun man sniping sniping modern day soldiers with a car 98 helicopter please i think this might be better without the helicopters if it was just the planes i get a tiger tank oh what dice someone else got it this is no lock-on missiles is there in world war ii so it's difficult to take out the air vehicles it's just a a turkey shoot as they say what can i do [Music] yeah the dx error sucks randy sucks the big one do i ever swear i swear sometimes yeah i try not to swear on youtube though just so i can keep it you know pg-13 can't see us if we don't move yeah i've had a lot of um over the years like i've had a lot of parents email me saying oh you know thanks for keeping the language pg in your streams and videos because i can actually watch it with my kids or let's say their kids are young and they they're in their living room and they want to watch one of my videos they can put the tv on knowing that there's not going to be any like crazy swear words you know i used to swear a lot in my videos when i was younger youtube changed their rules though as well and it can affect your money uh coming in on like adsense it can affect uh your video being seen and promoted on youtube by the algorithm because of like the ad friendly guidelines you know like it has a big impact on everything really well that mode i think would be a lot better if i was playing as the 2042 soldiers and also if there were no helicopters well well well go and do it i dare you well well well no i'm not gonna do it while you're blowing people's heads off in war zone yeah i understand that there's a bit of a contradiction there but language is a different thing in my opinion have i said hecaroni matt you taught me the word hecaroni so yeah play some rush i think i think the distinction is like they can i mean i'm not i'm not a parent so i don't know anything about this really but i think the way i see it in my head is let's say like they learn they learn a swear word a kid learned a swear word they could then take that swear word to school and use it there use it in real life whereas let's say they're just watching of war zone gameplay or something or battlefield gameplay they can't really they can't really take that like it's it's language and like video games like there's a disassociation there that's the way i see it in my head anyway but one of them is like barely not real and one of them is used all the time i know everyone's gonna have different opinions on it aren't they up to you though i mean if you want to make your own content you can say whatever you want you know make it the way you want i have to remember that i'm not playing silly game mode anymore and i have to actually concentrate [Music] dice sorry [Music] thank you finally enemy is down not sure ac 42's to play for this i love that they've kept ports on him by their sorry rush in portal i really like rush mainly for the fact that it actually runs well i think i would have been better there using this and again put those defibs down call me oh i got revenge is that grenade in the land oh i just got a hit marker are you disappointed by the very apparent lack of sally tater in this battlefield james did they not say sanitator in the 1942 stuff look at that guy legend here for the rest time to tater beater time to reload a sniper what do i think about faction based specialists i think they should do it honestly i think it would be better for the game if they did it do i think they'll do it no just go single fire i need ammo guys look at this scarf i need to use the gl as well everyone says that the gel is actually quite good best gun to farm in battlefield at the moment pkp i'd say to me can you shoot nades in midair like battlefield 5 i don't think so jack wallace no don't think you can i'm pretty sure i've tested that how would faction based specialists work i told you to keep up i think if they were going to do it they'd need sorry 20 to start with because 10 isn't enough because there's only five per side then so let's say they had 20 specialists in total you put 10 of them on the u.s side and you put 10 of them on the russia side and then you could have two specialists in a class category that had access to certain gadgets but only if they're in that category can they get those gadgets maybe they can pick any gun but gadgets i don't know and maybe if it's a an engineer class they get a repair tool by default if it's a medic class they get defibs and fast provide by default but they need they need double the amount of specialists for it to be fun i think at the moment anyway because one of the main design choices with this game is freedom of choice apart from the unique gadget of the specialist you can pick anything that you want and they've designed it that way so and that causes a problem if you start separating the specialists into different factions because let's say that you love playing a sundance you join a server but you're on the russian team you can't play sundance so it makes a lot of problems like the design it's going to get all higgly piggledy so you know i think maybe there is a solution to it but i don't know the answer i think it's a difficult problem uh pack thank you for becoming a member man that's very kind you appreciate that releasing cable i thought there was a guy here he's right there i've got the kill there i didn't get any hit markers oh where'd you come from maria come help on uh the wolf thank you for becoming a member it's very kind here legend you're gonna diffuse this [Applause] jump they got b no i don't way see that guy renee we have a man down is there a way to cancel revives guys ifap lord thank you for becoming a member once you've started the revive can you cancel it somehow i was stuck in it there is there an option how many fps on new pc oh there you go i just like changed my capture card for a second there that was interesting 160. [Applause] everything's on low apart from texture detail on medium 170. [Music] come on dude pat thank you for becoming a member i wasn't even shooting there's a toggle option does the toggle option let you cancel it then dude this mp9 is ridiculous i love it so good i need ammo yeah i haven't overclocked my gpu either it's just the default settings at the moment uh it's the asus 3090 strix so there's a bit of overclocking headroom on it i haven't haven't touched it yet eight bullets i'm being a pain in the ass here gonna die though i have any ammo you would just let go of the button okay cool so i can change that then derek cheers for coming remember loads of new members today guys um if you become a member you get access to the discord of course you get the emojis for chat and the chat badge uh if you're a new member go to jackfrags.com discord and there's instructions on there how to join if you want to completely optional of course you don't have to that's a nice little kill streak there get to that position oh david yeah they could do that but then is that really is that really making factions maybe so you you're suggesting like so the russians have a version of sundance but with a different name right and they look different that's what you're suggesting right that could work totally see you later eric thank you for coming where's the only fans jack barry i'm not i'm not gonna maybe one day you know if things uh don't work out for me can you grapple smoke grenades i think so brian yeah can you still do it i don't know did they patch that yet let's test so if i put a smoke grenade [Music] yeah you can still grapple them that's so stupid one cool feature though which i can show you do this you can do that and try and do like sick montage clips or whatever you want fly into the air oh come on why is there someone up there that was my spot bro at smith cheers for the five you play the portal infected mode again or host it is that is that the official one i didn't think they'd given the code away for it angel does it again come on angel oh my god there's so many enemies there ten two cheers for the five any fun plants for christmas just seeing family eating good food that's it that's what christmas is about for me there's a big wave of um povid as well in the uk at the moment so you know not really the time to be um socializing too much let's say i'm pretty uh reserved anyway like i don't really do much for christmas i like the food in the family and looking at the pretty lights oh my game froze i'll be back that's weird wasn't it perfect destruction for you there's so many head glitches on this map around here can they actually get this i don't know they've only got 16 ticks good try oh hello i mean it is nuts isn't it this gun maybe it's a bit too good is the mp9 better than the k30 i i want to say yeah i think it is oh yeah shotgun horrible good defense enjoyed that martin is it really that bad on the original xbox one i've not had any experience with it on xbox one or ps4 original does it really run bad a good day's work but i'm not one to brag [Music] mafo thanks for coming to member maybe i should try it do i have an original xbox one i think i do i think i've got it in the loft somewhere maybe i should get out and do a video on it yeah tommy judd do you think that the way aaa games are being released at the present time is due to everything that has happened in the last two years or something else um i think it's a combination of things i think covid has definitely hurt a lot you know the developers having to adjust to working from home scenarios constant zoom calls i know that qa has been really difficult as well in so it's definitely had an effect but i don't think that excuses uh pushing a game out too early before it's ready you know i think that the publishers and developers should be more frank with how the games are in the state of them and maybe have them as a beta first rather than hey you can buy this now like i think this game for example obviously it wasn't ready when it launched there was too many bugs way too many bugs um you know a couple of features missing as well [Applause] maybe if they'd have released this as a free-to-play beta first and then go on look you know we we haven't had time to get everything where we want it to be but help us play test the game and then eventually you can pay for it it's not going to be in baser anymore you know maybe that would have been better but like it happened a little bit with vanguard as well like vanguard had a lot of uh like bugs when it came out but some of them were game breaking um what else there was another game that came out recently that launched when it was you know quite rough was it another fps i can't remember what it was but there's been like three major releases like halo infinite as well like i love the fact that their multiplayer is free to play um but the paid portion of the game is just the campaign like there's no co-op like halo launching without co-op to me that's really sad because in the past i've always played the campaigns like uh two three four i think even five i played that three by myself but i also played in code with my mates and uh it was really fun so it's a shame that infinite launch without that feature cyberpunk is also another you know good example 2077 was flawless apparently it's pretty good now apparently they've actually patched it quite a lot because the steams the steam reviews have flipped to mostly positive but i've not i've not tried it out pop comes in may i'm actually attacking now i get really bored of defending i that's why i left that server it just turns me off attack is way more fun watch my back are the war stories good in 2042 it doesn't have a single player true gamer doesn't have a single-player campaign i wanted to go to the next level oh my god i hate aiming down worse thing about using a mouse i gotta get me some ammo does anyone have ammo give it thank you pbx is also pretty good man like the smg's are so strong in this game uh mecca hey jack use your creator code on final fantasy 7 on pc luckily there's a 10 coupon for the game yeah um so that on the epic game store that's every time you like buy something that's over 14.99 you get a ten dollar coupon so you can keep doing that as many times as you want on a 57 release today didn't it remake right he's actually like apart from him and iris i don't really like many of the other characters in the game you play angel just for the free ammo poke yeah angel's like even though he's really annoying his abilities are actually really good like i think he's one of the best characters in the game in terms of gameplay because when you drop that armor plate you get armor and you get ammo so you can if you take a med pack as well you've got armor ammo and health whenever you want and you can also change the loadout which will replenish all of your ammo instantaneously so yeah he's he's like one of the best specialists in the game kicking triple right there boys i'll take that one to the back thank you thank you that's a really really bad spawn spawn beacon [Applause] i've not unlocked the uh the thing for that shotgun give me that give me that yeah i need to get the book shot for this so that one hit kill distance there because they've got this like it's called triplo bookshot or something it's the last attachment that you get i think they've got it is that it oh it's the number one bug shot yeah but the one hit kill distance on this is nuts i'm not even unlock this skin yet either you still get it i don't know grenade outgoing ah trying to get back there is a knock off of the mode already in portal they got the the masks deep here have they managed to get the masks in as well or they just done a knockoff of it bit jurassic park this isn't it yeah you can grapple grenades a lot of people don't know that yet apparently i thought it was common knowledge but let's say like there's a guy [Applause] i was about to demonstrate do it again yeah i was gonna do it again but i just got killed i'm not gonna last i've got a jammy dodger someone asked what i was eating jeremy dodger and a cup of tea do you guys know what a jammy dodger is hey jason um so if i like i do this there's a guy there look for him see that guy was low i killed him got the assist i've got you hold on don't worry i'll revive you let's go casper new to the prunes we've got to take them out is there someone defending this no nobody defending it okay might be on the roof i have to pay respects but do it now if i had another grenade but i don't reloading now rhyming slime i am not overconfident you've never heard that phrase before enjoy this moment when someone gets lucky do you call them a jammy little dodger you could you're a jeremy dodger you are mate you could do that yeah that works a jammy dodger is a i want to say shortbread biscuit two black discs in between is raspberry or strawberry jam and then in the middle of the top one is a heart you can dunk them if you dunk them in a tea it melts the jam a little bit and it goes all gooey and lovely spotted dick yeah that's also a thing spotted dick is a dessert in the uk quite tasty as well jack frags and broken machine are never online at the same time we're the same person dave um i'm broken machine but i just use a voice changer you never know amir thank you for becoming a member i love your profile picture link doctor who taught you about the jammy dodger is that right watermelon what's up mink how you doing up knobs yeah hobnobs are all so good we got all sorts of biscuits in the uk man this uk biscuits are popping off can biscuits pop off i don't know i'm defending again oh whatever i want to attack on this map it looks fun [Music] we're going to appear simon where's the talk at though what the hell are these physics time there's a man here good job simon simon we gotta go to b now we're going backwards to b okay simon simon there's an mav there i'm sorry i've ruined us even us go away pig just killed myself what's that really good chocolate from england cadbury cadbury's the most popular chocolate in the uk summon yeah cadbury has got a lot of legacy and history in the uk they also have a big factory called cadbury's world oh my god dude why is that shotgun please yeah cadbury's world is is cool you can just go and like they have just a massive chocolate factory you can walk around and see how it's all made oh a shotgun though what the hell how is that one hit killing me from there that doesn't seem right i've never seen that before like that distance is nuts usually you don't get killed back not far away in one shot with that shotgun yeah uk chocolate's very different to us chocolate why are there no sundances just throwing grenades at that how is it still firing it's dead it's still firing that was weird i need some meds you got meds no i want the deuce i want to get over there he put a turret over there what if i steal that car down there there we go [Music] [Laughter] someone jumped in it i wanted to switch to the second seat study is an insane sniper yeah he's really good lewis yeah i think he's one of the best yeah us chocolate and uk chocolate are very different if you ever visit one of the other countries try it out and you'll be like okay well i wasn't expecting that i think uk and i know this is going to sound biased but i think uk chocolate is a lot better than us chocolate you know being being as um subjective as possible i honestly prefer uk chocolate a lot more it's just sweeter it just has a bit more of a milky taste to it i can't remind you oh there we go what about canadian chocolate i've never tried it best chocolate is swiss chocolate if you guys ever get a chance to go to switzerland buy some chocolate trust me you won't be disappointed bumps in oh come on that should have been a hit why was that not a hit this is why i don't like defending end up with situations like this you must be thinking hershey's versus cadburys no i've tried i've tried lots of chocolate in the u.s i promise again it's not you know there's nothing wrong with that i mean lots of people will prefer uk chocolate it's okay man if you like us chocolate better that's fine it's not like a it's not a patriotic thing for me i'm not a very patriotic person i just think it tastes better that's all there's a turret right there isn't it all right what was the game mode like pezza it was it was quite fun for like three or four matches i wouldn't play any more than that though [Music] bro please come on hit me with the mouth i've started a war i didn't mean to start a war i'm sorry you just started a war you don't know what you've done that was a good guess i'll tell you what though one of the best things about getting my new pc and actually getting good frames is sniping is so much so much fun now so much easier like i know i'm going to sound like a pc elitist here but sniping on a mouse which is already kind of broken input for the game and is like you know 70 to 90 fps it just felt horrible it felt awful but now i've got like 150 160 frames like it actually feels good and i can you know be consistent with my sniping again quite easy to snipe in this game as well they massacred the cream eggs or cream eggs holder one is really good i like tobra yes what does that mean in russian that's it i'm ready for a run too [Music] enjoy these moments when they come i've just do set up rich exclamation mark setup go i got it from pc specialist what's my least favorite specialist rau rau is is pretty much useless needs a complete overhaul you get 12 fps on your series x chad oh you're looking at like golden eye nintendo 64 level there buddy maybe living the dream it means have strength thank you sir there is power it means russian chocolate is the best well well well our crunchy chocolate bars are really good oh guys i'm defending again makes me sad try and get some nice snipes for you i'll become the new study i could never they started would hit both those shots i'm sorry dice you see the blood then actual blood then ruined do i still use 1600 dpi yes alex the higher dpi less input latency you have so put your dpi up put your in-game sense down just whatever you're comfortable with you know come on sundance throw your grenades let's go don't care killed the mav rocket sniper gta okay i'll try and do one um i could actually use the sniper as well couldn't i come to think of it if i get a head shot it could work the thing is when you guys say this kind of stuff in chat i just start messing around and i don't play the game and then people are why aren't you playing the game jack you know like but you know a challenge is a challenge let's have a look go on the roof there 90 meters from my position never works first time let's get going and that happens as well sometimes you can't pop the shoe quick enough anders you use 3200 dpi with a very low in-game sense been rocking it for years good for you man you were ahead of the curve it seems i need help here please oh there is a free game as well today yeah that's a good point on the epic game store there's three games up to december the 6th i think one every day and it's shenmue 3 today i've never played that game though so i don't know if it's any good i could do it from here and then i think i'd have time to need a target there's loads of targets here okay dude you see i start messing around this happens you guys coerce me into this revive me yes so we we hit but we didn't get a head shot i'm gonna need ammo now as one well i got you i need to get the headshot what did you say casper what did you say to me you flew too close to the sun i'll try and get one and then i'll uh i'll play properly after that do it again you won't you see you're egging me on again i'm too easily coerced this is the spot though isn't it whoever's put this bomb beacon up let's have a look um maybe that guy there enemy fire team res let's go okay i'm literally behind you dying on the floor okay no simon thank you is that guy still there stop it he's moved now damn it i just need a nice stationary target you know okay this is it this is the one missed so i'm out of smoke grenades now you grapple onto enemies if you grapple an enemy it does a little bit of damage and that's it you can't like blink yourself towards them if that's what you mean is that what you mean he's gone underneath me they're so rude shooting at me iron dog they're just trying to play the game but i can't complain i'm trying to do stupid stuff grapple some smoke that's what i'm doing in it i mean i'm trying to i'm trying to grapple the smoke while it's in the air it's a trick it's a trick shot guys a trick shot what is that take it down oh please just let me be me you know i just want to fly all i want come on simon yes legend [Applause] where are they [Applause] i'm gonna go over here away from everyone i'm too far though i'll miss the shot marker move to that area no headshot this it's killing time boris this is where like playing angel would be good i'm gonna get the grapple hook then sir you're good okay i'll have a free kill you how did that not no way [Applause] disgraceful baby oh you can see me okay can you still throw back grenades in this game aka yeah you can not all of them though if you could grapple enemies you would be scorpio like get over here like mortal kombat style yeah somebody help me damn it i don't know if that would be i mean it'd be fun for the person doing the grappling imagine if you could grapple someone and then do like a um a drop kick to the chest or something stupid like that how done would that be that'd be so good really annoying though i imagine i tried using the ac 42 in single fire mode no i haven't i could see it being good though [Applause] did you deserve a trade kill there i don't think you did [Applause] come on come on [Laughter] went for the donald duck no scope is that what you call it annual leopard the donald duck no scope first time i've heard that phrase need a second to reload interesting way of putting it to be honest the donald duck what makes it donald duck what makes a noscope donald duck when you make the noise like i did that once in a game mode a couple weeks ago that's a call back isn't it i appreciate your memory good memory did you successful defense i mean the sws is single fire archie all the time come on this is too easy that's it i'm ready for a run too see like yes cadbury's marvelous creations with jelly popping candy ryan that's the stuff right there man that stuff is incredible very addictive though very addictive it's got like jelly candy in it and it's got cracking what's that stuff called that you get in the little packet you put it in your mouth and it like crackles pop rocks it's got pop rocks kind of thing in it yeah the the recoilless is very slow cdr compared to the old-school small has anyone seen any cheaters yet i have a billy i mean i think to the game's credit like i don't think i've come across any cheats offending again nice well at least i can goof around and try and do my stupid thing i'll do as soon as i do it once that's it i'm done and then you can um stop being annoyed with me oh my god the entire team's up here what the hell rice krispies no not as crispy kevin meth different thing babylon some people call it popping candy in the uk it's called pop rocks oh angel angel does it again there's no way yeah i'm stuck there's no way you can mess though angel does it again doesn't do it again because he's he's stuck all right i got this do this oh [Music] come on pain an enemy with the self-destruction from the dog speckles that's actually a really interesting thing that you can do not many people know about that i've been working on a video behind the scenes where i just show some of the weird stuff you can do in the game because there's a lot of like interesting things you could do in this game with combinations of gadgets and specialists and people just don't know about it i think it will be quite an interesting video sometimes just doing laps up here that's an assist okay yeah kevin you can grapple a grenade yeah i wanna if i had a dollar for every time someone asked that i'd have 69 i just want to get one one kill while i'm doing it that's it don't care if i die on the way down i just want to get one kill that's annoying you'd have been able to grapple that in bf5 i think okay 330 degrees around 50 meters from my position i don't know why it never works first times okay bro you've been playing casper and making ammo drones on breakthrough and flying them around spawn resupply that's probably a really good way to get xp isn't it can you yeah can you grapple a grenade yeah did you know the 93r was burst did you guys know did you know that jack did you guys know that it's always just a hit isn't it never a kill yes yes okay i'm done i've done it achievement unlocked okay please oh you please they turn their back to you like that it's really hard to snipe them razor death out of moves now man this is a d pro super light trust me way forward it's like something out of a just cause game yeah kind of 270 degrees 110 meters away boris horizimo hmm i always i never quite get enough damage to kill it got one the hell what was going on there the shotgun off or something they got three tickets guys one more for the road let's go nice please [Music] guys did you know that you can grapple grenades [Music] a good day's work but i'm not one to brag [Music] are you really surprised oh maria's looking a bit sus there [Music] where's the ntw [Music] on the sniper class [Music] what's my favorite game of 2021 what is my favorite game of 2021 let me just look at a list i don't usually pick favorites i think the most complete game that i've played from start to finish that didn't really have any bugs and just kept me entertained the whole time was resident evil village honestly i thought it was fun interesting characters fun gameplay i mean there's some other ones that i enjoyed but i wouldn't say they were my favorites it's not been a good year for games next year will be a lot better i think i reckon there'll be some actual next-gen titles next year all i want is jedi fall in order to that's all i care about give me the star wars i haven't finished guardians of the galaxy but that was very good that game really surprised me [Applause] ow oh there we go one shot i've not played return on paradise now i really enjoyed elden ring but that's not out that's out next year so i don't think i could say that i played the closed network test [Music] i didn't get a chance to play forza i wish i did because everyone said that was amazing i have seen the trailer for star wars eclipse yeah can't get up there yet it's so dark here just shading give me some ammo this doesn't work oh come on that was a nice flick to be fair he was shooting at someone on the ground and then flicked up to me you can play it on game pass yeah i just haven't had a chance dude i i'm just too busy i haven't had a chance to play it when it came out as well all my friends were playing it i think that kind of game is just better when you play with friends you know but yeah you're

responsibility all of them char archie i think no i was arming the objective i would like to continue arming the objective and not reviving my teammate please [Music] we want you on bf1 tommy i did talk about this in a comment recently so um i'm gonna reinstall the majority of the old battlefield games so bf5134 and i'm going to start cycling that content into my regular schedule as well because i don't think like i don't think battlefield 2042 is gonna get an update until march so there won't be much new stuff you know apart from outside of what's made in portal and events if they do any like weekly game modes i think it would be fun to you know put some of that old stuff in there regular rotation like i've got a really good round on bf5 a couple days ago why can't i not shoot through that reloading grapple fire go down didn't expect me up there did you buster what the hell was that i landed and i couldn't move for like a second i'm running behind us as well yeah i'm gonna have to attack this differently i think clear out the right side smoke it smoke it push up on the m-com hold it don't let me die over here okay i'm sorry it's over for you a sweet storm thank you for the five long time sub first donut keep up the good content thank you man uh cyclonus cheers for the five lovely work was playing bf5 today i feel the gameplay so much better than the the sync on 2042 drives me crazy it doesn't work what do you mean do you mean v-sync or just generally speaking we only got seven tickets [Music] five tickets [Music] come on this is too easy i am not over confident i'm just better than everyone else a good day's work but i'm not want to brag a good day's work i wish people were better at reviving teammates that are done don't we all uptick don't we all what headset sean i use a sennheiser 363d headset did they change the textures on the m5 no but i'm using a skin on it adolf he thought the fire truck was in the game it's outside my house yeah i don't think there's a fire truck in the game hey sean what's up what monitor hp omen x27 i think they've got ready the well we're well quick beam i've not heard it in a while and it was a terrible voice line so it doesn't surprise me go to bed jack you go to bed lewis it's only midnight that in maybe i'll go to bed in an hour how about that deal go away pokeball i don't think putting it on the objective was the best call there i don't know maybe not why are you there it's just a snake in the middle of the desert pain absolute pain as long as i brush my teeth who doesn't brush their teeth before bed you brush your teeth in the morning after you've had breakfast and tea or coffee and then you brush them before you go to bed if you don't do that you should i think they put that they've actually put the mav like in a spot where we can't get to the emcon from the side we need to get to the mcom which is quite frustrating let's try it over go wait please that's the worst placement of an m-com sorry of an mav i've ever seen i'd actually screwed us actually screwed us so hard you do it about once a week oh my god brush your teeth once a week do you not get like that weird film on your teeth and it just feels icky good i can't stand not having like brushed teeth but it drives me crazy if i have like a coke or a tea or a coffee or something it just feels horrible one shot cool thank you cyclonus you're trying to break the work the world record for not brushing your teeth larry is that a good is that a good world record to have i don't know if that's a good world record to happen i didn't brush my teeth for a year and now they've all fallen out but you know i got the world record so that's all i care about that's dedication right there come on there's a stupid movie here i'm gonna go nuts [Music] instantly disarm them what the hell happened then no max not not after every beverage dude just you know when the time's right i'd love i'd love teammates to actually play the objective i would love that i feel like i'm the only person in the world right now actually trying to arm the m-com that's how i feel and my teammates are constantly 47 meters precisely away from me doesn't matter what map i want they're always 47 me 47 meters yep i'll be there next to you on the m-com nah no way mate no chance my god someone actually went to army i'm so proud of you son there's a guy above me i see the shadow uh [Music] okay that's a one shot kill cool cool cool why is that a one-shot kill you can't mate with that it's a different species it's a different species oh my god what the hell just landed in front of me and stop me killing those people what was that was that a loadout crate what is happening it was a loadout great oh my god oh i'm not enjoying this map so far let me tell you let me tell you thank you for the 10 toast it's just burnt bread well yeah it is that's exactly what it is you're not incorrect i swear to god if i got killed then i did just all their food [Music] straight up i just would have bought i don't think this map works for rush i'm gonna put it out there i'm not feeling it you know toast is dry bread no it's not it's not dried bread how is it dried bread you're not drying it out when you toast it you're burning it aren't you [Music] okay i'm gonna switch to sundance i think that's the play which is the sundance born on the roof was born on the roof born on the roof we spawn on the roof that's not the roof need you alive can we go onto the roof fig thank you for the tent any new specialist ideas i think it's really difficult to come up with them honestly i don't envy whoever's in charge of that dice because like some of them are just bad i feel like they've already done all the tropes there are enemies up there there are different levels of toast yeah but ultimately you're just burning it aren't you always burning the brick it doesn't matter what level of toast you've created you're still burning it drying it out have i put you guys in the mood for some toast by the way do you want toast now you should go get some toast [Music] why do you have to hold to close the doors [Music] one down [Music] is down and you subconsciously smell toast right now just take a little sniff just sniff in can you smell hot buttered toast you just woke up in the morning come on this is too easy you had an early dinner the night before 6 p.m didn't eat anything after that just woken up what's the smell hot buttered toast there it is [Music] why is sundance always screaming i don't know they just love to scream can't help themselves scream everything they wake up in the morning they're going downstairs put the kettle on go to the office move reception into the elevator as they walk through their office section good morning deborah just the way they are you know england okay right now i know that i'm attacking we can win this okay get out and plant the bomb okay get out and plant the bomb okay get out and plant the bomb okay get out and plant the bomb okay get out and plant the bomb oh my god i mean that's it's done for the tanks no stop that stop that angel bang yes sorry bro you couldn't do it in time another one that's it mckay you show him who's boss you trying with the real jake general is i throw that there i'm gonna explode i'm gonna go like that i'm gonna raise this guy one of those grenades is gonna get a kill they're throwing a grenade back at me it's pain it's playing life is pain all right maria felt throws down some meds for me so i can pick this corner and not die she shoots me with a medic gun right away i called it but i was shot through the smoke i mean nice what's going on okay right they are really hold up here and the smoke we're gonna push forward you can see me through smoke again is there like a bug in the game where you can see through smoke or something that i don't know about what's going on what is a crumpet kevin oh kevin just google crumpit let's have a google what's up and you'll want one instantly michael stevens thank you for the five hey jack did you know that you can grapple onto grenades and get sick trick shots michael i didn't know that i'll have to try that out uh optic faith thank you for becoming a member if i played cruelty squad i don't know what that is wait okay boris boris turret spots through smoke is that what you're telling me i did not know that that explains a lot oh stupid armor dude just get rid of the armor please dice just get rid of it it doesn't belong in the game i hate it i hate it i hate it i think what's happening is as i'm running through the smoke the turret is spotting me i'm gonna go down a level and that's how you play the objective [Music] oh my god maybe i think we've got friendlies on the point on come on come on come on come on come on bang oh looks like they worked on the ghost bullet issue it doesn't happen to me anymore some guy i think they fixed it i've seen a couple clips of it with tanks though where using the secondary weapon you can put bullets into people and they don't take damage i've seen that but i've not really seen it much recently with just normal guns so yeah i do think they fixed that whatever that bug was which is good i just hit that falcon and the health bar stayed the same we've got some good medics on the team here this is nice makes a change boris just put up another turret is that a walk what did you say 200 meters move to the left rush is really good man i i really enjoy this i could play this for a while i just wish there was more maps it would be good if this official rotation also included the classic maps as well though so you could do the whole 13. you know oh my god it just hit the dozer in front of me what do you put on your crumpets i just put butter on first butter another word for a crump bit is a pie clip that's correct killer styles i think that's an older generation thing though my mom used to call them that and i show my sensitivity yeah so 1600 dpi four quite low this is a roof here isn't it so like this is like a 360 for me like it's almost like two two and a little bit sometimes two if i go fast no jam you can't have jam on it i prefer i prefer savory crumpet though to be fair like sweet crumpets are okay i prefer a savory where do they spawn here so [Music] does this end up going to the stadium i don't think i've got past this bit yet on this level see ty's life i've heard them called the same thing but maybe a pikelet is like a different version as well um jeez fat pancakes no they're slightly different they're more bready than a pancake [Music] is there some changes with the system just press subscribe if you're not subscribed i don't think there's been any changes now make sure you subscribe and then um turn notifications on if you want to see all of my uploads if you don't want to see all my uploads then just press subscribe good shot if they put bf4 in paul i'll be happier i think like an injection of bf4 maps to be wicked for paul yeah why not [Music] you wish we could have smgs as side weapons oh death they'd have to be nerfed big time if they were side weapons i know there's a guy behind me there but i'm just going to keep going forward i'm dead now because of that the rest thank you they're back dead help me come back with honey's good andrea all we've done is talk about food this stream guys i'm here for it though you know i don't mind that's that's okay uh real joel james thank you for becoming a member appreciate that thank you [Music] oh my god might

for it then all the way back here i'm nearby what is that what was that is that a player why are you there not having the best of luck here sonny thank you for the 20. veggie white or marmite can't stand either of them sonny disgusting sorry cash thank you for the 10. can you speak in your arnold voice for three minutes i think i'll destroy my throat dude look at that snake slippery snake i think one of our vehicles what the hell i really want to see the next section though i don't know i'm gonna do it 10 tickets oh they have a tank as well no wonder zero 200 meters away yeah there's no way on a million years snake meat is nice really people eat snakes i suppose they wouldn't they probably just tastes like chicken though in it everything just tastes like chicken anyone not from england never had yorkshire pudding if you haven't learned to make them and try them later angel please delete yourself i mean i am as shocked as you still got it rattlesnake's pretty good [Music] very good tommy okay interesting in arizona it's a delicacy loving the gun game jack thank you sam i don't think gun games here anymore though it's gone we'll finish up with some um judy breakthrough yeah we'll do breakthrough 128 players i've not played 128 for a while so it'd be interesting orbital you can pop off with a sniper maybe ending oh yeah vehicles remember those let's talk if i get dunked on by vehicles again again i'm just gonna go play 64. i think i'm aiming a bit too high i can immediately feel my fps truck [Applause] [Applause] perfectly covered behind the tree there did that right too low too low again eat my grenade i think i need to get a bit closer don't know guys let's be honest hit the high ground why across there is awful usually eight times this is not the eight times it's the six times i thought they changed the eight times i thought it looks the same as this maybe you're right maybe i should change sniper camp yes indeed i'm defending aren't i yeah i think i'm defending let's see i don't know the choke points i don't play breakthrough enough really to know i've played breakaway which was quite fun i enjoyed that on 128 i have played this before i remember from the target i think there's one on the top behind me apple peaceful good name what's my favorite american food i can get in britain too brought a question i'm afraid you're james there's so many american foods in the uk why did you he troll him [Music] maybe maybe they did are there no snipers like right at the back there's none around the rocks or anything you're dead i forgot to put it eight times on you're a fool oh we're dead are there hot dogs in the uk yeah they're a rare delicacy though man i'm just kidding no you could easily get hot he gone little bird sorry where are the enemies i mean that's a big bad it should be inventory pushing me but they're not throwing the special everything you need to shout some more the deuce ansible i just realized it's an lav in this game um it's called the wildcat nicholas oliver if that's what you mean that's the most lav type vehicle i would say in the game they have nerfed the little bird right a little bit louie yeah a little bit just a little bit look at all these guys here what the hell there's a tornado on the way right about on my own here whatever i'm doing it for the memes there's a tornado somewhere [Music] but where don't shoot buddy just wait i need to get closer when is console getting a scoreboard console has that scoreboard already but i mean it's not really the same that's what you mean is it trying to pkp first really really wish out the pkp then i would have just pushed to that building if my teammate's still there i can spawn on them maybe they still oh no we got the point back there nope they're still there good okay pkp don't be in combat don't be in combat don't be in combat please don't be in combat i've been in combat stop being dead it's not as good as it 128 player i think 64 just feels better just feels a bit more readable a bit more predictable you know [Music] don't get dumped on by vehicles as much either makes a nice change 210 degrees 200 meters yeah there's a helicopter slowing me down do i ever play the console version of bf or just pc just just pc really let's go i have tried the console version though but i'm not very good on controller so [Music] if i avoid it nandos are the best nando's is good i like hernandos okay let's see we can put this pkp to work what's the build have i unlocked everything that's called compensator i'll do this one has a built-in bipod doesn't it what does it no difference there i press x i thought x was the button for it it was last time i played see you later [Music] it jumps out there right oh that attack helicopter looks sick i just get so bored defending man controlling this game is weird yeah i've heard that from a lot of people apparently the controller just doesn't feel very good in this game whether that's the aim assist or the acceleration on the sticks i don't know damn jack we're all the easter eggs well we don't we haven't really seen any yet to be honest there's a few little ones nothing major though this gun is nuts leave me alone there maybe i'm trying to do my thing bro favorite weapon on the game um probably the ak i haven't used it at all tonight though but like it's just a good good all-round assault rifle really don't steal my kill that's my kill come on bro come on huh i'm being bumped around i actually got a2 as well interesting need to get up there clear it polar or pepsi cola blob every time every single time pepsi's fine but i would never order overcoat pepsi is too sweet at least it is in the uk [Music] okay can i make it up here i don't know but i'm going to try knows the answer dr pepper dr pepper's completely different class though isn't it it's coke and pepsi completely different different ball game you know the good thing i love about the us is you can get dr pepper on tap can't really get that in the uk permanently in combat this guy over here you doing over there mccabe be good here wouldn't it so we can just like grapple up there give it a go hopefully i don't get spotted here we go i know you there you tried to introduce brits to root beer root b is not bad through a pickle i don't mind it it's okay we actually lost the sector there wow
