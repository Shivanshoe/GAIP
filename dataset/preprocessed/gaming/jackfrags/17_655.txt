hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty war zone today we are going to be using the car 98 I posted a video a couple days ago where I was using this bad boy I really enjoyed it and since then I've leveled it up I've got all the attachments for it and I've put together this build which I think will be competitive war zone so that's what we'll be using today I'm playing with Vic Starr and study so it should be a really good team nice little squad that we've got today and I'm expecting some full-on sweaty tryhard lobbies so it's gonna be good also I have to say a big thanks to Nvidia and PC specialists for sponsoring this content today this is part of the frame's win games campaign that they've got going on at the moment and it asks the question if you've got more framerate our games easier I suppose so a big thanks to them for sponsoring and they put together this video which is recorded on a PI frames per second camera 1000 fps and you can see the difference here between 240 FPS 144 and 60 and what they're doing here is just highlighting the smoothness of the game when you've got a higher frame rate 144 is pretty good I mean I play on a 240 Hertz monitor and it's really easy to see the difference when you slow it down so much like this and you've got someone jumping here as well you can see there's quite an obvious this like difference between 60 and 240 really interesting they've collaborated with a few different people to investigate this I mean I've always tried to get as much FPS as I possibly could but this video is a nice little demonstration of that I suppose but we are playing on art 2080 I today I've got the frame rate up in the top left-hand corner as well and we'll be doing five of these streams one a week every Thursday will be live at the same time playing with study and big star it's quite an obvious difference there you also get lower latency as well if you have higher frames lower input lag I suppose there's a guy called battle nonsense you did a really interesting video on this kind of fun stuff it's cool well yeah big thanks to Nvidia once again for sponsoring this one and also PC specialist err a customs system builder in the UK I don't know if they serve Europe in the u.s. maybe they do but they're also sponsoring the content today and it's a great place if you want to pick up a system build your own PC whatever you want to do with that said I'm going to see if the boys are ready and there's a link in the description below if you want to check these guys out so let's get into the game so let's try that car 98 see if we can take some names to them really looking forward to this all right you boys ready they must still be muted let's see if I can join their party oh all right Vic how you doing good good thanks yeah yeah not bad you ready for the sweat I'm totally ready season four has been an absolute madness something wild some I'm hearing one of the chamber just trying to warm up the shop but what one in the Chamber's out now is it I didn't really this is a good little good little aim warmup okay a study said okay no he's still mewed he's off mate I don't know where he's gone he's no he's not comfortably just yeah okay can we get a lot built yeah I'm in this one gym but as soon as study comes out back out I'll probably be dead by then no problem I mean I'm on my last life you have lives in that three lives yeah just like so it's been in multiplayer three lives and then one in the chamber all right I actually tried it yes this is like it's a fun little time kill because like sometimes I'll be like waiting for you Balthus Quelf no getting gum fight yeah halfway in the game I'm super messy where these like it's like a 4-minute game right that's on standard multiplayer is it yes wanting the chamber let's see what's up Zachary how you doing hello Jo will I'm really in the same right here shifty so Jennifer hey Ally welcome to the stream guys all right 1v1 situation team pro I'm gonna be using the growl as my secondary today on the sniper boy I know I've got the mp5 could use the vector yeah we'll see yeah I've not played one in the chamber on modern warfare I'm sure that I tried it back in the day home life is that all right so I miss straight away I missed again yes I got the double ooh cheeky soul again is it like the first to a number of points or something it's literally a Last Man Standing but like you can die out early and still win right it's like you get points per each kill okay oh dude this is fun I'm enjoying this all of a sudden war things been put on the bench screw war zone let's just play this all right should we get a lobby going I'm ready that's good fun that is I'm ready to join study on this on this night the front sniping today I am indeed actually as well if we have three men on this night it could actually be kind of lethal because we like to be able to finish kills hopefully before they get self raised by the Worland mmm what are you taking with this night I'm 15 is the way such as such versatile yarn it's the only gun I think you can run with a sniper I realistically not the RAM 7-iron for ya feel like feel like that that like more console friendly guns okay but yeah I'm 13 recently what are you pulling it I'll pull out if I should we join on you Joe yeah join on me I stole it says it you're offline icon and by you I might be a kind mmm it says like a joint I tried I'll see if it works I do be running I'll wait here in actually I'm gonna call my aide today for somewhere been a different okay I'm 15 I got monolithic tempest GI mini reflux mando foregrip and 16 mags yeah yeah and that's like me cloak see and like Barton have been like running that in it and it slaps no but you still use iron sight as well GI mini hey that's why yeah this is my visor is the way until you have different attachments just curious no no I used the exact same oh yeah yeah that's the way rebuilt it from yesterday cuz I think I thought I'd got a decent off match around like maybe there's a ski where I can get a bear would I played with like some locating people last night have so much fun sniping everyone just stand still in Windows it's like bang bang bang three down go go go and then obviously HDR right that's 50 I see no way it's there the quick [ __ ] [ __ ] us nowadays that's not the way Vic that's really do you prefer the X 50 bit over the edge yeah you do yeah yeah yeah that's the way weird so three different snipers here fair enough grass entire Bassett um no English sniper squad go to the dance so what's what's your what's your reasoning behind they all hate the earth and could you use that way more than made purely bullet speed and that's it it just means that you're you're more like is it more of your shots because you have game in front of people I said yeah just easy mode isn't it eh still yeah I'm surprised that I'm bothered again you know they got nerve the grousing so sure you'd have do you think I I'm worried that won't I don't think they will no they don't seem to care that much the funniest thing is talking like the CDL pros I'm like unlike so like what guns do you use and they're like every single game for mp5s one growl nothing ever changes the whole the whole protease and nothing has ever changed I'm like that's got to be so frustrating always the same than one gun what everyone in the game is using one gun is same load out there is a shame I guess that's happens in every procedure right in every game now I guess in CS it's totally different because that's the economy scale and like you've got like an overpowered sniper like you've got there before and I sometimes you can't afford like an m4 and okay so I think that diversify there right think about like games like siege and games like overwatch just like different class and the characters that you have to run it's gonna get rid of that dog oh no I couldn't like anagen I'm already like over sure I've got this okay I got one down okay how many are in there three on that roof now I've got the slug shotgun I have to run away deck starting all over you know can you come some anywhere let go of me it doesn't do any damage dude this is a troll gun bad pimp like they didn't even break his armor one on the rear studs I'm LeBron maxi ruined alright I'll run their Murano I've got the words gether they gave deco sir what do you okay I got ourselves I'm gonna be waiting in yeah I can land on I'm gonna land on this corner building and trying out a gun and come back I'm literally ruined with itself well there's nothing worse than that burst m4 I can't stand it guys it is it is the worst thing in the game right now and it really upsets me that it's on the ground is loo what was wrong with the old gray m4 or the green m4 which was fully automatic why did Infinity Ward have to do us like this I don't know I don't know why Who am I gonna be fighting though whose it might be this guy here is it you know let me spray paint you mr. green want you to be red alright let's do this yeah got the org mr. green so I land on you starter as ever it oh no no you can land on me yeah there's a guy me did you kill the guy in this building no there's people made me that I jacked like this yeah oh yeah I say I think he's gone in the building stud looking they're broke Adama yeah I've got four lawmen our need you some he's inside the building Jack might be with you I don't know where he is yeah I didn't say I've gone that back yeah I'm looking he's just one guy yeah look like one all right buddhini oh my god you going upstairs thank you there you go this should we dip or do in the fire you could go siloing that plays and stuff there push it in the pudding one further back on the on the garages I've got one plate few Jack nothing one play for you dropping in here thank you that was a messy start yeah they're still fighting yeah there's no people in it I'll say hey Jay this way this way this way come on out back yeah back over garages again looking like fuzz you got plates start no no no more playful voice I think they might peak here or on my right I guess it's still on this next time for a long shot froakie's are Maruyama fall back of it I don't think we should take we've got the money we got the money we got the money now yeah well that boys really exposed yeah [Music] just do it too risky by the way Jack that that I'm fully paid-up as a troll have you used it before yeah this boy yeah this one the green one Joe isn't absolute troll you pick it up and it looks nice and it's just not the lowest it gotta be the lowest easy to go repin it again are you saying there burst guns and this I just they're not the one they are not the one they're not the way yeah thank you oh I play stuff all right yeah stopping two plates on the shop drop some more in those are any weapons in here Freya oh yeah mate that's a bit of me mate dropping more plates thinking about coming

just went to the gulag almost straight away dropped it in our base came back though but I think me and Vic got blindsided there by that scored on the right maybe we were a bit too aggressive pushing in there so quick a pop at oh I already use a hundred fov and my friend like 100 FOV I don't want to go higher than that because it starts to get a bit fishbowl for me I like 100 100 a decent number

it's called yes yes gun loud low down or like metal loadout something like that and it's the ground the mp5 and I'll show you in that video you know how to build like the best mp5 growl so I don't remember off the top of my head what it is don't staking it easy that's enough if we want to get Jack at some point huh now I just got a mission possible get out here is that the brunetti Vic it is the Ronettes to go no no sorry keep getting stuck yeah all right all right let's find the exploration game dude should have got in the car damn it did you ever try those in akimbo Vic every Nancy's

enjoyed it I believe I believe you got this oh there's a gun in it they got that load out - you know the three v1 with 30 rounds is it you've only got to kill 18 more people it's easy hide in a bush till there's one person left I said that's the play oh there's people why didn't he just he just paratroops I think he's a freshie he doesn't does he have $500 on it if I kill him I mean there's no sharp left in here's my circle so survive I mean I don't laugh here I'll get laughed you get left yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought that was a team on this hill there it is but you can go round you can go at Bruno I've never really tried the p90 to be honest with you in water I've used it a lot in multiplayer but in warzone I haven't ever like specked out a bill for it and going okay this is a competitive p90 build I'm just haven't done it it's something that I might do in the future just for fun when I don't think it could replace the mp5 or the mp7 but the Unitas have coffee on you can I write that James mm beat the teammates yeah got Molly as well Oh Molly if you need another team no no teammate who's closer than that rich is he so pressed the first guy sell fries you gotta try but

for me Eddy game the other day with two hundred percent fat it was basically in the matrix of that vision ascending my package there's someone else that's the only way that give me losing two hundred percent and they're losing yours as well one of my favorite things in war zone is that all the Americans that call out for this part of the map is titties that's that's what they call it [Music] alright backspin tomorrow nice we had a we had a video to monetize because we said can't and there's another word that can't sounds like on them be using auto caption like really like a UAV mmm I
