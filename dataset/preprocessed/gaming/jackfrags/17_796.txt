a few weeks ago I received an invite to head down to London and visit this strange building here underground it was a mysterious basement complex that I managed to sneak into and inside it I found on speakable Horace they force-fed me donuts made of human flesh they had delicious cake pop shaped like monsters and on dead people the horror the toilets flushed in an unnatural fashion what year is it well turns out I time travelled to World War two when I entered the building and this was a testing facility where participants were recruited to playtest what they called a video game unwillingly I sat down ate more Donuts and began to record and document my experience there and so welcomed the zombie army for dead war now I was immediately interested by this game because eh I quite enjoyed romping through the previous zombie army trilogy with my good friends and be well this game has a zombie shark in it and I do have a profound fondness for sharks also when I discovered that you can do the curb-stomp my level of enjoyment exceeded its typical value [Applause] if you've played any of those after mentioned games though you'll feel right at home here this is a continuation of that series developed again by rebellion for player co-op that can be played in single-player it's you versus nazi zombies as you move through different scenarios and attempt to defeat the undead army hell of a soundtrack here too they've really gone for that John Carpenter vibe and I like it a lot one of the biggest differences I noticed with the game though is in its character customization and progression system before the game starts and up various checkpoints throughout the level you can choose to add perks and upgrade your weapons you can do stuff like increasing the mag size making incendiary or electric rounds even changing your melee attack if you want to deal more damage or perhaps play more of a supporting role and these all have different levels too there is some really cool abilities here to offer you new ways to play I have to say as well I've played a lot of World War 2 video games and as far as I can remember I've never played one which had me fighting against a zombie half-track with a rib cage inside a very unusual it is difficult to beat but protip shoot in the fleshy bits the squishy ones and you'll take it down in no time at all artillery strikes also great for dealing with the zombie hordes like so just make sure that you ain't properly before you fire them to avoid any unwanted and awkward teamkill moments of course with this being a rebellion game they're famous for developing the Sniper Elite killcam you can do that slow-mo snipey shootie stuff here too and occasionally if you nail a dirty headshot you and your whole team will get to view it in beautiful cinematic and gory goodness and if you love a bit of gore and want some more there was some great weapon pickups here too like the chainsaw that really lets you go full 1980s zombie flick twin barrel machine guns which just ripped through the big lads and also this giant shotgun thing that I found called the preacher and let me tell you that makes light work of most enemies out of all of the shotguns that I used though I have to say that the drilling was my fav the sound and satisfaction you get from this thing is just unparalleled in my opinion it's a proper boomstick we are still going in the right direction you could always stab the zombies repeatedly in the head - he run out of ammo seems to work quite well something else that's back is the Horde mode and you know how this goes down you're dropped into a close range and claustrophobic environment with unlockable routes where you start with basic weaponry and then you take on wave after wave of the undead whatever increasing in difficulty and time you're thrown into the mix and buy an upgrade your guns along the way there were some real intense moments here and I'm sure it will be satisfying to see who can survive the longest wrapping things up I only played this for about an hour and a half but I had a lot of fun like I said at the start you enjoyed the previous games I think you'll probably like this one too a new campaign horde levels weapons abilities and bad guys to fight you just got to make sure that Hitler doesn't return from hell and I'm definitely going to be playing this through with my mates and uploading more when it releases so if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there is a link down in the description below and it releases next month on February the 4th for PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC a big thanks to rebellion for sponsoring this video - and of course inviting me down to that call' event if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
