hello everyone and welcome to what could be the end of call of duty warzone as we know it we are live right now and the nuke event apparently is supposed to be happening in a few minutes will it go down on time will there be server cues probably so we're just going to play this by ear you know i'm on discord with tactical brick westy and study those guys are in a game right now but we're just going to be chilling here and waiting to see if there's a playlist update something new we can do something that will happen because we don't know there's a lot of question marks here guys i want to say a big thank you to anyone tuning into the stream right now as well i appreciate you guys being here what's up i can see you all in the chat this is crazy because this is like the first big live war zone event and it could be one of many right like this could be happening for years and years if they keep warzone going and it's successful it's gonna be crazy i don't know really looking forward to it i think lackey did he just invite me to a game no oh here we go join up let's see if they're ready you guys are your match yeah yeah so i predict this isn't going to work you think that everyone's going to log out and then have to log back in i think okay in three minutes everyone's gonna it'll say playlist update required restart game everyone will restart the game and they won't be able to get back in so it's going to be like a ticket website where tickets go live maybe it's going to be good fun either way did you win your match where'd you come we once oh well played we pogged it jack big pogs you came in we heard your voice and we were like we must win it's three was it that was on it was honestly twitch rivals though um could you do a twitch prime advert for me please twitch prime advert that's right so if you've got twitch prime and you're watching study right now twitch.tv you can actually use your free twitch prime token to subscribe to him and he'll get money and you get some awesome little subscription badges and maybe some fulfillment in your life just like me after that twitch wife was winjack [Laughter] no problem some people are telling me they have nine hour server cues nine hours hours over nine hours i'm just going i've just literally opened my phone and there's about 15 notifications from youtube and twitch everyone's live everyone is live so many people in my chat are going i'm in the queue i'm in the queue yep server q server this is gonna be mental apparently there's like so some people are telling me there's gonna be like three phases well it's a two it's a two hour lucky lucky you read it out it was a two-hour event yeah it's a two-hour event awesome this is great uh somebody just tweeted zombies cod just tweeted zombies plus nuke equals question mark uh-oh equals time travel what does it mean come on what does it mean there's about 30 seconds to go lads let's go baby event event event and then we'll get server queued for five hours let's go back everyone in my chat right now is just spamming server q server date on ps4 people are saying oh no oh god who's gonna quit the game first who's quite impressed imagine an 80 gig update ah dear pray pray stand by says uh call of duty oh mate this is gonna be huge a two-hour event this is gonna be real fun if it is that's awesome that would be insane i still don't think they've got the tech to do like a fortnight style one but if it's mainly gameplay-based with like little cutscenes and stuff that would be cool wait i don't care if travis scott in fortnight i'd sooner eat my foot i would genuinely rather have like a salad and a salad in a pasty yeah hang on we can do the epic version westy do you want to try matchmaker and see if it stops what do you mean it's officially 8pm now so do you want me to just try matchmaking into quads yeah see if it like tells you to force a restart or like a playlist update okay let's see it's searching for a match right now if it finds one i'll pull this out okay i'm just kidding i don't know how this is gonna work yeah i'm actually scared yeah because it's officially eight o'clock now have cod tweeted anything yeah no final alert your official order give him hell and get out with a picture of the of stitch and the zombies oh gosh did you read the final orders yeah yes yeah lackey read them out on stream it's quite cool sounds

know we know to expect the uh the juggernaut drops so we need to get that fell off the car and i'm not joking i'm surrounded by six zombies it's like 28 gauge layer it's so crazy by the way the helicopters are trying to shoot the zombies i think i think that's what the helicopter is trying to do yeah they're there to help us with extraction did you come back as a zombie straight away like a yeah you did yeah insta all right we're gonna win this come on we got yes we're gonna extract and everyone else is gonna stay in the dance this is so safe this is really cool but like i'm i actually

the destruction of warzone servers part one christ oh god i mean jackie too i don't want to be that guy that's like oh i can't do it there are people stuck in the cervical that can't even get into the game we're lucky enough to be here we'll try again okay so third time lucky that's so weird so there's like three parts to this yeah there's three parts to the destruction of vedansk apparently you think they were expecting this many players i don't think you can ever predict it though to be honest no i guarantee you though um all of the people that that haven't played war zone for ages are coming back now they're trying to they're trying to get in for this and this is their first impression i mean just i'm not i'm just surprised there's not a banner that's saying please buy cold do you think other servers might be more stable oh i don't know it's a bit risky stuff because we'd have to log out yeah you'd have to log out and then the server queue oh god yeah a lot of people just haven't been able to get in so did you keep crashing yeah twice in a row dude yeah we just crashed twice as well guys we've got 40 000 people watching the stream right now thank you so much for coming along that's absolutely insane i think that's actually a record i think we had about 39 000 when i streamed the modern warfare 2 remastered campaign but 40 000 for me is just i'm so i'm so humbled by that thank you so much guys honestly it means a lot today and i want to say a big thank you as well to all the uh new members thank you so much for the super chats guys you're all awesome thank you thank you thank you hopefully we can actually get around to this get it finished and see what happens at the end because it's just part one part two and three are gonna come in the next couple hours

um yeah we could predict this isn't the one that just goes up there yeah that's going to be crazy just stick together like glue just stick together like glue we're landing on atc i'm landing on atc oh yeah we don't really get guns do we yeah land on atc and then wait for the juggernaut to come along and murder the server again oh don't get shot instantly down the sky insta jack 12. i just turned somebody into a zombie instantly i nearly got hit by a missile i just uh i just didn't um agree the truce with the guy next to me and wiggling and saying no no no no don't shoot me i'm surprised there's one down here i'm telling you next match if we don't make it this long just go there north east yeah yeah over there right okay green on green they they're all the same locations all the same locations are you not going atc lackey [Applause] all the guns are shotguns and smg's someone just airstrikes everything i seen an needed yet yeah people pushing you start people pushing you three men

how do i do it i've forgotten you've got jump gas [Music] though that's the good news right i'm gonna try and go for the uh the jug i'm trying for the jug questing i can't i can't get it i can't get it yeah why not keep it safe keep me safe okay because i'm a zombie i'm a zombie yeah don't be coming in there's a guy there player there me shot by the heavy heavy zombies it's the juggernauts the juggernauts are crashing the servers as soon as you take a juggernaut it just crashes well yeah it's just crashed it here this sucks dude what the hell oh my god how long are we gonna be here for i'm prepared to stick it out if you guys are yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely same thing we'll just keep going that's fine just keep going yeah take the juggies out activision let's go get rid of them you don't need them i bet you they'll do an update and they'll take them out i guarantee you yeah and then we'll be in the server queue yeah oh man that's rough right yeah let's go play uh some regular again i had it yeah i saw you literally took it and then it crashed the server yeah i mean unless they removed them this is going to happen for the next hour uh apparently some people have been able to um have been able to do it maybe uh some people have finished around some people have finished it i think uh ali a was streaming and he managed to do it apparently okay just rng in it i guess whitelist it's been every time though isn't it it's been every time at the same time no wait hang on a minute i'm watching it now and i think that i think they've got the same problems i think they've got the same problems as everybody else everybody crashing please remove juggies i don't understand surely they you know stress tested this and how can you though lucky how can you you can't stress this other like this nuke for dance cannot the service you think this one's going to be the one that we're going to get the uh the final ending yeah are we going to get rid of you i'd definitely stick around if i was uh yeah right now everyone stayed please do you think do you guys think the whole server is crashing or just our squad no no it's the entire server it's definitely the entire sub every time come on fingers crossed fingers crossed we can do this come on i know we can do this uh sizzle thank you for becoming a member kiss the crook thanks for the fire man that's very

that i've lost 8 000 views a giant egg oh wait a giant egg a giant crash you've seen the nuke launcher on the ground i think it's over my purple the nuclear codes oh i found the white list apparently at six minutes and four seconds we've crashed both times really it's the same every time yeah it's the same every time i think oh that sucks some people saying go on american servers yeah the game is crashing always at six minutes and four seconds gone yeah but if we switch to the us then we'll have security we'll sit in the cervical don't bother with the jugs we'll just we'll just camp out i need to oh the music in the background is the cold war zombies theme [Music] juggles this is still really cool even though it's crashing even though i kept crashing this is still really cool oh yeah please take shelter immediately let's see if we can beat the final boss for six minutes and four american servers are crashing at seven minutes in four seconds oh chucky chucky chucky truck coming in truck coming in don't let them kill us again on the roof he's trying to kill me why he do why are you trying to kill me why are you cool oh yeah yep yep yep yep so they're not allowed to kill us but we can kill them yeah that's the rule yeah okay i mean i've just got two shotguns it's great i've got i've got a bruin it's more fun one of the jokes has been claimed oh okay it might be working oh okay no don't jinx it okay we got to the second containment thing we didn't get to that last time oh the mud drawer was sick oh you've got it immediately immediately in jackie weaver i mean we surely need to get stay like mid zone which is by this job they are basically here we're kind of in the best position here we're in a good spot we'll just wait back upon right okay somebody said it was what six minutes and four years yeah so we're about a minute away we're about about a minute away maybe it's crashing when something else is supposed to happen yeah but the first server lagged a lot first didn't it yes he did yeah still alive i mean we could just be getting upset with multiple unlucky servers make him play boys make him pay kill him again [Music] [Applause] oh that was close [Music] oh god this is mental yeah there's the rose there's the road the rock there oh let's just hold this compound yeah yeah it's crashed you kidding dude come on come on 650 650 it's crashed again oh do we risk a different region i don't think you'll make a difference like yeah i don't know well some people in my chat saying that they've managed to finish it really yeah i'm just yeah uh js is messaging me from the other room playlist update you've got a playlist up to date another chat don't know uh yeah jess is sending me messages from the other rooms some people have already completed it so do we just jump to a different region and try i'll play this update available playlist update okay will now be downloaded so the update will now be downloaded i got it i got it i got it so they fixed it i think they might have disabled something that was causing the problem wait so how the hell do i get to play this update um relaunch your game i'll try because if you match make it like you remember jack at the first time we did it it kicked him out yeah um so it might it might kick you and say you need to do a playlist update yeah apparently um it's happened for a couple of people already maybe i didn't need to do the playlist update maybe yeah maybe there was like a like a false equivalency between us baby wouldn't surprise me so what's part two then um well apparently the event's happening for two hours yeah part two exfiltration exfiltration yeah maybe you never know question i'll join on you matchmaker for me and see if it forces an update yeah sure i'm sorry i had 22 000 viewers and they've all gone because of this because of the crash it's fine okay i'm not being told maybe there was a discrepancy because i'm not being forced okay fair fair hmm maybe i wonder if this was uh was found by qa and i mean whatever it was they found it quickly oh apparently it popped up on my screen and i wasn't paying attention okay okay it's all good it's all good let's do it let's hope that this one works then we just have to survive down the okay okay yeah survive you don't want to just land up here where the juggie always good idea goes i think we need to make a play for the judge if we're going to live because you have to bear in mind there will be a point where there are 140 zombies but what if we need to serve them guys thank you for tuning in 42 000 viewers right now insane eric thank you for the 20. benjamin thanks for the 20 don't let the crashes get you down i'll try not to renzo thank you for becoming a member man cm thank you so much for becoming a member appreciate you guys what's up vigilante fox in the chat hello pancakes eric w what's up guys all time lucky hey let's do it go to usa honestly i think if we try and change region we'll just be in a big queue i don't know like don't know how that'll work uh super they reduced the number of players oh did they was it 150 before oh yeah it was you're right yeah yeah do it hello let's do it guys let's do it three jugs get picked up the game crashes so we need to defend a jug then did you guys know it's the player count yes yes so if we just defend the juggie maybe yeah i i think it'd be fine now i think he'll be fine now yeah so heads over here where that jug was or do you want to do the one i think the north one is the best option the green over on green mark yeah blue i think we can run up the hill we can run up the hill okay here we go let's land on the main set buildings here wait purple or orange over in that direction we'll go there yeah we'll get that way just yeah it was roughly you know

to earn a new calling card they tweeted that uh charlie intel tweeted it so you have to stay alive it's called containment protocol yeah containment program we didn't get it because we we died basically do it should we play it again yeah let's see we can win it yeah see if we can do it see if we can stay alive be the last team i mean all three juggies would be the player wouldn't it yeah uh so apparently did you know that nuke that nuke came in from off the map that didn't come in from one of the places on the map okay so some people are saying that that could be the erzakhstan map and it could be the one that might come with the next modern warfare game interesting i mean that's a long shot come on that's a lot that is a long shot we've got rumored cod world war ii first so so i mean modern warzone tweeted earlier today the anybody who thought it was going to be a free skin would be deeply disappointed so okay maybe so when's part two then it wasn't going to be a reskin it wasn't going to be a new new new name all the duty just tweeted target acquired i've just tweeted a little five second clip let's have a look on the controller account yeah it basically points to where the nuke lands did you watch where the nuke actually hit it hits the fire station next to stadium yeah yeah it does so that's what the little clip is showing right now wow target acquired so do you think there's another event later tonight yeah maybe it's going to be when the server's shut down right i don't know like a fortnight blackhole event fortnite this is much better with music i will say that have you bumped your music up to 100 yeah it's definitely worth it okay i'll put the music to 100. we'll do that yeah do that for the chat love that i do feel sorry for the people in the server queue yeah marley is still in the queue like that's awful man yeah that's not good for him bless him where do you want to go this time i don't know esther yeah just get let's go atlanta land here that worked last time all right cool so i've turned the music up and i'm putting my faith in lackey it's worth it 100 it's atmospheric and i've already been jack 12. you're dead nice someone's just taking a plate off of me already it's like he zipped past and the jack 12 just swiped the plate out so apparently the calling card bugged for us we should have got it okay that's fair enough probably pop up at some point well someone in my chat just said there is another event at 10 p.m okay so we just stay online then we'll just get an hour and 15 minutes from now yeah i don't think i could play this for an hour and 15 minutes so what i might do is like end my stream now and then do another one at 10 p.m don't turn your modern warfare off yeah yeah stay in the lobby we'll stay in discord explain this i mean you could just do a countdown timer phase two or something jack phase two you might get the um the limit of uh three of us within 24 hours yeah i already i posted the video today and on the live stream i wanted to do like a cut of the event to be honest it would be cool if you could play like normal dance while this was going on no it's too much for the hamster shot for service they're falling out of their wheels okay the music does make it slightly more atmospheric not gonna lie do you want to go for the jug or are you happy to just grab me i think you need it oh it's one of those zombies i'm not getting them juggies then yeah you could go atc with a juggie that's a good point northern zombie what was that jackson you could go atc with the juggie i just sit out there yeah that might be a plan although what and then try and um sideways all the way oh you could do a slam and just kill all the zombies how are we gonna do this guys because we just got shotguns and no don't cluster strike oh no they're getting it i think they're on it again let's just stop them now oh i died no i don't i got it get out of there eliminate humans i have to eliminate i'm going to go in the bunker and see if i can get some loot like it i'm with you luke lacking lackey i mean it's nice because the zombie the whole of last round i'll be the zombie this time god imagine if we'd have gone top of dan like you could do the ultimate juggernaut ground pound oh god yes i think that will crash the server oh jack i'll stick with you just in case all right cool we we killed everyone in the server um they're indeed there's a lot of pickup killstreaks you can't come back anyone see a zombie no but you just keep coming back as a zombie so it's fine you don't get anything zombie zombie oh they should have put that live zombie royale there's no other loot down here is there there's a red room here oh right what is that noise it's um a helicopter it's on balls can you access the machine there striker oh the machine is off yeah machine is soft the machine is off god your eyes look mentally wesley this would be a great screenshot yeah that looks cool get the thumbnail let's go [Music] genuinely surprised that they didn't have a random like set of zombies at the start and then make it so you can't pvp each other yeah that'd be cool you guys are chalked you just canceled me stud oh yeah truck it's actually best if we run a quad bike because it's yeah the only thing that can out run okay the zombies have you have you got the car up there yeah yeah bring it down there for the juggie [Music] yeah oh god the jockey's coming no no no no no not like this yeah like an emp like an emp yeah i am [Music] right you could just come down [Music] yeah we can be teams we could be friends friends [Music] oh no i wasn't even looking at it right over him check in [Music] oh no the zombies have gone oh that was close [Applause] zombies could use the repel really coming i up know you carried that tactical gear [Applause] can they make it through the window i don't think no i don't think zombies maybe not i mean do you want to guard the repel eliminate there's only 15 players left guys we have to go anyway are we going are we going to make it the jug's still alive get to the expo i'm lucky yeah i'm running um i'm gonna get my uh tank rover oh no no no no what what happened [Music] the zombie just punched the car and it exploded [Applause] they've been protected oh no not like this we're just having a zombie fight there's two juggies in the gaps they're gonna die wait oh nuke inbounds we're still fighting off these damn zombies still fighting off these damn zombies oh my god this is the juggies dead there's there's the x-fil heli there's the x-fil there's one druggie alive still [Music] healthy population healthy population 146. yeah look watch this nuke it comes from off the map it's just in a field though oh actually no it's like a mill base or something yeah it looks like a mill base off the map number one with the re-royal yeah for now we're about to get down kills on the board right now [Laughter] oh everyone in the chat right should i just leave again yeah yeah yeah just don't leave the game yeah leave the game running try and render with the game well there we go we've got the calling card now hey nice and then yeah i unlocked stippled grip tape and the grassland skin i mean i could play some modern warfare for a bit maybe some modern warfare what just play on the stream yeah and wait for uh yeah i'm down i'm down for waiting like staying up yeah yeah we might as well just keep going yeah i'm down yeah because if if we stop all that's going to happen is when we go back live again do you want to play modern warfare i mean i'm i'm inviting you into lobby jack we're just going to get we're going to play together it's the first time we've actually played modern warfare together i don't think we ever have now no i mean yeah the loadouts are completely different aren't they we need to quickly make a couple of loadouts uh cycle oh the cycles will be rampant especially in hardcore mode like i feel like the as foul would just dominate in end of year surely right it's quickest time to kill yeah mp5 mate ease so clearly we all know the reason why the events split up right part one and part two whatever um because if they tried to do it all at once uh the entire servers across the world would be on fire the world would be on fire the world would be we have to wait exactly an hour and three minutes for part two yeah that's fine should we do search and destroy together for batman oh man i've never yeah i mean i'm down but yeah yeah it's it's pretty sweet isn't it toxic search and destroy we could do gunfight 2v2s to play against each other or do you want to play yeah yeah yeah that'd be sick can we do that can we swear either way can we do it as custom games is that it custom guys i gameplay guys hear me out what rust snipers only gun rust snipers finally we just played that for an hour oh old school rough snipers only [Music] whatever yeah you got any guns that need to rank it up no all the well no they're all done well we'll just do shoot the ship whatever i don't know yeah i got the reward again that's weird i'm going to put the calling card on though obviously newest first pain pain pain pain most containment protocol where is it [Applause] it keeps telling me that i've got the reward over and over again yeah i'm just doing the same comment reward we're against the clan guys look at those oh no chris we are a clan basically we're a youtube club let's get uh let's get started sweating in his boots to see if he's really the best sniper in rust 1v1 let's go is that you know why have you all got cycles [Applause] i need this gun oh no let's just wait for part two with some delightful we have control oh god crush them [Applause] don't worry lucky thank you you get the aggro i'll shoot him in the back oh he was there so long since i played modern warfare did you not level the side comes up in it yeah i did but i haven't like you know haven't played modern warfare like properly there's a man i'm mine [Applause] i couldn't find anyone there you go there's a lad time extension oh god oh god so another playlist update in just under an hour then yeah is that what we think is that what we're expecting that's confirmed [Applause] we wait for the event lol this is the thing i was gonna make a video on the event but like there's gonna be multiple parts it's gonna be a bit hard to do that i don't think it's like it's not really worth it [Applause] [Applause] i need to steal your mp5 if you died [Applause] [Applause] like it's 2008 [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there it is oh tactical nuke inbound boys watch out map's gonna get new let's go let's go boom newton [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you've been cranked you've been

point i got killed they updated the blog what does the blog say someone's in my chat said they've updated uh one hour remains to experience the final moments of the dance as we know it so they've said that was four minutes ago so basically there's an hour left for them to [Music] yeah guys we won our first game in modern warfare together i refuse to believe i don't know the game big part are we gonna say it like it will be [Music] it was pretty i thought it was pretty good oh come on oh no not shipment oh no get your 60 round mags in boys that's i'm telling you benny hit 43 000 peak

the five any suggestions for getting past the fetching online profile lube i'm living victoriously through your honor i think the servers are just jacked okay to be honest um i was logged into the game about an hour before the event went live because i knew that something like this was going to happen just because it always does with these large scale events in battle royale games so i i don't have any advice for you would just be keep trying it and if you're in a queue just stay in it every once in a while i'm unmuting the other guys the other team's calling us dog youtubers well wait it's

along in a minute and do not close it i got debated so you said what don't close the gate like it that's what people are saying yeah yeah but i mean there's so many people watching who knows what's real yeah i mean i i'm looking at my chat and it's just conflict backwards and forwards backwards and forwards like i mean i say we all just sit like we don't know what's gonna happen right let's put let's put some music on in the background some people will already say that they have all the game modes new playlist update did you got one no no my chat i'd just say yeah um charlie intel tweeted

on a minute nuclear fallout and goals for dance get a glimpse of what happens next drop into rebirth island and battle all night in the limited time versions of resurgence mini royale and kingslayer search for clues amid the aftermath it's um reap it's rebirth island at night i don't think there's an event i don't think there's an event for it i think it's just rebirth island at night okay well i can join you i stick so i've got the update yeah if you send me an invite it's getting debated i can't do it this is just still connecting to online services for me do you want to see if we can spam you some invite see if it makes difference yeah joining game session also i've just sent you guys the um uk times yeah bonanza has fallen seek safety from rebirth update your comms console investigate rebirth return tomorrow to rebirth for updated instructions so basically i reckon tomorrow at 8pm uh british summer time there'll be an event for updated instructions i think that'll be part two um

slayer king slayer just tdm go come on dice you can do it you can do it dice i believe in you so part two is out then basically bravo six going dark so you guys like still reconnecting what's i said yeah just joining game session forever so that's why you don't want to restart your uh destruction of the dance has been extended for another hour connection to online services no if you click counsel nothing happens you're in wesley are you yeah me and lackey are in a lobby together well if you why don't you guys go ahead and then if me and jack can get in we can play because i don't want to hold you back yeah we'll roll a mini royale duo just go ahead like you know i'll tell you what i'll i'm just going to try and restart my game and then um if it doesn't work if it doesn't work you guys go ahead i'll just watch your stream and then i'll restream it if that's okay with you guys yeah go for it i could meme that rebirth island playlist takes place 15 minutes after the events in verdansk okay i've already we could probably like hop on for an hour tomorrow just to get some um distraction of a dance scout oh you know the playlist will be gone won't it yeah play don't put me in a queue don't put me in a queue don't do it don't film me now playing now okay the game's launching come on jack come on baby get in the lobby with us jack jack so we're starting tonight so yeah we can we can't me and lackey can go ahead but like 20 minutes 20 minute server cue jack no all the way down does that actually change or does it just say that forever i mean somebody told me that the 20 minute queue has lasted two hours but people are saying somebody said um i was in a queue restart game and gotten it instantly so if you just kill exactly keep keep going restart a couple times yeah yeah aculite said if you just keep restarting it he just managed to get through and it put him in yeah there's a new location on rebirth called the control center oh it's replaced you know the the construction site that uh that's over on the um like the north um west side of the map yeah um it's replaced that so it's now a building that's been put there jack apparently you should just keep restarting that's what i'm trying now yeah you just have to keep restarting should we just run it westy yeah me and me and lackey will go into duo's loading level loading level check now you guys carry on server yeah server queue again i'll try i'll try again a couple times really yeah to be fair when i normally get server cues i just oh f4 on repeat and then eventually i get in i mean i'm not getting i've been here for 10 minutes gone connecting to online services nothing's changed i do get 15 minutes after the destruction of another dansk oh baby so it's at night it's like okay this is gonna be interesting because it's gonna be super chaotic lucky yeah it's gonna be pain it's gonna be pain oh baby well i'm gonna try one more time chat if it doesn't work we'll watch um westy stream and like oh lucky stream i can't get into it it's really annoying connecting to online services fetching online profile do not put me in a queue please don't put me in a queue come on chat we can do this we can do it chat so last time it loaded up and it put me straight in a queue but this is different it made a sound then hopefully tomorrow they iron some of this out they need to like quadruple their server capacity or something fetch an online profile pogba's i think we're i think we're screwed guys i think we're screwed i can't even press cancel or anything now so once more i really want to play it because you know we've waited this long right to show you guys so i think it would be a shame if we don't get to play it load it up one more time my mate johnny messaged me he said i think we've established that 40 000 people watching the stream is impossible to moderate on youtube oh man god it's so frustrating so close i'm sorry about this guys there's not much i can do about it is there so i'll load up um one of the other guys streams load at westy stream and then we can take a look at that see what it looks like a space racy or something to that that's night time [Music] here we go this is some music there's music playing in the background door's popping below unless i shoot no i'm on the roof dude i'm on the roof yeah multiple doors the cell block isn't blown up no it's not blown up dude it's full night time that's interesting this is it this is in the past of course it's it's in the past rebirth's in the past wait wait hang on now that doesn't make any sense because the dance nuke was current day and it says 15 minutes after verdansk in the future the original rebirth uh yeah footsteps on my side lucky they can't hear me by the way i've got them muted we can just see the only thing that makes sense right oh no checking update you guys just got checking for update i just got checking for update oh first partners yeah i'm in uh still trying on jax well we can pull out lucky's dead we can all go in there wait no no no no yeah no yeah wait for received watch wait actually no because control center was a construction site so i don't know the time make any sense you got inside i got in yeah i just kept on literally just quit restart quick restart and then i never got the q symbol it just said connecting waiting for update and then it did it yeah i tried that a few times we have some confusion here um what's the concept the prism block hasn't been blown up in this in this version right and the control center is like a ussr space race kind of room so it's set in the 80s then that version of rebirth yeah in current in the rebirth prior to this that was a construction yard right so how but how does that make any sense hang on a minute they've updated the construction meme there's a rocket there's a big rocket here there's a bloody missile right next to me it's a icbm the icbm didn't work for me stud try again very confusing i'm being memed i mean i need that so the old rebirth is from the past and the current rebirth is 15 minutes after the new oh okay whoa i mean that doesn't make any confusing well yeah they repaired the there was a little skull poster back there let's see where on the side of the machine so they repaired the prison that's it and then they built the control center so the rebar we were playing was in the past lucky load out come to load up oh we've got a chance of actually winning this first game this could be pogba's it's just really confusing how they've gone about here well it's not fully explained yet yeah i'm still just restarting over and over again i've been instantly mulled and i've been mullet too i've been mullered as well i shouldn't have done that i should have just had it right now i'm trying to rebirth oh i'm going to go like hang on oh god this is the goo like that we should have got a minute ago it's cold war themed it just keeps putting me in the circus why is everything ccp cold war themed don't get it the timing makes no sense oh the grenade he had no health dude and he cooked the nade as well he cooked it fair play to him okay so uh this this is cool stop do you want to jump in um well let's let jack do a couple more tries and then i'm playing still playing uh we just died he just died i'll sit well let's just wait a couple of minutes to see if jack can get in yeah for sure it took me about uh three attempts jack yeah i restarted like 10 times now i switched to asia once and then switched back to europe once as well just to see that didn't do anything it's still it's sorted the queue but you know try anything checking for updates i think i've got it oh yeah baby yes pogba's or all the boys together yeah i'm in i'm in number one victory royale yeah four times we bout to get down here we go let's go all right let's invite you all in right uh jackie weaver where are you my friend by the way oh oh no it says you're not not joinable and i cannot send you a request is jack on yeah i'm in the menu jack says it says offline i might be able to find you in the just give it a sec give it a sec because it sometimes takes a while to load the friends yeah mine's definitely not working no if not i guess we could just do solo maybe we'll join them through regiments but we don't have a regiment no we don't have a regiment what's the regime i don't understand why wow i don't under like i can see you i can see you offline it says you're offline but i can't stop it says you're online but i literally can't send you a thing i can't join i can't join

and it will work i mean how do i make a regimen uh memes online but how are you going to invite us because apparently you can join through the regimen right which totally makes sense i love video games in 2021 you know they just work don't they seamless sorry the name you've chosen has already been taken by another beams on toast tape no it won't be lucky it'll be in the evening so the part three will be at eight and five it'll be the same as it was today do you know they've really confused a lot of people because they haven't named this part too they've just put rebirth back in can you invite us it's not finding a bloody regiment i could try and make a regiment he keeps saying his name has been taken this name has been taken it's westie's regiment pog dog sorry the tag you've chosen oh it's the it's the blooming tag how like how is every tag i'll just put meme lands who's got meme lands pg dog regiment tag has been taken you kidding hectic dogger just put like a random oh wait wait no no what about my plants i've got one i've got one you've got one what is it what's it called invite us today what is this how do we even join a regiment he has to invite us to it yeah but he can't he probably can't invite us though you must be able to i must be able to surely no no no no you go into the room yeah no invites received right okay invite us all right okay yeah yeah yeah yeah

was that word how is it like this how do i join you yeah we have to invite you um how did you invite me lucky i i right-clicked your name and pressed invite but i can't do that for jack for some reason yeah i can't do that for jack either hey why is the game manage regimen but why i've made jack an officer maybe that'll what's that going to do i'm going to kick you from the regiment jack frags i've transferred the ownership for the regiment jack yeah we try to make you have to work out how to get a party together wow yeah part two is figuring out how to actually join on each other oh my this is this is so weird why is this like this wait jack can you try appearing offline and then going back online again yeah offline online by the way since i joined the regimen oh wait wait it's updated it's just updated uh i still can't invite jack he still says he's offline and i still couldn't even i can't even invite stodd i'm still not allowed i mean i'm in the pie yeah i know but it says surely that's the way the remake the party i guess what else can we do i don't know i can i can join geeky pasta god oh yeah wesley doesn't have to be the the party leader i was the party leader well i can join straight on lackey i can join straight on him joining game session there you go jack can you see this what are you doing i'm whispering to you no in the game why is it like this there's nothing in the game what if i make the party can i invite you guys to oh man you don't invite me anymore lucky hold up let me find out in the regiment start invite five yeah so you can do it that way maybe it says that we're not even friends though i mean i can send you guys a friend request delete all friend requests and retry i mean i don't have any i don't have any friend requests i have a huge list of block players i can't even see you online this is part two this is the event getting in a party together my friend requests and then it let me join you it's almost like it got to

tags please stop inviting me to regiments now guys thank you oh god oh god oh god let's go baby pain where do you guys twitch chat was right yeah the regimens worked i think we need to get some more twitch prizes right so we all need to run ghost and cold-blooded why no one can see us okay um yeah we'll need to create uh oh it's already loading the level i'm not going to have a challenge to just finally all right i've blocked any more regiment invites okay here we go night time nice reba let's go yeah let's go baby at night thank you so much for your patience we finally made it this is part two of the nuke event let's get in it's good fun isn't it really i'm enjoying this uh chopin thank you for becoming a member football thank you for the 10. you can join warzone matches through discord i did not know that that's interesting let's go we're in we're in boys [Applause] you got large posters today jordan thank you man what's my opinion about the event i really enjoyed it killer hacker i mean this is this is part 1b i guess if part two is tomorrow yeah it was uh it was pretty hype like i had this sick moment where i was the um the juggernaut i had the minigun at the expel and we were just absolutely swarmed over run it was awesome i loved it this is part one b i guess i don't know i don't know if anything special is gonna be time's over you're going to the war zone here we go what i mean did anything special happen can or is it just try and win no it's just night time dude i think this this i think this it's genuine i think it's like happening in real time like the dance got nuked a couple of hours later or 15 minutes later you're at rebirth island and like we're now like in the night right so then i bet i bet you rebirth will be at night until tomorrow and then there'll be event tomorrow at eight on rebirth island that will then introduce the new man guaranteed okay we're getting control center there's people already in it it's a rose game is this besides [Music] oh that's an enemy why are you straight for that there's not supposed to be yeah that's weird i'm pretty sure there's nothing easter eggs it's kind of ruining my vibe a small amount yeah i was enjoying the serious nighttime version and then boom easter eggs [Applause] i'm not broken have you got the music on music yeah yeah i'm telling you someone's already got that loadout what that's so fast so is there where's this big rocket you were talking about so there's an icbm that's like down here guys getting loading oh my gosh i need a little bit more tiny bit more come to me maybe um somebody's just saying this could be like a beat a temper a nuclear winter so yeah so where's this miss our cam when we get the blue on blue jack when we get the loading we'll go down there there's an icbm that's over there and they fix the holes in the uh in the prison roof they also fixed the ones over at construction search for cruising the new building what search for the easter eggs can you launch it ignition ignition just shoot the bottom of it yeah i don't think that's how nuclear missiles work they've kind of explained the timelines really poorly uh i was trying to go up here like tony hawk i don't think you can push into continental ballistic missile but i'm gonna try like it you know moving here tony hawk i launched my r6d and it's run now have they added the miniguns [Applause] easter eggs why are there easter eggs on this there's a bunker you can't open it yet where's the bunker where do we want to go guys we need to go get some kills it's there are so many people asking me if part two is an airstrike technically this is like three years this is [Applause] [Applause] oh i'm getting batman vibes i don't know yeah i've got them yeah he's a bit gotham isn't it i'm down did that one gotta get your mvg's on lads yeah i've got targeted mvgs [Music] there's an easter egg somewhere where's the one on the bridge i don't i don't i've got nothing so weird man part one's been extended by an hour yeah part two that doesn't mean part two's happening immediately after yeah it's happening tomorrow apparently yeah they've they announced that they said that it's happening tomorrow yeah everybody thought that the second phase was this but i mean this is part of it this is part of it i mean if it doesn't feel like it it is part of it yeah what if we win something like that missile might launch and then august and then you can see what happens oh someone's highlighting me meters huh nice someone was highlighting me from here oh okay yeah yeah they're coming down one's pushing down on on towards you lucky is the guy pushing i should probably push over there sounds like there's a heli is that lucky yeah yeah i'm just trying to see if there's anything new around the place this is all new isn't it sorry yeah there's another icbm in the security area oh interesting well they're going to launch aren't they multiple around the mountain it's in three so far you reckon they're like [Applause] [Music] on the team on the hill [Applause] down one on the roof i think he was at the boxes the whole time coming back in five legally illegally enemies i'm so bad with this car 98 tonight i'm gonna go for that loadout yeah repositioning it right here [Applause] [Applause] oh easter egg crate [Applause] [Applause] i mean i'm interested to see if anything happens at the end i don't think it will but i think i genuinely think like rebirth at night is like part of the new meme this will be part of season three it's just something to play overnight while people wait and that's what i think i think it's genuinely like part of like a real time like a top real time line i was hoping that i could see reba i thought you said  i mean is it not in the distance i'm pretty sure alcatraz island is within range of uh repositioning from behind north north 350. lucky you're on him there's the guy in there there's a laser here where did he get there there was a sniper there's a whole team on top of control center i mean um north west triple threat uh lucky there must be on the roof on the other side he's jumped off that one two below me in the building below me they're gonna carry a child yeah they're gonna try they're gonna try and come up 100 i'm watching is it this side you got any ar ammo please come on yeah thank you they're going to come on my side i think on the roof roof of control hostile uh it's a fake cdr they're running past me now i think follow me enemy uav overhead do you want us to come to you todd [Applause] [Music] just hold it cam they've got to come to us i'm holding this side to make sure they're in flank over there yeah i just got one too they're not coming up this side i don't think they're gonna be on the left side of somewhere they're below they're below me still they're still below me you can hear them yeah three men below three gordon freeman below us god three i've only got 26 bullets the place where gordon freeman was oh i can hear him underneath me now come yeah two of them five point eight one underneath you just understand guys soon well they'll get stuck in that corner if they don't said a cat new there's another one uh there's of course there's four teams still alive oh yeah we don't have gas masks do it nope damn what do you need cam enemy driver if you've got any guys if you've got any let's see if we can hear the other teams fighting around 10 meters still a group of three below me how i mean they're all inside they're just they're just going to bump into it but why you would do why would you there you go to play now all right there's a group of four 25 they're underneath they're pretty much coming underneath jack okay if i can get stunned i'll just push in and try and just 12 meters they're ready come on [Music] yeah i'm going to leave it there loud sounds really good fun yeah same time tomorrow have a good night guys we won we did it so part one b let's call it you have to fall back to rebirth island and it's night time 15 minutes afternoon so i'm guessing tomorrow will be part two a and part two b or just part two and then it's gonna somehow trigger the new map i guess those missiles will launch and it will just like do something i don't know i mean the rumors are that we're gonna go back to 1984 so we'll see we will see i've had a great time tonight oh guys i have to be honest and the fact that we got 60 000 concurrent viewers it's just like that blows my mind man i never thought that that would be a thing but there we go there it is so many new members as

buy anything that creator will get a bit of kickback from that just a nice easy way to help support someone um also while i've got you guys i am going to show you something which we launched yesterday i'm just going to bring it up on my desktop here this is something really special that we've i've been working with an artist on this for a couple months now and it's a brand new poster with it's also available on a t-shirt warzone year one it's all custom artwork by a guy called taisel who is a brilliant artist and the link is in the description below should be pinned to the stream as well that's where you can get it it's only available for four weeks and i thought that while we're here while i've still got you guys watching that we would actually go through and look at all these references because a lot of people ask me to do that so this basically summarizes year one of warzone and it has some references to events and easter eggs stuff that happened in my videos and other people's videos um a lot of it speaks for itself but obviously we we've got ghost who's one of the coolest operators we've got helicopters and rpgs on helicopters you know we hit some nice nice shots in year one stadium in the background and downtown just so you know where we are you know we're in warzone we've got the raven which is one of my favorite takedowns when they introduce that and then we've got the juggernaut otherwise known as the big chungus he's got my logo there pew pew the finger guns you can do the slam and also we say no to the dmr because you guys i'm sure remember the insane dmr meta that just dominated the game for months and months and months snake shot revolvers i was a good meme or a bad meme until they were nerfed trophy system here on the jeep got the attack dog knight fang believe it or not nightfang was actually one of the first meta operators in the game because it had a ghillie suit and when warzone came out everyone was like yo this is pay to win you can just blend in so you know i used to use the skin all the time uh the spr here you know there was the meme with that where it was hit scan and it was broken that was good fun zombies nice tie into the halloween event but also to what's going on now with them overtaking the dansk got the keypad on the bunkers here there are some numbers on there that are relevant let's say uh we've got a chess piece i was actually sent a real-life chess piece at the start of was it modern warfare season 2 and inside it was a usb with like a little teaser of the stadium you know when they opened up the stadium we got the projector i was also sent a projector with slides on it which led to the reveal of black ops cold war and also of course here on the loadout drop code jack frags in the cod store there it is well i absolutely love this artwork i think it's brilliant like it looks great as a poster but you can get it as a t-shirt as well link is in the description below if you want to check that out and
