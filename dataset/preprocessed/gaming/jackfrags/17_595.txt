i don't know what it is but warzone it just feels like it's breaking a bit lately good job i love that that's just there why is there a dog why became a dog was more terrifying oh no oh no oh why is that it's a beautiful weapon are you seeing this yep i can see it uh dice uh okay so we can't use that whoa no it's fine it's fine oh the scope kind of works now okay you want to get a nice thumbnail with that because i'd go outside maybe remove all the elements and get a lovely little thumbnail and then respect look at the sky as easy to get out lovely we're gonna cut that out that takes about 20 years guys it's falling apart but hello hope you're doing well this video was supposed to be about the fam ass and how good it is in warzone now because they buffed it recently but i tried to play a few matches with it and this was the only good clip that i got there's enemies two enemies dead ahead yeah yeah ground level three one down two down three down hello thank us so in conclusion don't use the fire mask in war zone it's still not very good it's really good in multiplayer though in warzone that's not just don't even go there also i did turn voice comes on recently on warzone which can lead to some hilarious moments like this nice job giant beautiful [Music] didn't sound too happy with that one did he but do you remember this guy from the trailer he's in the shop now i bought it only for one reason though i don't like the skin but it comes with two blueprints one of them is a growl and one of them is the vector and they've got golden bullets that turn your enemies into golden statues and then shatter like this hello i've got to say this right the lower half of his leg has gone gold this that's everywhere and then it just puffs out of existence but the man just did drop out of the sky as well it's normal so i thought ah why not i'd get it and try it out for a solo game let's see how it goes i hope you guys enjoyed this if you do leave a like let's get into it here we go here's the boy one of them it's the growl it's not a particularly good build to be honest hmm that guy dropping in is this their loot maybe you're coming back together he's got to buy down there i think taste my gold oh mate you just put his load out yeah i'm gonna let you get that i look about there i know they're in a gym now and just had a fight oh there's a rock there i really want this kill i need to add more gold to my collection not pushed still at the rock i wonder can i get on this and [Music] then you got my head blown off there how about that [Music] there we go i don't know if that was the gun or the grenade that killed him there i think it was the gun look at this mad lad would you like me to paint your jeep gold i just want to paint it gold come back the most you guys even seen austin powers i don't know how well that movie's aged you're gonna pay for that gold yes i just love gold oh my god his head's off time to play check in you want to go let's go oh i actually took a lot of oh he's out no i'm just going to say your lower mate he's in mine okay this is awkward oh c4 that's fine what just happened give the old thumbs up oh dear i think he died so quickly because he must have taken a load of explosive damage from his own jeep exploding smoking a pancake there's a truck here and a guy trying to shoot it i'm got c4 though i've only got centex amazon that was not just didn't have the damage although i will try and get revenge because i've got a respawn where were we right down here is the truck still there [Music] you go on the left i don't see the truck is that it that must be a different guy what is going on there i think this is someone else he's got he's right there bad idea or someone in the building as well okay i like how this is a gold mp5 fits the theme of the video good and neither of those were the one that killed me he was called something i didn't manage to pick up any of the guns some gear all i've got is this uh mp5 but it's a pretty good build that just disappeared so it means there's someone in there right on the edge there's the revenge that's that roman guy car 98 scar you know what i reckon if this guy respawns it's going to come back so i'm going to put a cheeky c4 down right there give me a bit there we go dropping into the area watch the sky there he is got a present waiting for you mate the old thumbs up he's out of the game now surely he probably didn't have enough cash there hmm that's not good where are you i'm trying to get this jeep i'm a little bit screwed here to be honest no shot let's go there's still 20 other people in the game is it worth going for this guy nah probably not i'm gonna cop a c4 here there's a dude there i can't risk it because this is dead with one one c4 where did you go oh he's missed me he's right in the end i feel like i should go for this dude just for the memes okay there's a dude up the hill shooting at me maybe i shouldn't have done that what someone else you're kidding me no oh my god stop it how was that not a hit the sniper over there i'm just i'm just going no am i safe here i think i'm safe that dude is right behind me though he's got a good shot on him as well i'm just trying to get this load out there he is you have to lead way out can you just go away i just want to talk to you about gold you just keep shooting at me this dude wants me bad that's it where'd you go i found it someone else now a load of cash just went up in the air now i'm gonna get other somewhere in there get my load out quick it's golden that sucks look at this oh my god just waited for the loadout to disappear hey that was a fun game though oh look look someone's creeping on him come on i want to see this guy die yes that makes my day in conclusion it's gold then and i'm never using those blueprints again have a nice day okay take one mama what even am i
