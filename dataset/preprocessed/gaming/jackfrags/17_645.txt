hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're using the FAMAS in warzone it's arguably one of the worst guns for warzone but because I like pain I guess we're giving it a shot there are three matches here some really good firefights though here's how I had it built to be honest with you I've barely unlocked anything on it so I just threw whatever on but I wanted to test myself see if I could win a game and we had some fun here if you liked the video hit that like button below it's a great way to support what I do and enjoy some really sweaty Sunday PC European solo lobbies let's get it well everyone's going to superstore that's what I'm going someshit okay just went pro someone on the roof that's an early UAV right there no one on the roof and Cato every someone on the roof come this way come this way Molotov perfect let's go shoot me from over there now one bullet come on one more are you still there yes you are a bit rusty that was still lots of people down here in the store and lots of loped it seems right underneath they think that right there another one [Music] Oh slightly whitey slide eyd slide eyd just give me a harder you gonna come in come into my Dan of death and he'll come on you know you want to come in Brian I need to see you in my office get in here now Brian I know you're there to help poltergeist back Brian it's about your performance review I'll just have to go and see Brian then fine Brian what did I say there's more anyone else want to come and see me in my office anyone else this super store is horrible I hate everything about it I just rather it wasn't please vanishing oh you ain't see it murex he hates to see it I'm so sorry you had me dead to rise fully you absolutely had me dead to rights then don't know how I survived that one but whatever right where's the buy station up there that's what I want to go please just let me go yeah just let me go okay thanks I'm going to the buy station please just peace fire truce no one else shoots at me come on don't want this just want to get my father at all that's all I want please no body count this I think there's Thomas did I hear someone I feel like I heard something I didn't work all right they're going for their load up obviously and moving now I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep watching you buddy I'm going we go downstairs we leveled up so happy that was violent whatever happened come on got him okay I think the distraction of that goo like it's coming back actually helped me there I'm being tracked excellent come and get me oh okay this one's got a recon there would they go for that I think that would be so silly to go for that if they need money though maybe they would could be this guy coming over in the car yeah it just doesn't have the power like if you don't get that headshot you just don't get the kill straight away and that initial engagement like he had a chance to get some cover there I lost vision on that guy because when the glass broke it made like a big puff of smoke so in hindsight perhaps I should have smashed the glass so I know in huge year when I take a fight like that or I'm trying to set something go smash the glass beforehand we've got a long ways to run here and where was that from you can popped up on the meme up up there I don't really know if I want to take that fight to be honest don't think I'd do that Jeep is just driving around like mad I hear someone here down I'd go for the finish what why did it pop my shoes what the hell was that about I get the air strike how did anyone could be way again screwed this is one of the worst parts of solos when you're running in between buildings and you haven't got an idea of where people are any roof any building any window they could be there I feel comfortable now get you right there air strike too crowded actually beat that guy wasn't expecting that sniperscope unlocked what good did their an m4 and HDR I'm surprised I didn't expect to win that fight maybe we should give the farmers a bit more credit don't know it's difficult to use though I think it's bugged I can't use that killstreak anyone on the roof behind me down low maybe I don't know still too crowded you know dead silence I'm getting out there I don't know if he's going to climb up there to be honest and try and get for the finish but don't really want to stay to find out I think that guy had to grow as well just based on the time to kill was it you I finish you off yes I can okay that may not have been the guy that down me because I thought the guy that down me was on the roof unless he jumped off maybe they did still too crowded yeah it's boats all that building as well on the UAV it's not good and take this high ground and just follow the circle in as much as I can divert gas masks got it down him I'm done yeah I knew it I knew they'd be on that building with the growls or straighten the goo like oh we're lucky I thought I was done for then thought that was game over hopefully I can win this girl like empathy [Music] I think they just on my right for all patients patients from today okay load out down there I kind of need to get that don't I but I mean look at these routes I think that's my only play really take it slow someone down here he was fighting someone wasn't they but who was he fighting I don't know could have been shot from there you like it there I think that loadout is gonna be right on the gas on wondering should I leave it till I'm really really late last minute is that the play this Steve's got some sleep we'll just circle in come on you a be all right feel okay about this I need to go get the farmer so don't I ah shot from the roof with a growl oh my god dude so this game sometimes this game horrible never mind well hope you enjoyed that guy's I mean the pharmacy is it's okay I guess it's no where near competitive in the current meta though and I know I didn't have all the attachments unlock for it but shots yeah maybe it's not bad maybe you can be competitive with it but I just feel like the growl and mp5 at the moment is so good but if you're not taking them you're a massive disadvantage that's kind of sad but I know that there's a big weapon balance coming soon why does he stay hostile dropping into the area I know there's a hostile dropping into the area everyone is dropping into the area oh no no no no no no like four people on that roof oh right I'm gonna ignore that guy I'm gonna get this mp7 I didn't hear any gunshots there's some lights go let's go let's go good good good good good picking them off one by one beam as high as I can are they two people right what's going on here definitely someone in here gas masks I feel like there's someone else but I don't know where they are I bet this bounty he's gonna get that guy let's see oh no it's someone on the left and they've gone for that recon there okay let's get that load up you over someone right there dude that was so rude right where is it I must be yeah I called it that because it's probably going to get me killed oh man I've got there I've got the dismemberment rounds on it why have I done this to myself I don't even have the heartbeat sensor a burst rifle in war zone I'm sorry it shouldn't have been this way but it was I wish there was the same that meant you didn't have to confirm the buy you know I mean so you could just click it I know what I want to buy just let me click it I don't want to have to confirm it am I like dad I'm almost dead center at the circle here complete fluke though I don't mean to be am i dead if I go for this loadout and I see a guy down there [Music] yes we did it we've got another farmer skill I mean that could very well be someone in this building Oh a little fights going down down okay so the guys fighting should push and kill him please Alma broke does that an old claim all proximity mine maybe I bet that guy in the roof has no idea where he was shot from then there anyone on the train station yes son still some of the right sharing at me fire station maybe don't know put them in on green yeah it's green okay trying get a headshot I'm gonna heal oh come on come on come on yes thank you oh man I made a lot of noise there I don't know where the dude on the train stations gone quite like this roof now big fan 36 meters over here Oh in the bus so that guy doesn't have a head down is someone fighting over there no no I heard some gunshots over there I'm so lucky that I pulled out the baby monster then I'll go round this side that's an absolute mess there though isn't it I reckon I go around here [Applause] [Music] what are you doing I think I just assisted there okay gotta move quick reload oh it's terrible it's awful my GU leg no I was too busy sniping and he just crept up on me I almost have a dead though stone oh no no no you see other guy coming in contract there we go you know laughs on you go on RPG and whatever that is you gonna rush me broke now he's got a gun though I get closer I need to really pretend that I'm in the store I think that's the right above me I'm gonna go in now get a gun turn slam solos solos are so intense someone there I'm just going to fight that daunting they know I'm here going away switch come out oh okay there you go there's the thumb us get the stopping rounds in perfect and there was someone at this compound on the radar I'm gonna go after them because I feel like I've got an advantage with this stopping power let's say yeah there we go that was very very close like I thought you had had me - the rights then but unfortunately I think the stopping power saved me there I think if you get that head shot with this thing what the hell that dude just assumed I was still down there through the gasps oh but that was so lucky really oh my god where did you come from easiest kill in her life what we got kilo not bad I feel like the spices in the brush middle wall that grenade save my ass then oh cool literally just landed oh it's a nice get out that's in a really risky location there isn't it what is that spot oh there's someone outside that building right here did you have cash can I go for them I can't have to don't I it must just kill that person everyone went for that load out it seems I'm gonna move to the top I think there's a guy out there right there how was that another headshot down right now if there was someone above me they know I'm here now 100% so you know what I'm not gonna go up there anymore right there stand still come this guy's playing it smart though because he wasn't shot at I know that I can probably push this and be okay only 50 meters air 20 meters right in front of me what were you looking at just didn't hear me anyone else no I mean that loadout would be good for me and get ghosts that way no one behind me this is dangerous there yep why are you the way you are in the building never mind I hope you guys enjoyed by anyway that's good fun you know trying out a gun that I don't usually use in conclusion it's terrible don't use the Bombers without said if you did enjoy the video leave a like thank you and subscribe if you want to see more if you didn't like it dislike it
