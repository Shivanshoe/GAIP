hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to apex legends season six so there was a big update for the game today and i've not played in a while so i'm really looking forward to diving back in and really seeing everything that's changed on the surface the two biggest updates here are the new legend as you can see there's a big turret we're going to be testing that out seeing if that's any good we've also got a a new gun a new smg they've put the r99 in drops i think or they've vaulted it i'm not entirely sure but this is the new smg and it's called the vault it's an energy weapon it's got a couple of cool skins here as well so those are the headlines but there's been some really big meta changes as well the first one i guess is the change to the armor so now as far as i know you spawn with an evo armor and that's the one that you level up by doing damage that's quite a significant change and i think they've also decreased the overall health pool of the armor so the time to kill should be a bit quicker you can find as far as i know other levels of armor in loot still on on the maps but i think everyone starts with the evo armor so that's going to be a big really big change i think i don't know if you dropped with a gun yet i'm not sure like i said i haven't played in a while but there's also crafting materials as well again i haven't experienced that i wanted this to be first impressions of all the new stuff you guys can watch along and today i'm going to be playing with study and vikkstar i'm looking forward to it it's going to be good thank you for tuning in guys thank you for watching the stream the video and a big thanks to ea for sponsoring this one as well so with that said let's see if the guys are ready and we'll jump into a game hello oh here he is right do you want to do normal or ranked um i'm i don't know which is going to be uh more of a chill time for some apex casuals i'll do either i don't mind okay i reckon with it being like patch day i think just casual will be fine but we can switch the rank if we need to yeah we'll give casual a go if it turns out to be a tough one we can go rank the only thing that i know is a lot of people that grind up ranks when they get bored they go in casual um and then all the the big boys are in casual why if we like can't match with diamonds when we're playing ranked yeah that's true but we'll give it a go at normal and if it's seeming the yikers we'll switch it hey yikers the yikers this is a good vibe start have you looked at the patch notes yeah they've changed everything all the gun uh balance and stuff yeah gonna be interesting to see how it actually plays well i'm not going to get into being buying our 99 anymore yes that's true so we've based someone who gets it in the uh one of those drops although they did reduce the overall armor pool of health in there yes so everyone everyone starts with evil armor now we're ready for a bruising damn who shall i play um are you an octane main then stud octane is my guy he's my favorite oh sorry dude no that's fine i usually play um bangalore i played it so much i got a you know i wanted to try something new it's fine we're switching do you think that new character with a turret is going to be useful considering in most vr games the second you get on a turret you get headshot by a sniper you do you get the the shield as well right it doesn't have a shield though does it oh my standard i don't i don't think so but you can put shields up with that guy right something yeah yeah you can fit like three okay right man i just where should we go three all right away we go have you played any of this today vic not today i had meant to kind of jump on and reset my mind um from the world of other games but i didn't get around to it but you know what i've just i feel confident yeah we've got a squad we're a couple a couple couple gamers real gamers here real gamer hours we've got some true beamers yeah i i hope so yeah you can you still got the sliding memes you know yeah got myself an evo evo shield off the rip yeah oh so i thought that everyone started with evo's now but i'm wrong you still have to pick them you do you do you do because you yes if you shoot now and get 50 damage you'll instantly have an evil shield okay oh that's very interesting that's a big change yeah they've changed the whole meta i'm pretty sure yeah i just i just picked up a white evil shield so now i'm confused yeah so yeah or maybe maybe white shields don't exist anymore they're all evos i don't know that's right yeah but you can find gold armor gotcha extremely rare though and also it has less health than the fully decked out um evo anyway yeah um so we've got the new crafty metals so i'm collecting you just get those in in boxes it would appear on that one no idea what to do with those oh i just found a blue evo we take them to um like crafting stations and we can like um craft like i guess gear i i'd assume so let's be on the lookout for i think they're like replicated stations or something uh blue helmet here if anyone needs i just sound blue either yeah you can still find them but they're just all levers yeah they're all you know that makes sense because it was annoying like i remember like like when they just added evo shields it was like annoying having to pick up a non-evo shield she felt like you're a big disadvantage so i'm okay with it i don't know what my abilities are i probably should have checked um you've got shields you can put down and you've got a turret give it a test now yeah try it out let's have a look okay place cover so you can shoot through that but people can't shoot into the window yeah okay and you do additional damage through it as well by the way okay you could probably dance around it and like shoot people through it as they chase you um and my alt is um a turret sorry okay okay do i want to try this anyone can use that as well oh place a minigun okay i'm gonna save that i'm gonna save that for when we get in you can put multiple instances of it up vic i think it's three at once you can have ah okay a week you so all three of us could be on i think so yeah okay all right i think we need to go and find a fight yeah let's get some action did you get that blue helmet i hope [Music] i have to see it i'm in need of optics desperately sir if anyone find some some goodies let me know i wanna find one of these like crafting stations i think there's one a vic okay i just see something new on the map and i'm assuming that's it oh yeah yeah battery looking thing let's go investigate see what we have yeah there's something there oh there's a supply drop as well little drop thing oh you get three barriers not three turrets okay oh okay i just collected 25 from that no idea is it the hexagon down here maybe that thing there yeah oh wait no no i think starts what's this oh yeah okay i got my 25 as well i can't i got something i want what's that yeah come up here guys i'm i'm coming with you i got another treasure pack but i can't pick it up here we go this looks like it replicated oh yeah oh that is weird deposit your armor to level it with 100 evo points oh i've got 95 you can very easily be killed i suppose when you're in this yeah let's not spend the whole life in it okay mobile i've got 15 left so i'm deposited in workbench how do i get it back i've got no idea it's crap it takes time you know what people are just going to rock up on teams just here just printing your life yeah while it's uh crafting i've got the new volt smg which is um it's gonna be good to try yeah i'd like to find that i'll let you know if i find another mastiff the biggest loot goblins right now here here you go nice thank you have you already got one uh i've got a devotion for now was the new one they've updated it so it's out of the uh we just paid there was a blue evac shield here all along but i dropped something i don't know what i activated what oh i can tell what is that you've made a bridge i've made a bridge i think oh cool okay i'm so confused we're learning things okay we're not everyday apexes but i can't can you get an extended mag you can get an extended man for the smg oh it's i've got a i've got a oh wait it's a light mag is it wait so it's an extended energy mag yeah usually you need i'm i guess that must be a new thing i didn't know okay you got the ball now as well okay feels a little bit like the r9 just a bit slower if someone runs up on us close range it's going to be trouble for them like how we haven't seen a single person we're just shopping we're playing loot simulator right now shopping with jack stoddenville i got some more essence i kind of want to come back to the machine i feel like we should also probably level up our evo armor sooner rather than later yeah i feel like that would be a good idea because if we get to the end we've only got coming in for a blue replicator being delivered this is all so confusing replication so you can you can do a mobile replica wait i've just i've seen a um a drop over here there's a big battery there if anyone needs are we going out towards this drop then is it on the market so do i want an epic light mag no i need i need the extended energy mag pretty badly yeah sure this vault is going to be a fire team who already have it there you go this is just dry okay nice i ain't got the am i getting our 99 yeah you might get a gold armor stud i feel like this may be contested i don't know coming up it looks different it looks different this is like a the currency thing uh yeah oh is this a replica it's just another oh oh okay i just dropped in another i mean i got some more scraps i'm totally getting into one bang when you use this thing i don't think i want to put my armor in there ever again i'll be honest no i'm doing it now okay i'll protect you i'm gonna have to do it twice i think why what can i wrap your recycle yeah i got one at a time i don't have enough for that okay i'll have a purple oh god there's a guy here you guys mine okay i see him that is a weird sound okay i got my ebook get your shields up get the turret out oh yeah [Music] [Music] a little this guy's still down so these guys must have been too separate there you go no you have to sell presidents oh okay cool oh we killed the champions let's go nice oh the zone's here the zone's here guys i gotta go that was cool anything good in there um there was a bit of shielding that's about it oh wait this is aaron ain't playing games oh no here guys oh my god yeah i'm gonna have to go this oh my god we're ruined we're gonna have to go this way you have to go right now you can't get left you can't go left you have to go right yikes um i couldn't make it to the right now or um oh you can crawl around i can try oh you're like oh you've got a volcano hold on we can get him i need to see the heel first you've got two minutes yeah you've got two minutes yeah i just need to get a med kit i'll stay in this little pocket here if i met once we got one minute all right it's a great start isn't it you know what we're just getting everyone on the edge of their seats yeah i mean i'm in a little pocket yeah you're fine you're fine you're still out this pocket right here okay it's my little my little safe space in my safe place thank you i need to find energy ammo i have a decent bit i can lend you some all right thank you i'm missing an extended energy man i'm so bad at looting on this game like i'll be the first to admit it i'm just i just just doesn't work with me go back the way we came here yeah i'm gonna wait for my health to go back a little bit i opened that box i don't know what's in it maybe you can put your gun away do you run faster oh yeah um yeah you're right it's been a while it's been a while okay can i steal some energy i'm off you're very close yeah yeah one more minute uh wait wait let me drop it now exactly there you go thank you all right you only get 19 rounds in the standard mag um by the way my mini gun destroyed that guy that guy knew jack it took him from full health to nothing in a second you gotta yeah so if you see enemies spinning up with it what i notice is it has like a limited like left left right ability that's what we'll call it um turning space okay that's a circle or whatever yeah it makes it sound like a vehicle there isn't a vehicle we got uh shots out west hmm i yeah i badly need an extended energy meg i've got one already but if i find any more yeah we'll let you know it seems to have a lower bullet velocity as well than the r9 seems to travel slower i like the sound it makes um what's the blue thing over here going to investigate it's just like a little scrap deposit oh oh wait people ahead of me with volts i'm coming over here is a cool noise i want to get it on like on some height i might put it on top of this little uh rv here if i can climb up they've got the zone as well yeah yeah you want to go left or right i think they're getting from down right from behind them [Music] i'm doing a whole shield turret shenanigans oh even ready for she was only four now one of them's already down by the way they've got ready for girls i'm just one yet one drop down to the right you're having a good time there vic yeah mate i'm your character is just maniacally laughing there's uh there's like enemies there as well ricky armor [Music] hey he's got red evil watch out there's one on the right and yeah this guy in here's got red either although i could jump on my turret weight covering me on the turret there is just one clip there was one like lurking down there let me get on the minion if that someone else jump on the minigun you spin it off and you just oh the shield's gone vic oh it's not i was let's let's we're being held out here this guy here i'm actually destroying this show it's pretty good i'm running out did anyone have a sniper i did not need to use a whole shield battery then what was i doing finally got an extended mag oh yeah there might be one in these bodies right yeah there's another one there they might be pushing us yeah there's a yeah blue extended energy yeah i got it i got it nice people are calling their friend back over here this body here over here there's only three squads left we could go up here on top of this bridge and like go up here and we're in zone no one has a friend yeah yeah yeah [Music] i want to make sure no one's up here as well just coming in with this high ground an edge there you go south oh yeah yeah down right yeah we can maybe get this guy and we should do these shields maybe yeah you know what it's not a bad idea i've got a little bit down there they're fighting now last two squads i'm putting up some water and some cover for the boys broke him i need another weapon he's sick that you can shoot through that leg do you want to attack what they fight i i want to hold high ground okay i've got a bit by now right all right true yeah [Music] i dead how much does it actually amplify the damage yeah i don't know like what's the percentage the last team yeah last team's in there right yeah yeah oh they are in he's on the back side there yeah i'm just going to wait right there he really wants to do some damage to you yeah is it just this guy maybe i had two two yeah that's just way different there it cracked the shield again i see one inside i'm just putting up some shields on this hill in combat getting on the minigun hit him all right it doesn't work too good at that distance the shields are gone here one's leaving on the left one's uh exited out two out of the left so this is the whole team we're looking at yeah just gonna throw grenades out there hey three yeah he's pretty mad they have to come to us so let's go right down there got a new car i've nearly got a new turret on the zoo nice i feel like they gave us a grace period at the start just to go and explore yeah sleep leave your streams alone just let them show the new stuff you are the only champions they put up like a shield a shield around that's the shield area look it's not a lot of kills but dubs are dub it's battle royale wins the win exactly right okay cool that's nice first game are we gonna be right uh welcome to the stream guys thank you for coming along we gotta win on our first match i know there wasn't much action there until right at the end but like vic says it wins a win xavier said that cover boosts outgoing damage by 20 that's quite a significant amount isn't it but we did take a look at a few of the new stuff there this crafting thing is uh interesting it does rotations as well okay all right jack do you want do you want to do the new character and i'll do octane again whatever e player if you're on i don't mind it took about 10 years to reload that turret by the way vic i don't know if you actually experienced that turret bullets destroy doors no that's pretty cool yeah i'm the jump master could be worse could be someone else what's on jackpots is your channel name i don't know about that sayak i've got a brand and everything right where to uh um i've got to go somewhere a little busier well thermal station was where we went last time and it does it does have the hot drop uh is there anything new there's a few map changes i think like that bridge that was a new website launch site that's new surely it's rocket it looks like yeah yeah let's go back you know the massive rocket spacex god you've got jack thank you so we can just like go through the main door there i guess is that even a door yeah um let's find out looks like there's one team going like towards the main rocket more that door uh oh it kind of yeah you can get out there you can't go watch out there's one team that landed on the other side i'm just gonna go and try and find some guns over this way i've got a vault already nice mozambique here one down cool flat line though my line's apparently really good now i'm taking it that's the only convincing i need stud i've heard things i had weapons companies uh trying to purchase seals of approvals yeah could have something good here this pistol is great it was absolutely great yeah this area is new it's got to be yeah we've got a crafter here as well nice r301 the og um i've got skull piercer um for that if you want i want the r301 oh yeah i know what you mean select fire yeah that'll be the one yeah to be fair here's a longbow you know what it'd be rude not to get some snipes going on those vibes when you've won one game playing sweat and you're like okay let's just have a fun sniper game and it just we're gonna get rude what are you doing stud i'm building bridges can you stop he's connecting the people to the people creating new opportunities new six of gamepl legends that's right well i'm just gonna get some maps so i'm gonna do some farming yeah this hexagon thing where's the uh like construction thing uh right by you i found it yeah i'm gonna upgrade my armor uh where is it do you mean to leave this helmet here what was this hammer always here uh i think it was always there that way i still need 25 more evo points on this um have you gone to all the ones in the middle there's like one over there um i have not all right this is gonna be something to get used to leveling that armor up oh baby yeah i've got a care package coming in oh i still need more oh it's good that they disappear once you've used them i'm not fully farm you've got maximum match there's stud uh i've got 110. we've got to go the other way right yeah i'm sure there was a uh extended light mag somewhere a white one give me a shout if you see it where was it oh i just found a blue either i'm not paying top code my damn scammed scammed big scams uh can we get around this like are we going to get stuck again this way is there a route through there yeah yeah yeah you just go back basically all right should we go yeah yeah i'm gonna upgrade my armor along the way but i'll catch up i hope um there it is give me this army i'll have my uh support my lifeline supplier up soon as well so he can become even more looted yeah what's we got we got a lovely little medkit where's the where's the legendary i am hop up here oh yeah you walk like an old man stud when you don't have your gun out i don't like that here we go i'm bringing in the old care package has this been looted i don't think so for us i feel like everyone else is just hot dropping like he's getting yeah where's the hot drop though for this season i don't know oh um i've got a blue evo there's one thing upgraded starred i don't know if yours is i'm about yeah i'm one hit off okay nevermind gold map jeez now i'm gonna go and steal it all no i'm kidding i bags the i don't know i like you why is that should be a ledger there see if we can find uh the nearest one is that but are we going to lose there's a it park here this we could we could go check it out real quick all right got two minutes which way is it it's over that way take it if you want it i'm generous can we get there yeah we think these guys are yeah we'll be fine already going i think we have to do it though right we're properly goblins today is it here yeah it should be in that tunnel uh already opened yes yes it's here no it's not opened okay opened i see gold over you see as the uh volky holder well i mean yeah all the powers no you can help though you have that here we go i'll get the hat though oh there's a legendary one there or a gold epic this one okay oh phoenix i'll get the scraps it really do be scraps i can't lie there's a purple armor yeah why would i i guess it gets does anyone want to take it i'd rather take purple and have more health no purple's three as well so it's the same as purple but you have the puff peel yeah it's better you might as well take it yeah but then but then when you you guys get red you'll have four yeah that's the trade off though isn't it no it's not evil i don't think so oh that's the yes the trade off is you get the better stuff two times hog favor anyone needs right we gotta go and fight some people let's serve up the geyser again and try and find some yeah hit the boost you wanna you wanna boost up to the top man it's very quiet out here i think west would be the way maybe i know i feel like people will come from harvester yeah could be wrong i just want to get some kills for this turret that thing i would hate to run into that like at close range because i was using it at long range and it was destroying yeah hello anybody home it's a ghost town did i see someone over there maybe maybe not oops never mind be rude not to do some more looting while we're in the area okay troy i'm playing with vikkstar and study today scope just if anyone spots one oh there's people finding harvester they're all after that sunday dinner aren't they yeah you know i'm just gonna try and tag them and just level up my evo only pretty still get that joke on me snipes want them to show me we have to go kind of over there yeah do you want to go through this bridge tunnel yeah i'm loud here y'all feel so slow when i'm playing anything but octane yeah yeah big fat yeah bye bye have a great time that he doesn't see us let's get closer he's looking he's moving zips yeah let's get let's go let's go take that building or the one that he was on yeah yeah yeah i think so yeah all right let's build a fortress oh drop down i'm like they've added a double jump i think that was a couple patches that you guys there were jumping around who would you how did you get the double jump when you have one already yeah so if i put this here in this place am i actually behind there i'm on the way sorry guys i'm oh this busy cool oh i can shoot you this as well go over there okay we should watch the train kind of behind us back oh damn it right i have to jump to do this one dad get another one yeah there you go hey this is the fortress this is awesome can i move this oh yeah yeah we're good for now i think these guys are going to fight each other 15 damage i just want to farm damage from a distance [Music] just just farm up i imagine this is why it's it's so quiet for us on the edge of the map because everyone drops fast to try and level up their evo shields for late games yeah we're not really doing that sure there's nothing behind that two squads left again i love this place what the and one of them's down there so one unaccounted for squad what are they going to do we want to go for that drop behind us yeah tonight they're still here guys i think they're just going to avoid us they're just going to go straight right like east somewhere have you seen the other squad no wow we have no idea where they are i'm surprised they haven't pushed in our back um yeah i uh is this squad moving here they are but they've got they've got loads are they going to go for the drop in them hard okay yeah you run out of ammo or armor sorry yeah i'm watching this guy he's lit man yeah there's two below you guys one on the edge are you learning i'm coming through [Music] here yeah it happens it happened let's go again the uh longbow was not a very useful uh call when they all ran in on the attack so where's the hot drop so i guess whether where the ship starts i'd imagine yeah i just deployed the minigun and i was operating it and it took about 10 seconds before i could start to shoot but by the time that had happened i was dead maybe i should have put a shield in front of it first it's uh so it's a planned thing do you want to try the new one now stud i'm going to i'm going to nab okay so let's start jump on that study start the girl with the cold [Music] um everyone just said go to the blue circle if you want a hot drop how are we feeling about it yeah let's do it all right let's do it i'm the jump master could be worse right where is it i mean it's pretty far though it's over at overlook so i think harvest is going to be hot or train yard yeah i'm just going to try it yeah train yeah all right let's go straight in all right here we go oh yeah yeah everyone's going for this thing on the left here okay let's land training then rotate that yeah yeah good idea oh this is a one team train one team coming train yeah i see him oh boy he's right underneath me and he's got a gun i i have a mozambique lovely yeah all right yeah i got this one okay i'm actually gunned up now i'm coming he's ruining me from above can i go down here yeah he's not going on me i'm excited for another angle behind you yeah we've got people uh guys i'm pushing yeah that would be nice so you don't start i i was under the impression that you start with ero armor like everyone starts with that but you don't no no you think that would be better a bit more survivability at the start yeah would be nice because if you don't find one yeah instantly well especially now it's actually less survivable because most of the time you at least find white armor which is two right yeah no no it's nice yeah uh i'll try the new character there you go gopher i love a good party mate best way i'm gonna go for oh you do but you have to do 50 damage right level up to level one but that's not very useful if you've already lost your one thing of shield like you don't gain anything from that so you don't seem to have the icon there though right like the icon for the armor isn't there or am i just missing that you do yeah is there it is okay it just says 50 damage to get next evo level i mean this is going to be hot right this is a good house why are we thinking over there would you want to go to the lava on the left let me have a look i see one team looking to be going straight lava fisher we land on like this side of it yeah maybe the teams that land in the middle will all fight each other so it's a level zero evo yeah right oh yeah it's just down straight away oh snap he got a mastiff that's a little bit scary he's low-ish i'm at the door now okay he's still looking at the door you know that's nice yeah nice why did he oh we got a skin you lose that number one yeah champions out how the mighty have fallen have you got jack's banner yeah i got it now do we want to go in or is that off so someone we can go out uh let's go to let's go here that one yeah okay yeah should be able to get to that one i think yeah no worries yeah watch out there is fighting out that way um we can see it oh it's exactly on it's the view on where we need to get to how um we could we could pull back or we could try and third party i'm down to transfer party let's try and there you go broke him okay we could just go for yeah just go for the rest and then pull back i'll cover i'll cover how it shut let's go baby they've run away i think they're just recovering are there any guns around not really no one's moving where we were what about here oh this is luke a new vic yeah uh so actually that's right i'm starving ish there were i left cameras over here somewhere oh the shooting ninja sounds talk sir stop those guns there i think it's funny let's get all whatever this stuff is the scrap stuff here i'll even put us a uh all right i got absolutely annihilated there here i'm gonna put there we go out we go i don't have any shields i don't think i saw anyone land in this bit to the south so we can just jump in here and they're fighting somebody else now they're having fun as long as they're having fun yeah this town down here i didn't see anyone land here springs end okay um okay i guess someone did land here yeah okay people did land here yeah i've just got no shields hmm okay i ain't looking great there's not really a lot over here yeah i'm just looking for shields all i need there we go i found some they scanned me i'm probably rude i'm just running i'm coming i'll come up i'll come up you know i'm just gonna need to uh recover first recovering i see him one's close to me yeah hold on i don't have much ammo for my vic i've got i've got i've got a shot i've got mail put some things down stud some shields on the roof [Applause] i got one blowout yeah i've got no consumer balls they're pushing i think one is down do you have any heavy or sniper ammo stud uh i've got heavy can i rob some yeah yeah you've got any heels as well uh no no nothing we are a little ruined yeah we're dead all right let's see if we can get around to vic's body let's see if we can get around to the fixed body do the geyser yellow i do yeah i don't know i mean i'm not looking good i'm going for it yeah they're just going they're just hanging around just waiting for us to push hit the balloon and just fly in on them yeah yeah yeah yeah let's just do it i could put my hold down i guess oh no they're already weighing oh boy wait you po down oh i'm not a sniper ammo now change it's just guarding your body yeah that's what you're doing i see that that was a good frag i kind of feel like the respawn shouldn't time out yeah sometimes well let's just just send it jack come up are they being beamed they're being beaten down this is waiting all right see if i can get the body yeah if you go on the roof i was out of the terrible room i was at the top of that staircase six seconds i'm ruined i'll never make it three seconds it's everything oh no they've just gone into ourselves descended yes are they in that building so right there in front of me let's go i mean i don't know either way right like we're dead oh oh yeah okay all right you know what we're gonna go on style no um that was a little more unfortunate all right stay ranked the only logical expression yeah i'm down though i'm down look at us we are bronze so from couple bronze legends let's get it i am actually bronze four it says on bronze one but that's a lie hmm i'm bronze for living my best life that was an absolute budget round that's the most budget round they've ever played you can uh grab round pair if you want all okay do you think do you think what we should do is like hold like a building and just put it in there and then when they run through the door you just annihilate them i like just putting it on like the top of a hill right with the shield and you but you have to kind of like put it down and wait like if you're putting it down to directly try and challenge i feel like by the time you spun it up yeah yeah all right we're coming you can spin it up with the right click you know yeah i'm gonna take off the sorting factor if you guys are about it yeah let's go yeah far side of sorting factory it's just i know that spot that was my season five go-to back when i could play as uh players pathfinder simpler times nine second grapple yeah i don't know about that dropping on fools okay um do you want to just spread around here yeah yeah i'm just thinking that you made the building someone's already gone in there yeah there's a team that made the buildings already i hear them next to me where the guns are down the roof here come over the roof i've got nothing left jack dude i just got my i've got a frag grenade that's it let's go there's people just looking underneath this fish yeah just getting stronger and stronger the longer we leave it let's go for it let's go over here to the rocket meme i'm down i'm down i'm down time to our humble humble beginnings all right two grenades in a scope let's go yo you can throw the scope on wait i'd love to imagine if you could just chuck stuff at your inventory 10 damage just throw it take your helmet off yeah i have a gun let's go let's go baby oh uh there's a thing up there yeah i'm going for that oh [Music] now i'm living good let me back adam let me back adam met my re45 how has this happened wow alternator finally dude i've gone up to near as well yeah alternator only challenge guys why not oh that's uh i think that's the purple body armor just down the way oh i see it he's running faster than the one a blue kind of blue very nice i hear i hear people in front of me okay in this building here yeah yeah i'm going around the side full send is it i mean but you got it he's got gold armor and a shotgun didn't mean he's very low right there he's gone west i think hiding behind this maybe i don't know i don't know where he's gone is he still in the smoke rings you guys okay with that oh yeah we're good nice okay good stuff okay two gold armors one purple this is good this is progress 10 seconds gonna get a carbine and a volt smg i think it's the uh the loadout of choice for today [Laughter] five i've completely forgot about the harvesting stuff like the resources yes but i upgraded gold shield then i don't know i don't know yeah i'm gonna try i've got i've got health and shields now this is nice oh wait the gold i've got is an evo i guess another gold doesn't you can't level up that's the problem i see stuck at three at least you can heal better at least i have that going for me i guess i'll just go and get a uh got myself a digital threat for the old vault and that's a fast reload spitfire i'ma get me a digi threat for the vault yeah i'm getting one as well great minds think alright [Music] get mobile respawn beacons as well from this if you've got enough resources oh yeah yeah we should probably do that yeah i'm getting one it's not worth doing oh yeah i think so but it just makes a one here right um it just means you can respawn someone wherever oh i see wherever you are i see it's an inventor i didn't realize how it worked wait can you get a shield here i can get med kits that's not very useful wanna move out yeah yeah i've just shot down a a golden ball look at you this has already been laid this game needs skateboards yeah yeah that'd be cool would be very cool actually you could grind all the rails get some points grind this rock right in that rock that's it oh have you got the all still vic or whoever had that was it [Laughter] that's gonna be me when i end up in the zone oh no first fight we get into guys watch me watch me grind this right really i don't know like guys the zone's coming at a pace oh i do think the zones uh it's not a friend today nope oh volky do we want that yeah defoe where's the gold ball gone got it i just uh oh you smashed it yeah smashed it no that's fine uh well the only vault is there and that's gone so rip ah some big biggest of rips that's a i think they call that one a fat rip let's go harvester see what's up see what's happening actually yeah imagine a legend do you have a skateboard and they can use it as long as they're not taking damage and as soon as they take damage they have to get off again that's it man hire this man now get me in there respawn get start on [Music] out yeah [Music] broke armor jeez someone else was shooting at him i think there's more in here yeah there's one by the like caravan thing down below i'm gonna talk with you bro one here team on our left close to us yeah close that very low let's hold on one left one the last one i think was the guy floating away behind on the bridge yeah i'm gonna climb up there different oh this guy had everything i could possibly want now we're talking now we got guns one more minute amigos rings right there so close charging my shield all right i'm liking the loadout let's get moving any goodies over here why do i have so many med kits i have seven med kits how's this happened eat a heavy ammo if you guys find some i'll look out for you for 30 seconds please i have too many space in my backpack i don't know what i want anymore too much choice i am confused all right uh you know i might go and upgrade my armor inside here i kind of i kind 27 for my next one so let's do it let's do it yeah do we have time i think yeah yeah yeah because it's a late zone it's pretty quick they slow this slide i don't think so it's probably your character she's not very fast oh yeah white tom is creating here team here oh guys that's what you're doing great give me new life there's a treasure box there guys yeah i've got mine oh it's gonna be faster gonna be faster all right we're good we go are we gonna be good i can put a jump back down here yeah that'd be sweet a little more all right i'm going to go up to the right here i'm going to cut here pink ruined wait is this hot this is hot this is very hot this is very hot i've made i've made a mistake you're in the lava i'm cooking it's okay it was worth it recovering he's one of my many many med kits there's there's another machine over here i want to get my uh gold if you guys don't mind yes do it i can't believe we literally caught it [Laughter] they were probably sat there like oh we're out of the circle no one will come here let's just get our armor and get out it's a bit of a commitment isn't it like it is scary i'm crafting a respawn beacon if anyone wants it what am i crafting uh ammo i can hold it yeah i've got the ammo this is cool i quite like it it's like a big risk reward thing what's that a mobile record yeah pick that up if you've got space i got spacer for newbie i got it all right let's move um which way do we want to go into zone i think probably this way tunnel okay um i don't know i'm scared i'm just getting some more ammo just buy some more ammo there is a drop this way we go east i'm good i mean our loadouts are pretty i think we're pretty snappy let's go i think this goes downhill into the circle as well which i'm keying for one minute things close plenty of time to jam have you got enough heavy ammo stud um i can do i can do it more definitely i'll i'm just looking out for it for you for finding thank you up here what we're thinking best fighting in that tunnel he feels weird he's my guy do you want to go and wait for all these guys to come out of the tunnel into a train i just got scanned yeah right here okay yeah he's got a team we pushing this i'm about it one low as hell there can't see him jacob over here watch out maybe let's not shout this though a little bit i need help yeah i'm coming down um jack here's the thing oh thank you thank you being shot in the back as well we can back up a decent little bear that's a bad position isn't it they know we're under here yeah it's dog you can open that car back on the way if you want yeah i'll cover it away [Music] i broke his arm a bit he's got dudes one of them's heating you've got one respawn beacon vic um yes i'm gonna try and get around to your banners i'm gonna try and loop around do you need the banners to use that recently give it a break this is why i wish i was octane get out of there vic running away from people is so hard on this game when they know what they're doing also they've got the speed thing because these guys are only on i think [Music] oh oh my god admittedly the low ground there was not the place to be but i don't think running into that squad any which way would have been the way you know what um we shouldn't actually play ranked because apparently everyone got reset so everyone yeah diamond players will be playing in bronze right now so yeah i think this normal q will be the wave yeah let's go are they adding um they're adding cross platform to this as well aren't they i've i do not know all right hmm yes i'm gonna i would like to be octane so i can run away forever as ever we got this round squared away i read somewhere that bangalore's real name is anita oh it doesn't really fit does it no not really introducing your champion you know what i look like i feel like she's an angie and angie because he's angry oh she's angry all the time this is a magazine okay um we where we wanted to go uh count down the spot and if we died countdown yeah sure count down but it's on the streets [Applause] these guys got the same idea oh yeah then the reason we lost that game is because vic didn't spam the minecraft sound oh yeah we got here with the you know what no one's going to train do you guys want to go train just so we can get looted up and get a third party yeah train you on there's not yeah there's not a person in train i'm just thinking it's a good loot spot true and then we go down that way and we just take everything for everything they looted anyway easy oh there's um one of these lads have you got a gun um not that it shoots that far blue evo nice nice there's none of that blue stuff around here though that's one that i've noticed so that's maybe why no one dropped here can't get any of those upgrades going i don't see anything there's some stuff upstairs let's see if we can grab that i have a pistol oh good good and they made weapons rare or something two mozambits yeah no it's looking sleepy for a loo i must say you go with that ball hit it it's running i don't know if i got it deeper it's just purple stuff in there it's weird some alien pollen come on go go got it you're beaming someone the uh thing oh yeah the the golden ball the big ball all right i'll see if i can oh there's there's someone who's uh pills over there all right let's do yeah the it petals in the air make me think there's a purple armor in the distance jack it does look like that debate higher level mate got an evo shield here level two yeah i'll take that oh nice one minute rings nearby okay this is lyric they're doing the bridge they take it they're taking their jobs what are you gonna do about that what am i doing they're building it and countdown all those guys they're doing some sort of construction i should come over to skyhook and join you guys i was ready to fight at um ah it's so quiet there's no one here yeah they're all in there countdown we have to go back the way we came don't we yeah should we just go just go out to vic then yeah there's some looted things here i mean i can come through we can loot for a bit all right it was zen moving i don't know what kind of speed this there's a floaty drone there give me a shout out if you find that energy thing again uh shield vic yeah okay got it okay that's not bad that's good gear package touching down extended mags to the wings oh i'm looking for a skull piercer as well if you find one we've got a new kill leader try and get them headshots right i'm already heading up now you want to get out yeah yeah yeah i think it's better to move early west on the way i hope you enjoyed the stream guys thank you for coming along again it's weird getting back into apex soon as i haven't played it in such a long time hopefully we can win this one oh i use my oh he's getting shot by people in town do we want a gate keep all of these all right there's people still right as well yeah let's let's let's just wait on this armor we can turn these guys all into the filling i'd love to we'll be the outside of the [Laughter] sausages can i use my minigun somehow definitely stay up on like this tall building here they've just they're thrown from here i think they missed the nade actually i'm going off on top of here he's got a snipe is he on top of the building there yeah yeah yeah absolutely roomy yeah i came on top of that but they have to move so i might just lie low they push me i'm i'm deemed you're dead me i did i'm sorry they got their own problems inside that building i can't lie one just jumped really high team the other team found me i got your back i think they're not pushing me though they're not pushing me i'm christine now they're pretty now all right boys oh my goodness just i've just launched myself into the gas wow yo that gas hurts one ah it's all right jack i might be able to launch myself to you can you say you know there's people in this building there's people in this building they're recovering inside the building give me a second there's people on the outside as well though to you is it a whole squad they ain't playing games wow we started off uh we started off well now we're getting stomps on all right we go again absolutely too bad our armor was uh pretty pretty weak by that point that's what we'll say that's what we'll say blame the armor yes i just need you to ready up start oh there we go you know it's crazy i still don't have any hourly margins on this game no i don't think i do either i've opened so many a3 accidents how did this accident occur then where was i to be fair to be bad i just i just got real lucky must be nice all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna did you get to use the turret stud i did not i was dead before this game i'm gonna use the turret and get a kill let's go three kills all i need to know is does tim the tatterman have a win on four guys yeah does he ever win yet um i know what i can count down's going to be busy surely yeah i think it will be i know i'm thinking about it again training out again the loop there was a pit yeah it's a bit count down countdown let's go we've got to have some confidence you know we've got to go you know let's level up that ride or die you know oh my nice and early i think we might have the right or die attitude just get in there get killed straight away our team landed on like the quad hill set up right over there that's their three there up and down nice any more here stud i don't know i haven't seen anymore there goes the champion there should be some good luck here jack you want to take that spitfire character they're building a bridge to me i'm running away this is what i'm talking about they're building a bridge i think they're trying to rotate around that side a sound man need fresh armor again yeah i don't have any armor there's another full squad lurking around there somewhere there's a ball back here a ball i see him still there like that they're over there you completely wiped one of their dudes i don't think he was one of their dudes [Music] they're running over here they're pushing me i think yeah i'm getting out of here where are they just on the other side of the building like over there a big beam yeah is there white or there's white armor there oh i think that starts though i think it's broken get away should we just here they can they definitely heard us but they're fighting the fight not me they're fighting me what's low okay on vic one one down pathfinder [Music] somehow we made it for now so long health watch one shot attention i've got a steel back for you vic if you need it yes please oh i just got purple nice anyone got heavy ammo uh i'm dropping a little light over here no you don't i don't want to take that sniper jacks it's the no one uses it there's no one that costs shields to take shields yeah yeah i suppose you put me off now stud no it's just like longbow is just way better that's all oh look at that so this time there's uh metal scraps here but there wasn't last time yeah just i guess it just moves around every game like the hot drop no matic i think the map needs more players potentially but then when you get like pushed by a couple teams there's so much survivability right yeah just feels like the mid game is really slow at the moment [Music] can i go again don't even have points good guys look i never mind heavy ammo okay i got some too i can only reload once though ah all right again i think i should be able to get gold armor or red even i hate the uh hollow scope on this game i just hate the way it looks hectic life cool um you upgrading unbelievable can i do it again i can surely not again no i don't know stuff button not far off the red i have no shield um batteries or anything i can drive you one dick if you want if you can upgrade your armor multiple times it should just let you do it rather than having to do it again and again and again yeah so once that twice it just goes yesterday upgrade three times for the next one [Music] don't know why i'm like the helmet um okay what now [Music] is pushing don't see any lads or losses yeah i see a lot from up here thinking around the side well this way yeah just so we don't get caught by are you going that way okay i think we might get caught by people coming from harvester a bit of loot out this way as well yes the hitchcock classic i'll never get over the fact that octane just runs with like a gun finger out held to the sky oh wait a minute on to this ready oh trick shotting [Music] that's where we died last time yeah do it again it's too quiet yeah this doesn't oh wait people crafting at the thing they had at the shop ahead they're making their armor now no they've just oh i don't have any utilities my problem here i think they saw me yeah yikes hmm well i've got a new launch pad i'll come back in try and grab your things oh no [Music] and there's his friends unlucky we were so happy with ourselves for third partying and then we got that party this game is tough yeah it is it's the whole like movement survivability like i struggle like with the movement on this game i'm not i'm not super fluent it's like getting that balance of like when to run when to like shield back up when to uh do all that good stuff that is when it becomes tough thank you thanks it is tough isn't it guys we've got a couple of kills but then we just got third partied right out of the squad difficult man the f3 remaster soon alefarias i don't think so ain't nothing better than waiting except for bloody everything else what's up farooka how are you doing hey jamie introducing your champion gonna play with it two times now that he can't play with any twitch streamers maybe sam i'm the jump master i don't know if i should be the guy to ask though hey travis i'm doing good thanks what's up yeah it is a net logic right yeah um i want to go starting factory okay a little bit got some not good um this is like that's just one team isn't it let's start down here holes on fleek noise got myself a little yeah i think that's a good thing you want to get another good idea and i gotta fight now i'm about it um get out go back pull back there's a balloon all right i'm getting on the balloon getting the balloon it's nazi now we're getting it now we're getting apex just run away until you've got the best gear look till you get a vault key the rest is history brad how do you become a member to the channel so in the

as many like fully deck loadouts until we've had like proper fights yeah yeah do they still have things do they have the guns that you can pick up with all the attachments anymore i feel like i haven't seen any of those today are the gold balls you have to go you have to go to the hot drop area to get it oh okay not today not today are you in there yeah no no no no i don't feel satisfied with my loot i feel like you got a really bad deal there yeah should we go back through this little town out here um yeah i guess so yeah just getting some more later my gun situation leaves uh a lot to be desired ten seconds rings close we got this so i don't know if this resource stuff is like if another team gets it just go can anyone get it i think anyone can get it because when we like get it um multiple times like it just stays you know i assume it's the same for other players blue helmet here [Applause] slow but it's got serious stopping power [Applause] take that one miss the old thing here xavier brad thank you thank you for becoming members appreciate that sorry ignore that powerful there you go i'm going to go and hit the crafting station get some upgrades i think i found yeah by the way they've updated so that if you switch um attachments will automatically go to the other weapons they can go on yeah this does take a while if you've got a lot of uh points to put in [Music] a little annoying [Music] ammo yeah it takes ages yeah [Music] but i don't have enough now i need 300 little booster here to get us on our way making a skull called piercer eric thanks for the five uh

fortress in here what what do you mean are you good that's fine one destroying all that stuff yeah and ruining their game what's that big strat you're gonna have to move in my speed to make the next ring which way do you want to go yeah this one you really could just spend your whole game just running around picking these up yeah i'm sure that's what people do when they when they got nothing going on definitely wasn't min maxing we hitting the shop again as well right in the middle so we don't even lose too much time man jack would be we'd be crafting you got it i need five more i can max it i'm like well it's the way i can do it for you i don't think so there's that one in the gas there [Applause] all right let's let's hit the road let's try and kill the team it will do some damage at least let's try and kill a team that's my size start small let's fire a few bullets and then die that's the reality a hazy lady thank you for becoming a member hey damian you've been a fan since the only in battlefield video cool thanks yeah that was a long time ago that's 20 2011 2012 i think a minute sticking if we aiming to live then let's not foul it up there those for days i'm going to need them with this gold i you know everybody hooked me up with one i'll give you a phoenix cat one okay oh yeah i have good trades for you my friend one day only for this offer i i can't use phoenix kids because they're pointless he's living living good out here in fact big big shows are basically useless for me what could you put on the small one so fast yeah i don't know if gold's worth it at all to be honest it just doesn't seem that the benefits just don't seem that good at still ring all let's go let's go let's go i still need an extended clip for my uh butterfly guns just not looking oh is that one yep nice oh hey mastiff's over here i have like a small amount these damn treasure packs i need a bigger backpack actually oh wow there we go click the old one like there we go another team just went i think they're over here somewhere that's what i heard you have to go you gotta go there you go legendary yes please oh this is we're gonna move we're gonna move are you taking cheers sounds like there's people outside the zone as well okay all right like they're probably out here east should we run through the cave power i don't know actually i'm i'm easy either way you'll get stuck outside now i think if you don't get a cave [Music] oh someone's getting a replica replicator dropping like it's hot okay then the last two things to find we're gonna go okay you gotta get there are they for them right is that what it sounds yeah they're naughty before this way yeah can we make somebody come back like a little third party on the they're still fighting outside the zone yeah come on give us this one come on they've got someone down they got someone down come on come on raise our 99 beams for our egos come on i'm just gonna throw grenades at them where are they they must be over here somewhere are they even further away than i think they must be like over here i'm going up there i'll go and scout from the top of this hill i don't see anyone like this is where i heard the shots i heard the shots out here i've got i'm reconning from above i still i just heard another shot over here you know i need to go in on this i'm going in vic is going in i'm going in pull back if you need to pull back if you need to you think i'm baiting he's low he's those one shot i just want to use my turret i'm putting nades up there the other spot behind us watch out one's low he's low

beam the you are pushing behind me now okay evil shield bro karma big recovery recovery um i'm so screwed that was a bit of a nutty ending we didn't get any kills oh my god oh dude we're going to third party and what happened we get dropped cheese oh my goodness champions oh man i'm i'm gonna call it there boy that was that was good we started off we started off with a big dub and that's what that was that was the problem yeah i left it you just threw us in with the sweats yeah all right well gg's voice was fun playing yeah yeah see you later good games damn i mean this is this is tough apex is tough at least we did get a lot of uh time to see the the new stuff though i'm not sure about that turret i don't know how effective it's going to be because you're such a sitting duck when you're on it i try i put quite a bit of damage down there on that pathfinder that was at the rocks and the bloodhound as well but just not enough to down them and i was being flanked as well at the same time but the crafting stuff is interesting too new guns kind of cool that vault smg i just feel like it needs more players you know like that mid game can be so slow at times or maybe the map needs to be a bit smaller but there we go thank you for watching guys we did get one win right at the start a couple of interesting fire fights as well a big thanks again to ea for sponsoring this one
