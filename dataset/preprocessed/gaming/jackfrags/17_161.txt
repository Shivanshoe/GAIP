what do you think of caldera versus vedansk i'm i'm leaning more towards caldera but overall in terms of design or it's about a royale map as a actual like for fighting and trying to be the last person standing yeah i mean i really like it i just wish some of the trees were thicker and i kind of wish that peace wasn't so central because i find that you spend so many matches just running uphill all the time when you get close to peak as well like some of the rocks being completely un traversable like you just can't climb up them yeah it's not it's not great it's fun though i'm just glad to have something new you know don't get me wrong like verdansk as a as a br mat was was good i really enjoyed it like really different why a minute this yeah completely different makes me wonder where they'll where they'll go next because like they've done the classic like urban battle royale and now they've done the classic jungle battle royale well the rumors are that the next game is like uh favela like mexican cartel drug lords that kind of thing so it could be desert yeah that's a good shout like do you remember ghost recon wildlands they had like loads of biomes so it had like a little bit of jungle a bit of like was like the salt flats i think as well they had that would be amazing i'd love it 200 meters of open salt flat and your loadouts the other side of it okay so the good news is i'm alive the bad news is they're still alive try to land on you you can come here yeah i mean there's uh a gun a cooper carbine give me some ars ar rounds uh there's an ammo thing out there i'll switch they'll definitely be in this building in front of us i think the tower boy okay i would like to kill them he's in the tube yeah nice he was hanging from the uh the ceiling nice oh you're over here oh no okay i've got snowballs why have i got snowballs he's uh first floor on the little a little bit up top on the side yeah he's quite far back i can't i haven't got an angle [Applause] and peek him again he's still out there he's still peeking can i take this off he hears you you could take the repel but he's below me now yeah he's below you he's on that he's on the level down from your tail nice one jack that's close i'll go and get me loadout i've gone for an amax for old time's sake oh nice rolling back the years or the year my donnie darko swiss anyone here surely oh where's he going on the radar in between the two big buildings okay i didn't see that at all and we dropping in didn't get that cool either what i didn't i didn't get that at all i hit him with a stun [Applause] so good double threat textbook attack that was they on the mini map for you they didn't pop up for me at all one of them fired a shot when they were like here like they were just over here and they fired a shot and they popped up for a split second ah silly billy i mean i would like to do the tree but i've got a feeling it's going to attract some attention it's fine i mean you know i want my presents actually no if we do the tree krampus might find us oh god that's true you're just invisible again jack you're just a head good just a head oh there you go i wonder if that's the same for other players as well am i invisible to other people i mean within 30 meters you're visible and then yeah after 34 meters jack you disappear i'm gone yeah you're gone good yeah you've just you're just ahead and a couple of guns it's the tier 100 skin so pay to win yeah nothing there that looks like a cobra it always catches me out see that plant there oh yeah [Applause] thermites work on him by the way oh good oh look he teleported the thermite yeah you can turn my oh so easy okay oh because we're only in duo so his health's gonna have been reduced oh does it scale yeah i think it does got a precision a plate box okay you can't cramp slide in the water no but you get cold blooded if you crouch in it i think yeah uh uav let's see what's going on a couple of men went towards them

to go yeah just gonna go over here move it can i hold him see if we can first floor here let's move come let's move get position gonna get up the hill to one of these houses like there's definitely gonna be someone in that surely yeah there is someone right outside it i just saw him scoping it out good bean i've got two stuns hand behind us lying still still fighting behind nice stay on the edge of the gap [Applause] nice jack there's more of me left [Applause] nice there's one more there's one more what he's on the mini-map you can see him we're gonna get shot from up here if we're not

good point it's 2v2vt let's let him fight we can't i mean we've got the power play for them to stumble us though and push there you go there's the shots there's the shots they're over here our only our real play is if we wanted to push south south east and flank right round but there's i don't know if there's any point moving yet why is he shooting like that though i don't like his weird i feel like he's baiting yeah i feel like he knows where i think they're still down the hill here jack i think this i think they're down here i think they're down here really is that someone no yep sniper north out the window looking at you or not nice where is he i can air strike it he was here he was here [Applause] nothing oh nice nice nice i feel like i'm worried about the team uphill though yeah me too i'm really worried about team uphill i feel like they could actually just take the house and then they could come down onto us we're in here you're losing ground moving reloading okay keeping an eye out down below we're gonna be on heartbeats as well i think i [Applause] it was a great game really enjoyed that one krampus can't stop us this time cameron thank god we finally got a game where he didn't kill us that was fun i enjoyed that yeah i think because we got krampus quite early on he didn't annoy us later on yeah just wish it wasn't in the main mode just put it in an ltm ggs
