hi everyone hope you're doing well today i've got some action-packed warzone games with aculite playing duos and really starting to love this game though but we just have a great chemistry together and seem to play really well with each other so i hope you guys like this also something i think related to the new call of duty game turned up on my doorstep today and i'm not really sure what to make of it but i'll show you anyway this weird looking thing here it's a bolex 160 camera from the 1970s so you would have used this to shoot home movies back in the day and hidden inside the film compartment there was a note with some instructions and some redacted information a cipher square and a usb drive so i loaded the usb on my pc and it's a file that opens up a dos box that asks me for an access code so i went back to the letter read that and used the hints on it to decode the polybius cipher and that gave me the passcode of shortfall so i entered that into the dos box and it opened up terminal 1 which kind of looks similar to that weird cold war website now at the bottom of the letter there is a load signal r436 so i entered that into the terminal and then this image came up on the screen it's a pot of gold spilled over and it says the pieces are in play now what to do next i have absolutely no idea i've not been given any further instructions at the moment i'm guessing this is some kind of arg so if you've got any clues or suggestions do let me know down in the comments below and before we get into the game i just wanted to say a huge thank you to all of these fine people who've used my supporter creator code in the cod store if you enter jackfrags in capital letters and buy something from the cod store i'll get a bit of kickback from that so a massive thank you and as always if you do go ahead and do this take a picture screenshot it whatever tweet me the picture and i will include it in a video like this one and so on to the games with acolyte his channel is linked down in the description below if you want to check him out but i think you'll really enjoy this there's some incredibly tense and tactical moments in these two matches and if you like it leave a like let's drop in now and see how we got on four second places man it's gotta be a record i'm telling you we could yeah you wanna do super maybe it's glitched and we just get loads of money yeah and then we just run over to the buy station buying reload let's do it where's that oh why are they after you yeah i'm almost dead right let's not go super there's like the whole servers there please dude this guy is still after you he's still chasing still chasing me slows you right i was gonna go mail him for you all right jack hit it we did it i think this is the closest one that's fine

the buy but um oh he just called him back he's going for his loot old here they are you wanna shoot them yeah broke the first round seconds lit one dead is it the rock still i think can't match i'm going to try pushing up here a little bit just because i don't have anything reloading he's running away it's behind the shack okay he's getting shot from uphill in the building i'm going this way he's gone in there and there's another team in the building to your right we are not in a great position nope okay okay well i grabbed the other guy's gun but this is terrible dude you're absolutely right great it's not great i have any sniper ammo either are they pushing no no he's just holding it there's literally nothing we can do hmm um a little bit of a predicament there's a repellent damn isn't there we can get up to the top yeah at the very back yeah underneath we can't get to that if there's someone waiting at the top of the damn i'm going to go crazy i'm not gonna lie i thought i heard a footstep i don't know what i'm hearing it's just ambient noise it might be yeah okay good luck ah i'm dead it's fine it's fine no no you're fine yeah there is like an ambient footstep noise like i don't know if it's like water dropping or something but it sounds like all the sounds are roughly the same that's what it is nothing a heartbeat into the area he dropped it on yellow station he's got the healer this guy's got eod up top in this building hold on crosstank yeah i'm gonna wait for it no tag he's got a shotgun did he jump he jumped out i think back in me bought him dead thank you oh my goodness that's so scary going up against an original i literally peeked he was prone with the shark and just looking at me he's outside bottom floor broke him oh my god he knew exactly where it was the other one i don't think crossed yet nice jack look at him go save my life then oh did you stun him yeah there's someone out here in the gas was that a decoy could have been do you need place yeah no i think there's someone here connor you think there are actually somebody there i think i had a footstep yeah he's in the tower place oh you can buy some as well yeah i'll buy some extra why is he in the tower um oh i can't really look that far up can i just throw semtex up there does that work yeah that'll make it probably won't kill him but oh god that didn't work the second one didn't work with a king up here with us gas he's on the roof oh my goodness i'm gonna get knocked dude i can't see anything with that gas i know don't worry about me just keep going just run and parachute off why is there so many people up here it's all up to you now there's like three or four teams up here do i have options to buy it um there's one but i wouldn't even worry about me there's a guy in your building i can hear him i think he just dropped in he's got to go for the loot really well done i think there's like a cluster strike or something on that one guys oh yeah there is i mean there is a buy if i could get to it i think there's cash down here as well you got six other people in game wow tons of cash [Applause] i wouldn't worry too much about me jack [Applause] someone else shoot that guy please i'm getting pinged here i think connor yeah go downhill if you can maybe cluster him i don't know you got this oh man this really sucks you might want to check right behind you like uh down low ice side i don't know if there's people down there but there's i can't still like yeah there's still a lot of teams left it's got really bomb cover could hit that wall okay one less team three others yeah i just saw him draw finish them off maybe if you can oh wait 1v1 well the other guy died just how the circle comes to me yeah that's rough of course he knows where i am as well you've got it there it is jack there it is see you didn't even need me wow well done that was great you headshotted that guy through the down guy and i think it broke his armor yeah that's wild yeah that was a really good game man that's a solid match so we've got four second places and one win and one win yep we really fought for it too think about the positions that we were in for that one yes tough solid match that import is absolutely disgusting i love it you like it yeah it's very good yeah i like that ads speed i don't know that paired with like a sniper it's just it's nice socially distant halloween this year socially i actually saw a picture some guy had like his front door he's got a tube set up from his front door to like the end of his driveway or whatever so from his front porch he's just going to slide candy into the ball at the end to be fair he'll probably have the most popular house if he's got a shoot that delivers sweets into your hands yeah exactly he's right next to you connor oh that's going to be messy his friend's coming in behind right above me now he's running okay i'm going to try to get out down and killed off the teammate though yeah he's a buff i think yes nice he wasn't too happy that i just mailed him in the back did he scream uh not necessarily a scream he's a vulgar language uh you know kids these days kids these days oh no he's broken wow how low was he jack like one hp i hit him like two times man sorry i was a little slower no that's okay i didn't think he was hiding in the corner i only have a car 98 in the pistol oh they're doing a recon that should be bottom level i think one down okay come from the other side broke his armor keep going keep going nice bait that was just quick scoping them there well played oh my good i have a stun no hit him requesting flyover dude i'm gonna send him well i played okay i don't think he's friends here i don't think he has self oh that might be his friend actually his buddies in yellow moving here all right i'm gonna give him the old uh dog old razzle dazzle right on the other side dude here oh yeah he's gonna come through that guy he must be getting his loadout yeah i think he's got it already we're just double peeking oh we got a team way up there right here bro nice well done dude the comms is so funny i love playing it's so good oh is he beaming you yeah there's a bit of drop on this car isn't that that kind of distance oh yeah for sure she's so used to the hdl what the hell was that was it an rpg who's using an rpg right we could go get another up at this point if you can't see it you got a vehicle coming from airfield towards you you hopped out loadout probably i'd imagine yeah team there you want to rush that yeah broke one a down them understand this guy behind the tanker here you got him well done oh i'm sorry he's trying to revive you get the crow buddy three munchies the birds gotta eat connor he's hungry the birds gotta eat what's your what's your

out now if you want he's standing wait he's at the boat yeah he's at the bush there we go he's become the bush fight uh one down dead gotta love those callouts there's a never mind he's dead he was fighting someone over there do you want to go uphill or did you want to try to take a building [Music] i feel like there is going to be someone up here though oh i just broke shot yeah that's from fire station i think he's in the bunker i bet yeah yeah he's coming out i think tactical ambush should we go down spoil the party i mean i this bunker is rough to push it's so dark i have a stun okay have you got a stun i'm down let's keep that ads up he's coming he's coming stand up go broke him well done oh please we just killed what were those names i don't even know what does that even mean welcome to n a jack yeah i've had some bad instances pushing that bunker there just because it's so dark stun grenade makes all the difference though oh dude it's so opaque i kind of want them to like remove it because the amount of times i've lost a game like even the battle hardened is that what it's called battle harden it doesn't do anything no it's not very effective also why why would you take it over is it what slot does it go yeah yeah the last one you need arms oh yeah for sure 100 oh oh there's a guy on me [Applause] wait was he just there the whole time let's go i don't no maybe you must have been yeah you must have just been chilling in that bush it was woods from black ops yeah he's very stealthy oh a fire station window oh yeah see that armored them once a bit worried about uh like over here location marked let's move you want to check up hill further yeah i feel like we should yeah this is the bush i've never seen a bush like this this is a nice bush yep there they go i'm shooting at diamonds down the first one the second one there it is there's the old double down now we've given our position away and we're ruined i'm scooping oh we don't have any cover here yeah he's gonna have to move though this guy over here there's some rocks that we could use let's go yeah let's let's hover down real low here there might be someone behind this shed um in the forest further you know what gonna air strike him he's shooting a different team they're gonna have to move down to one nice here's one over here down him as well he got killed from the left i think there's still someone on the right correct so yeah i think you're right because we didn't kill the blue guy hey there he is i broke him dude he beat me so hard while he was jumping what the hell was that he's one hb where's he at still behind that rock still behind the rock zone's moving this is gonna be rough because i have to reload yeah he's going shed now i'm gonna play gas here for a second he's moving right dead nice shot it's gonna be rough 2v2 yep now they're looking at us one was on the right okay trying to get this rock i'm actually safe downhill here i'm out of place i have a boxer do you have eyes on one's near yellow ow right guys hurt we gotta go to them we're screwed we need to pick uh oh no yeah i'm down this is all you i can't even see him did you down him well yeah down one uh i can't even ping him oh man so close twice twice you just got so lucky with the zone then yep i forgot to grab armor from the play box i don't know if it would have mattered though yeah no i don't think we'd have been able to get over there without them because they had uh they had defiled as well so they could just bob up and down and take cover yeah like a prairie dog that's challenging yeah so it's fun you can't complain about those games though those are solid yeah yeah they're fun you
