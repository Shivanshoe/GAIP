hello hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more watchdogs legion today we are playing in 4k 60fps a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one and we're going to continue from where we left off last time so i haven't really played the game much from the first live stream that we did so we'll be continuing the story and getting up to all sorts of hijinks so i'm looking forward to this also just to prove that we are actually playing in 4k here 4k resolution there i blocked the frame rate to 60fps and you can see the fps in the top right hand corner there as well and we're playing on the high preset but i knocked a couple of the settings up because i thought you know i can still maintain that 60 fps we've got ray traced reflections on here so we're going to get some real time reflections look really nice there's lots of like glass panes in this game for example and puddles on the ground and i'm sure we'll see some of those during the stream and also we've got dlss turned on which is it's it's kind of difficult to explain but in layman's terms it's nvidia's ai tool that boosts in-game performance and it changes the resolution and it uses ai to retain image quality that's probably a really bad explanation but there you go there it is and i think we're on our way to do a mission where we've got to take down clan kelly but i got myself a bike i don't know why i just thought i haven't really been on a bike yet this is the guy that we're playing as to start with this dude is they arrested that person i don't know i think i can like disrupt this guy with us distracted yeah he's got like a special electric thing oh yeah i got a cardboard box as well look at that i don't know why that's the thing that i've got but i do so we're okay with it cardboard box head kind of looks like robocop or something not sure anyway right let's get to this mission oh yeah i want my bike i've got about that we are running on a 30-90 here today as well don't shoot me no don't you dare i played about two hours last time that we streamed this no sign of suspect just getting to grips with the controls and everything like that we did a few of the main missions we were recruited a few people rolling around the town right now it's got some nice lighting in this game uh ambulance please a lot of you guys were uh upset with my driving last time because apparently i just uh i don't stick to the rules but it is what it is you know i mean in the uk we do drive on the left-hand side so maybe that's why people were getting upset but i am quite reckless with my driving i have to be honest if people get in the way they get in the way all right i have to get in here i think so i've delved more into kailyn lau's investigation and an enormous number of missing person cases center around the epc the inspector was definitely onto something and if albion cop on that he's dead set they'll find a way to make him talk let's find that contact find the contact indeed ow you want to go mate oh this dude needs some more melee i think i've got a silenced mp5 as well you know just for the memes no there's no alarm is there i don't see a problem here it's just a man with a box on his head and a suppressed mp5 it's no big deal that guy literally just fell over when i looked at him what is this place i'll be in private services i'm not entirely sure to be honest it's like some kind of checkpoint cardboard box man takes no prisoners i've already taken care of your entry get you in quick and quiet tell me you didn't stick me in the system i'm trying to stay off the grid yeah we're in no worries i'll spoof well come meet me on the rooftop the only place here that doesn't smell like piss wow the european processing center it processes deportees that's what it is conditions and forgetting about them but hey is to protect london right all right mate it was you wasn't it yeah i think so what's going on there this place is worse than our prison camp every day i see people come through here pawn from their homes and their families but i'd rather stay and keep our eye on things hop on once in a while like no oh [ __ ] horrible this is the kind of [ __ ] the government gets up to when no one's looking wouldn't surprise me a bit if people got lost in the system here yeah well people have been disappearing records say they have been processed but it doesn't add up no one ever properly leaves and with the kelly's prowling around like [ __ ] hyenas i am not too optimistic about the people slipping through the cracks great mary kelly's web spreads a little further what does she have our thugs doing here truth now about your missing guy the best place to start would be the epc database they keep a record of everyone that comes in and be careful all right we're gonna go to the database i i do read the chat yes i can see you guys in the chat you've got any questions please ask where's that it's up there i don't know why i've got blue surgeon gloves on as well i'm not sure what that's about but it is what it is does that go all the way back down why not get up there there will be a database here that we can search for evidence on angel lopez you want some cardboard boxes here for you i could distract this guy oh there's one behind me as well you're good i got you shh you want some oh gotta go for the dodgers or just head button you know that works as well kick him in the nuts overpowered i could have used that trap there couldn't i and we got a ladder here head on up we've got an access point i've got some nice reflections here uh i think i've got a spiderbot that could fit through there maybe do i have a spiderbot on this guy i've got a combat spider bar can i use him hi jack yeah look at that i think this spider bar's got a gun on it i mean you would assume so right with it being a combat wombat very dangerous very threatening that's so dark in there is that the door yeah can i hack that with this yeah okay cool get it spider download it i got some nice guns in here what's up cj how you doing oh nathan reyes what's up checker tell me you found something thank you for coming i have his file has been deleted from the main database along with hundreds of others still very detailed even when committing crimes against humanity the government doesn't skimp on paperwork here is a recording labeled exit interview you want me to listen to that oh i've got so many in here maybe they're just going to play it you know what we do with terrace lopez ah don't go pissing me off by denying anything we know you're with dead sick you think you were picked up on some random sweep nice same chance nothing to say well this is not going to go well for you then because i want information the rest of your cell where are they i want names places everything you've got you think i'm that i spill everything i know and what you let me go i'm not talking i know how this ends i think you do i'm going to throw you to the wolves [ __ ] you you're too pretty for that mate first they'll peddle you for dosh right then when you're using serious they're going to chop you up and send the pieces to the four corners i can take whatever you've got i almost feel sorry for you get him to the bloody clinic then bloody bloody [ __ ] they knew he was dead sex the whole time this doesn't look good for angel the clinic keeps government service hours which means it's closed we'll have to find angel the old-fashioned way and hack their ctos hub i'm gonna go back over there now limbo horrible living conditions unexplained disappearances it's almost as if the media are deliberately ignoring the situation here in favor of oh look here beatrice stokely 89 recently took up kickboxing to fill up a daze fascinating if the epc is a typical example of how humans treat each other i'd say a benevolent ai overlord is a step up wouldn't you [ __ ] off bags wow so rude aren't they hey gene what's up john thank you for coming i appreciate you guys being here for the stream we're going to be going for a couple hours tonight uh jake thank you for the five i'm doing good thanks how are you why is there a box on my head because why not rest here right why not i'm the bop serial killer look at this just go around murking everyone no big deal maybe i should like scan some of these people see if they're decent recruits or anything come on i should be okay through this bit tough drunk takes less damage she's got a load of stuff they're all drunk sorry sorry i forgot you're the good guy i'm bad this dude looks pretty extra melee damage why is he got a shock rifle where's he keeping that uh it's this way i think can i not get through there this access point oh no can i unlock that rotate i hate these stupid puzzles i'm so bad at them maybe i could get oh what has happened in here or it is a medical place right so kind of makes sense there's a little vent there that i could use maybe that one's already unlocked yeah i think i might need to use the spider bar here i just smashed that no maybe not tonight yes charles you named your fish after me okay i'm okay with that like that's you know that's fine you don't need to hide from me it's safe it's perfectly safe they do swear a lot don't they uh malt thank you for the two it looks straight out the last of us yeah kind of hey hennessy oh that guy was just taking a leak i just want to be left alone i just want to be left alone right okay so i think that may open up the first door there yeah some weird noises here in there what is that a wardrobe item cool i was a little spider thing yeah [Music] i'm kind of terrorizing these people yeah doesn't seem it doesn't seem like i should be here hey nathan there we go done it all right we're in take the box off if the box is on the head you know there's danger inbound are we doing the batman thing hey mr lopez we'll have you out of here in a minute or two is it jordy a gun to his back hang on he's going to be knocked out though he was injected with something [ __ ] what was that they stuck him with something let me get a closer look analyzing data facial analysis matches for both they're part of mary kelly's little pack so inspector lau was right after all clank kelly and albion are in bed together what a [ __ ] orgy that would be i mean that's a smack right there it reminds me of super hot distance microchips coated with bio-compatible glass to prevent rejection they [ __ ] implanted him man we'd like a tracker could be a medical monitor too no these are more sophisticated but i had to guess i would say they were designed to deliver a dose of some unknown compound not the kind of thing you find at your local corner shop control reconstruct the path he took if you want to see how this clip hanger gets resolved please do on it let's see where he got to get him hey run over here before he triggers what the zombie is it [ __ ] he's getting away get after him [ __ ] they're catching up on him come on angel we ran out here we're not the ladder oh they nearly got him come on he's gotta make it nah i don't think he's gonna make it went this way oh there you go [ __ ] up we don't have a match yet she's detective work done oh [ __ ] no way i'm betting that ship had something to do with this i think it's been triggered i know mary kelly's trouble but it's possible angel's alive we need to find him see what they did to him and what that [ __ ] microchip is all about seems like advanced technology for mary kelly and her band of thugs to be waving around could mary be part of a scary dark web hacker group like say oh i don't know pick one zero day interesting theory badly but hold your investigation algorithms for the moment will you angel needs us the incinerator they mentioned is probably the suburb incinerator it's practically right around the corner right around the corner is it all right let's go i can't help but try and speak in a land an accent when i play this game but it's obviously a very caricature london accent uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah what is it what did he say seriously no he didn't all right oh he did yeah what i'm breathing it's fine don't worry i'm going right yeah call me later call me later is it days oh it's time today why not just put up a sign that says suspicious a protester out there what's this guy why is he got a green dot on his head oh no they're a beatboxer i interact here okay she's ready to be recruited she's ready city's gone support hasn't it interested in maybe changing things for the better [ __ ] me are you dead sick i could use your help can't guarantee anything but we'll try what's up a friend was taken by albion during one of their [ __ ] no knock raids and they're undocumented so my hopes ain't high not to brag but we're sort of experts rescuing albion prisoners and all that we'll handle it if that had solved the problem sure but london's full of checkpoints and without papers my friend will just get grabbed again we need a passport some of that nice fancy [ __ ] that clan kelly sells ought to do the trick yeah oh we'll do the trick right i'll set things in motion cheers help me with this and i'll make it worth your while if you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean i know what you mean are you going she's crazy asada where do i get the john wick guy i haven't found any john wick personalities you know what i mean like if i founded john wick i'd get one uh anxious you'll like you again okay right so car carney medical are a secret company run by zero day slash albion who sell people pills under the guys that they're good for anxiety and headaches but really it's it's controlling them and triggering them that's what i'm going to guess is the story [Music] oh the cheek of itself i'll carry on with your story i didn't mean to interrupt i'm sorry i mean sounds like she had a bad time on a date hey ben what's up hey joey hey northern monkey i have a similar system including a 39 but can't get near a lock 60. can i run over my settings i did show them at the start of the stream start the video it's pretty much the high preset and i've turned a couple extra things on the lss is on and so is ray tracing i've just locked it to 60. it should look nice and smooth as well [Music] some of these building exteriors look brilliant i follow a guy called birdu who works at dice and he does media stuff for dice like screenshots and video work that kind of thing and he's been playing this and just taking screenshots of the architecture and some of the screenshots look they look like photographs like they're unbelievable look at this he's a potential recruit why is he a recruit go on lmg [Music] let's go fps is in the top top corner here it's pretty much locked at 60. you can keep an eye on it i don't think it'll drop from 60 maybe if there's a lot of stuff going on but it's uh it's pretty good uh simon no worries man yeah the code resets every two weeks well i think this location is just up here if not we can jump in a car oh no no no no come back come back oh that's a nice looking door it's a self-driving sports car some delineation sorry [Music] yeah it's right here this is where the kelly thugs brought angel gives me the [ __ ] chills now now keep your chin up we'll find him there's a camera network that might have caught where they took him i suppose we should try and find out all right we're gonna have to get in there i think okay hey skull face distract this dude oh oh brutal let's hurry and access that network shall we right oh you're a bad guy as well oh that's one of their favorites ruined i'm just killing all these potential recruits nothing here i'll check another area quick smart i'm not trying to come out got to check somewhere else that didn't kill him unlock the deep profiler tech upgrade to find recruitment needs okay oh ruined i mean this is supposed to be a suppressed mp5 but it's not very quiet is it let's be honest wow okay i mean he takes him down in one headshot pretty crazy that's a camera downstairs in it could i um yeah i could run this this lady over nothing's wrong with it it's fine someone's playing all these masks another trap there it's over there isn't it i mean the mp5 is pretty sick isn't it man just listen man just listen nothing can you play with john wick lucas if i can find a john wick character yeah but i don't know how you find them i've gone over the captured footage i was able to follow mr lopez down to the cellar but then i ran out of cameras not a problem you often have in london that's the plan then investigate the basement what let's do it how did we get down there then around there i think so don't you the cameras don't seem to get you either oh yeah having a laugh my oh my deadbolt trump's technology the door is sealed but this rubbish suit might do it either leads to the cellar or your grizzly death or both i suppose [ __ ] great all right we're going down the rubbish shoot listen i'm just gonna be with my people the trash that's all you need to know [Music] oh i thought i was going to have like a cool cut scene where i was sliding down the chute mi6 is how you get spies so i have to go around to mi6 savory eskimo thank you john wick knight elms neutralize vip mission reward hey david thank you for the donor what does one mean it just means like what's up uh i think the game may have crashed it tried to put me down the chute and it crashed because it's not loading anything which is unfortunate let me just see if i can fix this yeah i think it's crashed just reload it the trash was just too much loading back up now why is my fps camped at 59 just because it 4k 60 i mean it's pretty consistent frame rate for this game and the settings i'm playing what's up ragnarok hey donnie how are you doing just a long way down so you think that was just still loading or something what's up sword are you doing taylor did i ever play the last of us yeah yeah the original last of us is one of my favorite ever games brilliant oy of course i can lucas of course i can yeah i hope that's not a bug without mission or something because that would suck you just go down the chute and it crashes can you imagine you just can't continue the game that would suck what's up toast all right where are we on the map i think it's saved up to a certain point i don't know let's put a marker over there we're talking about video liam [Music] body piercer she's got a size 75 as well prop guns for numerous films you can find kind of special npcs that have multiple buffs that's a cool sounding car isn't it [Music] excuse us coming through well they do it he looks like a spy now this one here military analysts i'll save him oh my god 6g devlin he's got mad internet it sounds like a washing machine know what this is parcels i have to be an amazon delivery driver in this game i don't i don't know about that i'm not about that life that's part of the game that i just can't be bothered with how many hours do i have in this game so far this is uh like my third hour i streamed two hours when it came out and this is uh the rest of it so far is that it's nothing look at the reflection in the door that was cool i don't want to use this kill what did you say shut down that spider some fools using the spider find them dead i don't even know what happened my oh my deadbolt trump's technology the door is sealed but this rubbish chute might do it either leads to the cellar or your grizzly death or both i suppose [ __ ] great box head right okay is it gonna crash i hope not please don't crash [Music] we're good what the hell body's down there hey casper thanks for the five are they experimenting on them something like that they are going to use the players and inserts them into the brain oh there's caitlyn we saw her the first episode i think she's a cop oh right in the net all right then come on out i'm not gonna cut you are we cool come on i heard you too he was acting like he was gonna strangle her thanks for the distraction gave me the second i needed to take care of this filth jesus you're all right boss man was about to carve you out like a kebab wasn't he he was i'm fine i just need a second to catch my breath and find my files oh wait i recognize you caitlyn now the police inspector yeah we saw your vids wicket how you decided to tackle mary kelly on your own got me star struck now he wasn't always on my own who the hell are you're dead sick aren't you yes you tracked me to this slaughterhouse yes no no we were following our mate he got taken from the epc by the kellys and ended up here hard to believe this is where all those missing people ended up how they ended up then i'm sorry i don't think there's much hope for finding him alive the kellys have got a sick little operation going a kind of human organ black market i've been investigating them for months and they got my [ __ ] files at least they didn't take a kidney you should rest let me ring up my mates one of them will come and get you out of this [ __ ] off i'll go find angel and then i'll find your files yeah they seem important everything i've gathered on mary kelly almost enough to take her down [ __ ] we should look into joining forces make an alliance of some sort we want to take that [ __ ] down too yeah all right an operative is on their way to escort inspector lau so let's find angel and inspect allows files it says human organ what's this whistling about you can take the box off now um thanks for your help look at my boxy head we're joining forces goodbye oh no he's just whistling while harvesting the organs no doubt about it this whole operation is meant to harvest organs clan kelly's chopping off the parts they want and burning the leftovers only none of them were willing donors were they mary kelly's decided she's just taking what she wants [ __ ] me oh photograph [ __ ] hell their faces were bashed in got to do one of your facial reconstructions bags take a picture and i can run key details past various databases i've not done this yet i can take a picture i mean this is a bit a bit grim isn't it is that fine who is it unfortunately i must confirm that this is indeed angel local oh no [ __ ] angel he knew the risks i did too but never thought dedsec would get caught up in this mary kelly is preying on london's most vulnerable she's a [ __ ] monster a bit messed up taking her out needs to be a dead set priority now we need to find caitlin lowe's case files on mary kelly and see if my conjecture may be correct could mary kelly be in zero day maybe nothing to say nothing to say oh my god i can hear the elevator is that an elevator i don't know there's something i don't like that the furnace remember the rule of thirds hey tyler yeah we're on a 30 90. you got the files the inspector will be impressed now get out of here before someone decides to turn you into minced meat chop chop yeah no [ __ ] [ __ ] can i take a photo of myself in box head i want a memoir of this occasion my face this way and then get the camera out and i do front camera here's me and my best best friend larry you can do gestures right is that the one oh we're not in focus no no no this is all wrong great photo yeah love it you just walk around like this just play the whole game with your selfie camera there you doing me ollie thank you for the seven glad i caught the stream just discovered your channel a few weeks ago love your content thank you so much holly that's very kind here where do you get that box i don't know joey i just had it in my inventory dedsec caitlyn lau here i uh wanted to thank you i'd be nothing but an anatomy lesson by now or a pile of ashes you'll be happy to know that inspector lau has been escorted to a nearby refuge and is getting her wounds treated i'll be fine still a little flighty from whatever they gave me and frankly a little stunned that we've joined forces yeah i think dead set would end up working with a cop quite a team up but mary kelly needs to be stopped exactly you have an organization i have information and some backing from powerful people pool our resources and we might just take her down mary kelly's no petty criminal better contact the lot badly we need to get together and talk on these files i'll sync with inspector now and prepare a [Music] that was banging i think i'm getting this dead sex thing you wouldn't have been recruited if dead sex thought you'd be killed that easily right you're running some cheeky beta program bagley don't worry about bagsy you get used to his psychometry my job cuz it's judith can i climb up here fine don't worry nothing to say i found a potential recruit for you dropping a pin on your map i want to assassin's creed that oh that's the hms belfast isn't it right leroy it's fine i've been here in real life i wonder if it's like really detailed uh josh thank you for becoming a member i think it's the hms belfast let's take one of these boats over what sounds like minecraft yeah i've played valhalla there'll be some valhalla streams coming up as well so in real life there's a walkway that connects that you see that there that's kind of like the museum shop slash cafe that's where you get the tickets and then there's a big walkway that crosses the water and you can get on the boat it's an old uh world war ii boat hms belfast and you can go inside it you can go on all the decks down the ladders into the engine room the boiler room it's really cool not sure i mean i could could try and jump up no one let me go i think i could probably get a drone or something emil thank you for becoming a member that's cool oh there's a drone i could hack that drone maybe hijack there we go bring this down try not to get in the water put it on the back of the boat like that and then can i climb on it hey look at that there we go i now can get on the boat oh you go all the way up here oh yeah so in real life this here this gun is here but you can go inside it and it gives you a demonstration of how they would fight other naval vessels in world war ii and how noisy it was and how much smoke there was and then they had to reload and everything really cool and you can go inside the ship into the boiler room if you ever visit london obviously not at the moment in the future when we've got past pascovid go and do hms belfast it's well worth the money if you're into history that kind of stuff super cool would recommend it it doesn't look like you can go inside it though in the game all right where we got to get to all the way over there back towards westminster so someone in the chat said you can get a john wick guy over here in nine elms we're gonna fly over london why not well it's not very fast is it someone said in the chat how accurate is it um it's they've squished it down a bit i would say that but a lot of the buildings are accurate i mean it definitely feels and looks like london uh jesus thank you for the 20. straighten your back and hydrate all right mate thank you fashion designer potentially hostile no problem responding to the situation now [Music] let's get out of the way oh sorry don't mind me just uh another london reckless driver coming through no big deal oh look where we're going over by big ben at the moment that's covered in scaffolding uh they're doing renovations on it in real life you stay away [Music] what's the radio music like uh they have a lot of license tracks in it that's why i can't have the right the radio one so just get it i just get ruined by copyright oh i'm sorry lady are you okay she's fine she's got a land rover politician can we are we not listen i'm going in the pub we have a visual on the suspect oh no i can't get in there when i'm in pursuit are you going to come in here where did they go [Music] [ __ ] suspect has disappeared yep disappeared into the pub which you clearly saw happen but let's not mention that ronald thank you for the five cheers for the consistent entertainment right then team briefing i think we're gonna have to try and take clan kelly down here let's have a look let's do it mary kelly heads up the most powerful crime family in london clan kelly which should at least be easy to remember under her old man they were a bit player then he died and her rival started disappearing her enemies her friends her family they call her bloody mary for a reason early on mary abandoned cash in favor of cryptocurrency and brought the kelly's criminal business online it makes weapon smuggling drug running money laundering all a lot easier without a cash trail the woman single-handedly modernized organized crime in london she considers herself to be untouchable case in point from my files you retrieved darla covington 19 sasha haddad 28 radik stockkovic 24 all disappeared it's difficult to find good out these days isn't it love most people they ain't driven not like you because they feel worthless don't they the way that the world is how it uses people is horrible it's nice that you have a purpose oh that'll be me love we aren't finished here this was a courtesy a nasty piece of work give my regards to their families it's horrible losing someone you love nice meeting you caitlyn sure that she's in eastenders as you can see she'll never respond to interrogation but there is one place she feels comfortable talking about a reference inspector lao thinks a police bug in the kelly's headquarters may have the evidence she needs to finally convict bloody mary sandstone is their center of operations i know the data on that bug will take her down get it for me and i swear i'll put you away forever pushing the coordinates to your optics hmm this might be interesting here inspector lau i'm curious how you think you can bring mary kelly to justice now with no backing even before albion took over policing you couldn't lock her up and she goes on treating humans like cattle i had to work within the system yes it was corrupt i knew it i just didn't know how bad it was i thought a strong enough case couldn't be buried sure but it didn't work last time it looks like gta 5 with hacking and it's got some very similar elements yeah you do it can you play darts dance tutorial score zero each player starts with score 301 the winning throw must bring the score to exactly zero can't complain about more dosh uh yeah whatever i'm not i'm not good at darts i've never played it in real life so i have to aim for that one oh my god it's moving around like crazy oh god it's so difficult uh excuse me i was playing dance i knocked her out so hard she disappeared into the wall i was just trying to play dance lady report a 37 reduction in violent crime over the last [Music] years excuse me [Laughter] [Music] oh sorry it's fine it's fine no it's not fine [Music] such a good driver aren't i guys like really if you would rate my driving it'd be a 10 out of 10 wouldn't it i'm sure [Music] bbb [Music] sounds like a pod racer it's the phantom menace [Music] we're seeing a different side of jack today yeah maybe it's fine [Music] look at this weaving in and out of all the traffic like a bus it's like i'm in a michael bay movie except there's less explosions it's not as good because megan fox isn't in it [Music] all right we made it taxi please it's around this side i think i just realized there's no kids in this game is there security here is state of the art quite impenetrable unless of course you flew a drone through the window one of mary's mouth breathers left open mouth breathers investigation remember to be mindful of your actions the recording device is in a security room getting to be a simple matter of navigating the vents what the [ __ ] she's using these people as house servants against their will horrible in itself but a million times knowing they end up as unwilling organ donors oh look at this she's got suits of armor you have a real [ __ ] attitude problem do you know that please i need help [ __ ] idiot do you piss everyone off the way you're pissing me off wanker stupid i mean it's getting pretty heavy we've got a trap here can i hack that now so above me or below me i'm not sure that's a dog what a dog admiral why is there a dog admiral i think it's a bum there this place is massive maybe i should go back to the drone if it's still there hopefully it will be hey also apparently everyone swears all the time in london if you play this game and you're not from the uk you would think that you would walk out onto the street and normal people just swear at you straight away it's uh it's not like that you know hey we we're polite sometimes that's it let's see what kind of recording we've got on her i'd love to hack it just look at this place this is what comes of old crooked money the kelly family has been profiting from people's misery for a long time she's got this [ __ ] all over the manor so you've been in there before is that how you ended up in the basement of the southern incinerator we needed something incriminating so we decided someone had to get in here and plant a bug i wasn't going to assign someone else to do that you saw how mary uses the people she grabs out of the epc and the staff's uniform's not hard to mimic so i went in what i didn't know was that she had intel on our investigation my team i thought going off book would stop the leaks but she still knew we were coming she tortured me for the names of my team tried to break me but cops don't give up cops no turned out she already knew the whole unit and put hits out on them the woman is a mind [ __ ] [ __ ] well at least you don't have a microchip in you which knew she was dealing with you'd never about to wear that's how i ended up on that butcher's table so many reasons to want to rid the world of her but it wouldn't be enough to just put one in her brain my mates died trying to bring her to justice i have to honor that hmm kind of cool that you can just fly around in the vents with these things so i've got to get that one up where's that guy aren't puzzles in video games really fun they're really really fun i think i need to get that one over don't i that one doesn't work yet okay like that that's it ah like that unlike that puzzles the british accent is so forced but they've not just got one british person to do a normal british voice i think they i feel like they probably asked them to like overdo it a bit maybe i don't know the voices in this game are kind of weird though because um they use modulation because there's so many characters in the game that you can play us and what they've done is they've they've got like a certain number of people to record voice lines and then they modulate it there we go this is so annoying i hate stuff like this right so that one's got to be unlocked there i think that's it that's all blue so with that voice modulation that's it i think sometimes you get like weird voices because it just doesn't sound right done i've not tried rtx voice thorpe you know but it looks really good sounds good as well look at this state of you look what you've done to yourself after everything i've done for you you made me a slave all of us sweep the floors please let me go take this thing out back to your old life back to nothing back to you 2.5 screaming blighters in your dead end job and sucking off the doll you don't want that love the doll is benefits if you don't know it's scary i know but i got to keep tracks on my merchandise tonight and this kitchen knife that won't do it love cutting yourself affects my bottom line i can't believe like this anymore no you are right there it's all right sweetheart because i have another use for you zombie oh paying attention all we're good be sure and spread the word you know where this one goes get these two and all the others over to their venue and ready for the sale right away ma'am also the foreign investors have already landed and the drones are programmed ready to deliver the invitations and the coordinates to all the guests is that initiative i'm smelling peter initiative can be a dangerous thing can be misinterpreted she's crazy [ __ ] psych you're crazy well i'm kind of glad that i didn't go in there now you know all these snatches since we're waiting for our cordial invitation to marry kelly's tasteless theme party we can finally get back to what really matters solving the mystery of zero day who are they and why do they frame deadset for the bombings bagley what have we got glad you asked today the great ai detective has two leads for his dog's body politic obviously albion needs looking into but i also have a more unusual thread for you to pull on there's a new hacktivist group on the dark web scene called the 404 but instead of being in it for the lulls this lot seems to be in it for the brutal reshaping of society by any means necessary sound like anyone you know all right i've got some options in i've marked both on your optic all right cheers mate someone called lars asked in the chat if this is coming to ps5 yeah it is got a potential recruit for you i'll mark them on your map i think it's going to have ray tracing on ps5 as well same for xbox series x i was doing one of my routine head counts and it turns out one of you is completely unaccounted for probably kidnapped bollocks quite fortunately i took a look through our ever expanding enemies list and i think i've identified the culprit finding him should lead us to our missing operative i've got this [Music] all right let's have a look did we get any i need to get more tech no i can't i can upgrade some of this see that looks quite cool electro fist yeah go on then go on then personal sports vehicle when did i get her oh my man's back this guy's sick i switched to him i got him incapacitated last time can you turn rtx off on console um it's not rtx on console it's called just ray tracing let's have a look at our missions then yep in the armor all right let's do this one i'm starting to speak a bit more london now where's that on the map oh it didn't did that not track it 2160 meters away what i didn't see it on the map usually it puts like a little yellow symbol on the map but i don't see it maybe i've got to go back here yeah i think it is a latex coat badger gap in the armor team breathing a while she continues to destroy lives with those microchips but for now we've no choice that perhaps it's time to have and perhaps it's time to ruin right let's talk about albion pmc the only british organization to successfully oppress more of the developing world than the british government led by nigel cass a man the partisan media calls a charismatic visionary and amnesty international calls a war criminal albion was given the key to the city to re-establish order following the bombings well that's suspiciously convenient it is so that's two reasons why we need to find an angle on cass we've found one his name hamish balagi born london bellati was a recipient of the cass foundation technical scholarship of 14 which included a mentorship with cass himself at 16 bernardi designed cassie's first drone fleet fun fact caster laid the launch by a week so it would land on the largest birthday cass sounds like balaji's second dad why would he help us they had a falling out after an incident in the night at delta three years ago a buried human rights investigation accuses cass of ordering a drone fleet to wipe out a village protesting the construction of a pipeline but the drones malfunctioned before they could but largely his name is the likely saboteur he's been on the run ever since but now tracking data shows he's reappeared in london [ __ ] he's looking for redemption like with the protesters this guy designed casa's drone fleet i think he's trying to disarm albion he covers his tracks well but that's a good guess unfortunately according to this albion intelligence report intercepted by our friend caitlin lao cass knows baladi's in london as well so that's the op make contact with bolaji before albion finds him then convince him we have a mutual enemy in cass so this guy's our best chance to stop albion and clear our names and the largest private army on earth wants him dead no pressure has jack recruited the queen i don't know i don't know if you can do that i've narrowed down the area where we're most likely to find hamish balagi i've pushed the coordinates to your optic this guy yeah someone asked uh i think it was charter rtx is turned on um so we've got the i think we've got high reflections on maybe i can show you guys like a good example of that i mean there's a puddle there that's a real time reflection right there i want it to be night time and raining because that's when it looks really good hey jk what's up i recognize that voice yeah sabine's voice the woman that was just talking then i was like it was driving me crazy i was like i recognized that voice from somewhere and i couldn't work it out and apparently the voice actor has been in assassin's creed syndicate i think or black flag one of those games but it also sounds a lot like emily from a stream team fred and emily they're called friendly she sounds exactly the same and i was like oh okay that's it that's where it's from which park is this is this supposed to be hyde park no hyde park's a lot bigger than this isn't it what park is it i don't know we're in westminster what park would that be was it just like the the buckingham palace uh the grounds i don't know not entirely sure is it just westminster park duck island cottage is that what it's called duck island it's in james park yeah i did drive a net platinum but i don't know which park it is hyde park's massive isn't it i'd park is over by it's over by like harrods and stuff isn't it it's in james park most people are saying james i need to actually learn my london geography a bit better i've been there loads but you know i've been to most of the landmarks it's just you don't really take it in when you're just going from tourist destination to destination you need to live there so i think this is by the churchill war museum that's what it looks like if i'm not mistaken in real life i think this is churchill's world war ii bunker because i've been there and you can go downstairs and tour the whole bunker it's really cool land rocket squished everything you know i'd love to see i'd love to see a video where someone goes to these places in real life or they use google maps and they just show them in the game and then in real life a bit of a comparison you know how accurate is watchdogs legion that'd be quite cool video that'll pop off as well a lot of people had watched that if it was well done that'd be really [Music] popular i kind of like driving down all these side streets reminds me of being in an uber in london or a taxi because they always take the shortcuts down the weird side streets to avoid the traffic london traffic is an absolute nightmare it's never not busy all right we're in camden now has been snooping into albion's affairs of course but i've been able to determine that most of his activity stems from this area time to introduce ourselves not so fast hey miss isn't in according to his home security and before you get ideas he's rigged his front door to a series of traps designed to delete all of his data and then your life not necessarily in that order got a similar setup myself maybe paranoid but to be fair you are an armed insurgent trying to break into his flat anyway you should be able to connect to the local grid and use security cameras to disarm his traps message received assam is trapped suppose i can get in using this i mean i'm going to be getting all sorts of diseases here aren't i yes shivan but i can't show it or talk about it yet but that'll be coming up soon i believe the main interface is on the rooftop bagley those windows are they a viable option sure if you can get there three options here one use the window washing platform two find a cargo drone three give up go home and resolve to be a better person copy that copy that up uh i guess it's up again getting through this window maybe sorry what doing roly polies into the vent i used to holly occasionally i do but i stream on youtube now it's my main platform that's what my audience is you know it does look high david yeah look at this the place is packed to the gills with traps you could force the traps to unlock by rewiring the power copy that welcome to claire and present danger and welcome to fascist london oh my god it's a shotgun disturb you in time you'll barely feel it we have to wake up people if there was a playbook for setting up a totalitarian police state albion would be most of the way through it and working on the epilogue they certainly took advantage of the fallout from the bombings didn't unless we do something we can't wait for someone else to fight back we are the change not another one of these is this a timer as well am i just going to explode at some point oh i was done with these puzzles nah mate there's more i can't unlock that one because it doesn't have power source with that one [Music] goes round and down that's not so that one needs to go out here yo this is so annoying that one's done i don't need to change that one where am i from i'm from the uk hey matthias what's up if i can get a different view of this you used to play battlefield before jack first one battlefield 2. dude i played all the battlefield games abdul played all of them it's so easy is it okay unlock the one below you oh i see what you're saying yeah yeah let's put that down there and unlock that thank you very much for the tip i didn't even see that one like that so we need to get power to that one now there we go got it yeah i didn't see that one down there the traps are disarmed now if you go through the front door of the flat it's much less likely you'll be killed oh i don't want to be killed i mean there's a shotgun and c4 explosives everything oh here we go look at this [Applause] assassin's creed easter egg i love that it's raining now so that's cool did they fix the lag i mean um the fps is a lot better with the latest patch and driver if you're trying to play on pc make sure you got the updated driver because it runs a lot better for me now do people from the uk eat peanut butter and jelly sandwich yeah not very often though it's more of a snack for kids i mean i can't remember the last time i've had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i don't really get a craving for it move one more muscle chief and i'll blow the whole place with you in it now now don't eat for that who the [ __ ] are you and what you doing in my flat you with albion wrong think more insurgent what that's sick yeah right and i'm che guevara you're done no listen to me albion knows you're in london you need to get out of here now [ __ ] me you're telling the truth huh [ __ ] hell thought i was careful [ __ ] idiot amish look cuss is worse than you know worse than we know we know we know why else do you think i'd [ __ ] be here baby cause nigel cass is paying you that's a [ __ ] merc's work we're not with cass he [ __ ] tried to kill us mate we need to stop him and we need your help to do it mate you don't know [ __ ] you have no idea what class is and what movement [ __ ] and i'll be in squad's closing in on you i guess you won't learn about that part [ __ ] think you think [ __ ] fine table it i'll buy some time just go move it someone in this chat just said too busy eating cold beans bluntman no not many people eat cold beans let me tell you that cold beans sound absolutely disgusting we would never i would never at least i just had to address that he's got a machine gun [ __ ] sake don't just stand there albion won't be fussy about who they shoot are we getting out of here i'm gonna take their car luckily this guy's got a grenade launcher so we're all good [Music] this is the first kind of car chase that i've seen in the game oh no no no tactical ramp i'm gonna get down an alleyway or [Music] something [Music] it's fine okay it's ram that's cool i'm gonna hide down here [Music] everything will be fine hey we did it i think all that excitement convinced our new friend hamish that we need to work together to tackle cass he's willing to cooperate sorry sorry i'll pay for it i've got insurance [Music] it's fine it's fine all right chief that was a pretty slick escape it was wouldn't it i believe you so i'll say this nigel is planning something and i don't think i could stop him on my own if dead sex everything i've heard you'll help me we can help each other there's a chance cass had something to do with the bombings what could he be planning that's worse than that no no that's not like well not exactly see nigel's got to see himself as the hero he's an arrogant [ __ ] but he's not a cynic every place we go into he we would have some mad plan to fix all his problems with robot police or automated crop fertilizing or some [ __ ] society was a technical problem and people are just bugs in the software you know you work around them or you squash sorry chief i got a switch proxy server so they don't trace me i'll hit you right back on voice listen i've got an inside man right a contact in albion says nigel's got this big meeting happening at white tower he'll be talking about a major project he's got planned for london working on an upgrade of his private police state brilliant does this prick ever take a day off whatever he's up to we need eyes on that meeting i've always wanted to be in on a caper okay first things first we'll need eyes on the impregnable target so off you go i'll crack on with assembling the right personnel to round out this ragtag bunch of misfits ah [ __ ] i'll be inside with security sniffing my proxy ip what's the trace to detonate your signal i've got to deal with this i think this is their contact all right mate you lot certainly know how to pick your targets you do know that albion have set up their headquarters in there right yeah we know but cass is launching some new project and i can guarantee it won't be good we need to do something you know [ __ ] nigel cass you're right nothing good can come of this luckily i hear loads of sob stories working in our pub and near this place quite a few from albion are dissatisfied with the status quo you turn on the charm and i'm sure you can get one to join the good guys even got a candidate in mind interesting can you send me their personal info i'll have bagley push it along good luck love wow yeah it's a live stream someone just asked in the chat if it was live it is tower of london security will be tight how do we do this i like to help fam but now i just caught a whiff now before the ctos cameras it'd take him less than five died dimi i ain't risking my pretty face we need an albion insider for our cable one who's willing to turn car we gotta recruit someone reached out to a contact who works in a nearby pub where better to find a bleakly disillusioned anti-hero numbing their conscience with drink but secretly desperate for redemption i've let our contact know what we're in the market for and she's nearby we're aware of an albin employee who might be approachable recruiting an albion employee easier said than done they're jack-booted thugs who regularly murder civilians if finding a disenchanted employee is really that difficult humanity's much worse off than i thought it would also be quite useful to have someone on the inside for however long that lasts nigel's real good at sniffing out spies personal experience speaking yeah not really in a sharing mood right now fam yeah fun why aren't you in a sharing mood the british people actually talk like that not really papa chris and there's definitely a lot more swearing in this game i think the developers are maybe uh making a joke out of the british people i'm sorry that's fine i'm running late i can recruit you what's up tracy larson with a bagley actually the strangest thing about her is that she's not weighed down by old soup cans at the bottom of the thames she's a load of dodgy gambling debts and she's refusing financial help from a rich friend i've never known a gambling addict to turn down cash something's going on look at you keeping up maybe this friend can help explain our prospects unusual behavior not a bad idea arrange a meeting no it's a beefeater i can pretend to be a beefeater so teddy bear now don't fight the drone [Music] i mean that guy said that he hates dead sex so i don't know if it's a good idea finding this but whatever oh [Music] no kick him kick him what it's a bit glitchy like isn't it [Music] shhh ow [Music] maybe i shouldn't be just attacking random people but i kind of like it they're just gonna keep coming at me aren't they i could just get my gun out and shoot him oh my god there's so many all right we're getting out of here [Music] oh that's john wick [Music] break the guard pray the god finish goodbye you didn't see nothing yeah this dude knows karate yeah that's it i don't know why he's got like a purple hologram behind him what's that about you can't huh you [ __ ] albion dogs think you're tough [ __ ] in it you're just some rank and i got paid to throw punches around why is ugh that's not on is it coming back [Music] you can't go around just whacking random people dude that's not acceptable come on you're better than this a better striker than mcgregor maybe you know this is pretty tough unemployed yet they've got a full auto smg it doesn't really make much sense does it hey give me that give me that sports car give me that sports car it's fine don't worry recruit ricky gervais i don't think ricky gervais is in it griffin [Music] oh that'd be cool it'd just be a really awkward npc it made you cringe all the time in a good way oh just destroyed that red phone box i'm sorry london let me ruin that nice sports car that's fine that's not good nope no big deal i need to be around the other side don't i david you can't really do any character customization in terms of how they look like how their faces are but you can change their clothes heard you need some help what's up this is about my friend isn't it oh god she looks like a queen right she's younger over her head go on she's destroying her life with the stupid gambling i tried to help her get out of debt but no now she's off to meet those clan kelly thugs they're going to kill her that's sound like dead sex ally we'll see what we can do hmm i've tracked our naughty little gambler to a lucky crawling with clan kelly goons let's go kill him rescue them from the gangsters could be a bit more specific sorry just murdered you no big deal this game needs to bop my bill that's what it is what what the [ __ ] you think you're doing our gambler is somewhere in the area and just based on how these things go probably immortal peril get to her fast as you can you're always immortal here let's get her out this has to be a misunderstanding yes help get out of there [Music] you know i'm sick of this [Music] you want some i didn't think so all right come with me come on let's go you're not so smart now are you can you climb over this wall there's no gun are you gonna come out of there [Applause] yeah she did it are you getting the bike no i need a bigger vehicle this van that's a nice bit of graffiti well done let's make sure they're all right i mean what i didn't do anything we did we didn't go anywhere you're right hey i knew what i was doing it would have worked out just fine huh okay maybe i didn't but i nearly had it it could have worked what do you mean so i had this plan right i guess so in debt to them they haul me in and bam once i'm in their hideout i stick them with a virus except they were all no money we break your kneecaps and i'm all well that escalated no [ __ ] but hey maybe you could do it and then we split the dosh like robin hood and little john well she's certainly entrepreneurial though not exactly risk averse if we help her out she may be sympathetic to our cause yeah i found your clan kelly lieutenant used the same password for everything since middle school should make a good target for the crypto virus i'll send you their details my password for everything is password123 no one ever guesses it it's a really good password guys if you're thinking like oh i need a good password password123 best password out there no one's ever had my accounts it's cool angle down like here isn't it but you can't see as much there must be some mad easter eggs in this game for that crypto stealing virus is around here message received hold up nope nothing is that bomb going off what's with all these beeps random beeps every now and again uh oh it's all the way up there how do i i want to get up there over that way i think i was going the right way unless there's a route around here some beer did i get early access uh i think the game's out now isn't it pretty sure the game's out i had early access to this last week and i streamed a couple hours but i haven't played it since then what is that a security turret it needs a key gonna go up another level maybe it could have been the other way yeah i don't have a key oh here we go maybe this is it as long as i don't drop down and die get ready with the virus upload that's him there what's the problem [Music] supposed to be your job huh upload complete now scarpa or they'll kill you for sure sorry it's horrible virus install complete i'm sure she'll appreciate that let's send her the good news mission accomplished i know i can see all the numbers in their account getting smaller and the ones in mind getting bigger we make a good team we should do this again there's strength in numbers you know you should join that sec hell yes i'm in hell yes oh that'll get us in the tarot land and then oh i love all right how are you doing right we've got a swap to that recruit now so we got a a woman on the inside what's an army without its soldiers glad to have you yes i'm so ready to help out the cause excellent sounds far too keen way way way too keen we have an albion operative on our roster we should let them know they're needed nigel cash's meeting will begin soon approach the tower of london when you're ready all right we've got to get to tara london we do a fast travel over there get across the bridge oh we are all the way down south london here sheriff london she sounds like a happy supply teacher that's a pretty good description yeah [Music] i know a few shortcuts [Music] i love that sounds very good oblivion npcs yeah maybe maybe that's it have you seen the videos of that guy does where he just pretends to be the guards in oblivion he's so good at it he's absolutely nailed it i feel like i'm playing colin mcrae rally here it's a fast car [Music] rtx is on oc1 gaming [Music] i wish it was raining now [Music] do you know how to drive no jenny i don't sorry is that how you drive jenny i don't know that work does that work for you [Music] you have arrived at your destination if we're lucky word hasn't spread that you've hung up your jack boots just try to put on your meek harmless broken by the system face oh and don't forget your uniform i think there was perfect driving park the car and everything all right so i should be able to get in here as soon as i'm under cover hi i've not used the subway yet i didn't know that you could do that i like driving anyway it's good fun rtx slogan i wish it was raining yeah put that on the back of the box uniformed access okay got it i mean oh my god what she's got giant lmg is it okay all right just act normal looking sharp your ex-colleagues won't pay any attention to you unless you let them take a close look oh ben i'll let him take a close who look that it's just me barbara it's barbara it's barbs fine you know who i am you met me last weekend we went for a coffee together yeah yeah okay it's fine investigating disturbance nope there's no what disturbance i haven't done anything no no no no this reminds me of assassin's creed i'm sure there's a mission in assassin's creed where you do this all right we're in we made it [Music] hey mark it's relaxing now we're gameplay any disturbance in here and nigel cass will surely cancel his meeting avoid being detected by your former colleagues or this operation is a bust all right i mean the second nigel won't have anything important on this floor he seemed to know an awful lot about him yeah i was albion too if he hadn't tweeted that me and cass were close ones looked up to him he was bigger than life fam literally a tech genius and i was just a gear red kid i wanted to be like him that's why i joined up seriously didn't find out he was a murderous prick until later i heard someone saying dead sectors back they better not be just a bunch of terrorists pretending to have models this fine door clearly requires a security pass brill use one of the nearby computers to create your forgery be careful you don't audrey does with trespassers chop some up into little pieces and feed them to the pigs probably i'm gonna go like print myself a pasta i've not seen him yet breakdown it'll take some time for the forgery to be ready to keep you occupied i dragged up still images in a recording from an internal investigation into cassini's death let's see it internal psych assessment asa1 subject cast nigel mr cass experienced a deeply traumatic event when he witnessed the murder of his father gareth cass he began exhibiting symptoms soon after what he frequently described as the random event mr cass's initial symptoms included insomnia paranoia distorted blame and recurring flashbacks however he appears to have channeled his anger and self-described powerlessness into his work to ensure that albion become quote a mechanism for preventing unpredictable violence it seems somewhat of a mania edging on psychosis for me this raises concerns about mr cass's fitness to run a multi-national security company but i cannot at this time make any recommendation beyond continued monitoring especially considering that i have been asked to close this fire oh wow i almost feel sorry for him but maybe he should have gone through therapy instead of being put in charge of securing london yeah well nigel was never close to anyone but his dad and me i guess never had much faith in people really well the past is ready but rough if this resistance thing doesn't work out i doubt you'll make a living as a document forger let's give it a go anyway nigel cass awaits cool so we got the id now jamie thank you for becoming a member i appreciate that blackfyre what's up dude how close is this to london irl a lot of the landmarks are pretty accurate and some of the streets and locations but they've had to squish stuff down a bit so things are a lot closer together but it it looks and it feels like london you know i'll give it that it's pretty good i think they've done quite a good job with recreating something that feels and looks like london although it's not one-to-one pretty pretty decent all right we can get in here now how are you getting on with those metrics the deadline is coming up quickly you wouldn't do to miss it he's presenting to the stakeholders right now i know i know but if i mess this up i think we can see the meeting now welcome to project themis our new autonomous drones oh no these drones can identify isolate and terminate threats before they can do harm they can go anywhere and predict the future see everything they could kill a man alone in an alley or in a crowd of hundreds with perfect precision hemis drones can do what humans have always struggled to act immediately and decisively terminator isn't it without your support i couldn't stand here and tell you i promise you with the launch of project emmis london will be the first city in the world to be made truly safe mr cass i was hoping you called us all in here today to discuss the ethical issues long oh it's all right the commissioner cares as we all do i admire his his passion and his dedication let's talk ethics well for one feminist goes far beyond albion's mandate we really should have more government consultation i see delay the launch so that we can debate and assess the details we're missing the human element here i can get the defense minister on the line right now if you feel you must now he's dead yeah i knew it so predictable it's the human element that got us into this no more debate delay indecision understand this i will not allow anyone not even myself to jeopardize themis now will our friends at titus be ready you are the cornerstone of the project after all do you need to consult any outside parties uh no we'll be ready ah and just in time criminals running our streets illegals threatening our families the police commissioner himself assassinated by terrorists decisiveness is hard but here's the best part once this decision is made no more will be required of you hmm attention a building my security sweep has been initiated due to dock i'll warn you about that forgery your uniform will help don't let them get a close look at you how do i get out of here bags it's fine wow this tech is so cool oh how about that tech good old-fashioned steel well i gotta go downstairs no dude here hey stop looking at youtube videos i mean those sound effects were a bit weird were they uh black thank you for becoming a member that's kinda enrique i'm getting a new monitor 30 inch curved gaming monitor 200 hertz dude that sounds sick congrats that's going to be wicked for playing games on did you see that yeah you saw that didn't you and this one this lady is like this uh baton that she's got is awesome [Music] really strong did i not finish you off there we go right she's an absolute ninja oh he's firing the guns at me now maybe i should bring out the guns i don't want to kill anyone use my cloak works a treat see you later boys the button sound hurts it's like vr chat mike is all right hey bertie you're staying cool thank you oh we're going through this the catacombs can be very uh persuasive sounds like he plans to launch themis asap and from the way he was talking i don't think it's a sort of genie that goes back into the bottle christine aguilera would have something to say about that i never read it what's up oh that's easier okay money i mean there's zombies down here or something what's all these noises about damn i just dropped down there didn't i i feel like the game is leading me this way why can't i hear people crying i mean what there's a paranormal game now yeah that's back where we were
