hello and welcome to part one of my walkthrough of resident evil village i'm sure that this is going to be absolutely insane i'm really looking forward to it and if you're excited for this hit that like button leave a comment below cheers without further ado let's get this show on the road enjoy long ago a young girl went with her mother to pick berries for her father who was hard at work but the forest greeted them with a dark cold silence the bushes empty yet determined to find the berries the rascal broke free from mother's grasp and vanished into the trees mothers worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on over vine and under branch and into the forest deep feeling strange eyes upon her the girl recalled mother's scary bedtime tales and her throat became bone dry then the pat lord appeared he greeted her warmly and bit his own wing come child quench your thirst he said so she drank the thick dark blood and smiled with joy passing through the graveyard menacing storm clouds loomed and the air turned bitingly cold the girl was shivering in her thin clothes then a dark weaver appeared and with a click of his fingers crafted mist into a beautiful dress come child warm yourself he coaxed so she clothed herself and smiled with joy across waters deep and ominous she went hoping a boat she found would carry her home but hunger's grip tightened and her heart grew heavy then the fish king appeared and offered one of his many fins come child eat your fill so the girl ate and smiled with joy once more continuing on she soon entered the forest's dark heart then an iron steed appeared bearing a beautiful golden gear the creature said nothing as the girl approached and snatched what she thought was another gift [Music] the horse grew angry and summoned the other monsters terror filled the girl's heart as the wild wind rose around the beast suddenly a witch appeared dark yet regal gifts we gave but more you took she snarled so more in turn is due in a blink the girl was trapped inside a mirror there she's asleep what is with the creepy story she's only six months old woman at the store said it was traditional a local tale besides rose doesn't seem to mind because she doesn't understand it thank god we moved here so that she wouldn't have to deal with any of that remember there's nothing wrong with my memory you're just being paranoid it's not never mind i'm sorry but i'm not paranoid i'm just cautious then go cautiously take your daughter to bed i'll finish dinner that's a nice looking baby interesting way to intro the game there it's okay rose your mother doesn't want to remember it i can't blame her did you say something nothing i'll put her down she's cooking something up look at this next-gen food looking good right i've got to go put the baby to bed the detail in these environments man that's what impressed me so much about the demo oh they're there it's like i said to your mom that book's too scary for you it's okay next gen baby calm down calm down calm down everything's gonna be fine almost there honey well she ain't gonna sleep in there is she look at this play room though put it down in the car there you go sweetheart don't you worry i'll be right downstairs daddy won't let those weird fairytale monsters get you and she's out for the count it's my office good some notes rosemary winters that's the name me and i had another fight rose is fine ethan rose is looking good i want to know what she was cooking [Music] got some wine vegetables chicken maybe is she okay sleeping like a well like a baby hmm that smells good what's that oh hands off mister it's chubba de la gum it's a local recipe wow you've gone full native haven't you local wine too but if you're gonna keep sulking all evening maybe you shouldn't have any you really have to stop worrying it's just finding you in louisiana the pregnancy chris moving us here military training it all happened so fast you know well at least we're all together you me rose now everything's going seriously i think we can just forget about what happened in louisiana it happened so long ago i just i don't understand why you are so oh my god mia get down [Music] oh god chris what the hell sorry ethan no what why that's pretty dark gonna all move rose what the hell you doing with my daughter package secure sir take him away i said get your hands off her ethan no oh they killed my wife took my baby but chris was the one that helped us in resident evil 7 so i'm a bit confused hey doctors hey now think positively all right we talked about this i know we hardly talk about anything else i keep telling you it's not rose that i'm worried about well then what are you worried about look she's gonna be fine i just know it what else matters we matter ethan you matter you just remember what are you talking about is there something you're not telling me come on talk to me damn it i have to take this i think there's something still left you know oh look at that little baby adorable answer the phone ethan jesus what are you talking about where's chris redfield and rose what the hell happened to you so they were taking us somewhere but obviously it was attacked by something or it crashed mission objectives eliminate target recover body secure rosemary winters and eat the winters move them to site c for further investigation what could have done that i can hear the blinker it looks like we're in the middle of nowhere here the audio's very good as well super immersive no there's something in the trees no no no ow i was gonna say bit dangerous definitely something moving it could just be an animal okay that's a crow or a raven covered in blood and there's some more significantly more oh my god i'm still alive nope you can barely see okay i don't even have a gun or anything where did that thing go oh some piggies in there hello no this is uh it's not the one for me just some rope time does not work would you want to drink that anyway i don't think so it's like garlic oh keep the vampires away hello nothing yeah i knew it it better not be something in here with me oh oh it goes a bit random just an owl staring at me what's on this

fortunate office something big just run through literally through the house that's thick wood as well oh now we can sprint now looks like the sun's coming up [Laughter] awesome look at that view beautiful big castle maybe maybe they're out the food's hot i can't get over how detailed this is so cat no hey where did that thing go some blood in here nothing oh i wonder if you can do something with that later on do not enter with some bolt cutters so many ways to go oh it's very ominous i mean just hanging goat heads what happened graveyard workshop ceremony i don't think we should go to the graveyard just yet you know got some corn that looks all right locked due to missing homeowner i'm not surprised that the homeowners have gone missing whether they were kidnapped eaten or just got the hell out of here okay for that some force could break it oh it's a knife yeah got our first weapon first aid let's go did they just run out of the house if that one isn't hot soup's not hot oh no

[Music] well left the door open for me that's locked i'm just going to check if there was anything that i missed because that was just crazy there's got to be some items here craft some stuff maybe i got the majority of stuff in this building i was just spamming f to try and pick up as much stuff as possible oh man deary deary mate i need to use that yeah hello who are you in life and in death we give glory uh hello you shouldn't be out here it's not safe what the hell hey can you hear me it's you the child's father child hey wait do you mean rose is she here rose rose yes yes she is in great

the map it shows you what you've completed in terms of when you search stuff that's cool what the hell is that is that something i can had that kind of thing in resident evil 4 didn't they where you could like see shiny things i did i got it yes crystal fragment treasure white mineral could probably sell it i mean i had to use a shotgun shell there unless i can yeah i should have just crafted some handgun ammo shouldn't i the shotgun is precious it's very very precious i need another item for that we offer these goats of warding to protect the village and its people i guess you could shoot that but i feel if i do there's going to be some kind of consequence so i'm not going to do it it said it was bad so we get the maidens crest and we can save yay it's our first save there she is big mommy malka's she's back that leads to the castle so we can put that in here rotate it that one's all good guess this leads to the castle castle dimitris oh it's gotta be a secret here surely maybe there'd be something i hope i'll take it head on through here are we locked this way isn't it there was a shotgun in here in the demo [Music] make weapon shortcuts cool arcade that i want all right
