especially your mvgs oh you can actually see them come down that's cool you got the right shield it's upside down check your fire modes it's upside down i suppose that makes sense though right yeah because when you turn it over your back it's probably like that yeah that was smooth let me take point i got the shield that big tomorrow through it doesn't look big enough for you tom i have to be honest oh my god oh jesus come back go back hang on he could shoot your legs jesus christ man wow good thing you went first i know tom and jack went in there earlier i don't think he was reloading time he was but he did a very fast reload back he's recording he's reloading jeez the speediest reload in the west literally the fastest reload i've ever seen jack he's got some sort of smg he's got videos like dude everyone lives we do all the objectives we get in a race that's immediately found an enemy so this is uh definitely going to be a hot zone poor dead i mean it's always hard zones well i'm using a bean bag on jack so well you shouldn't have brought that tomorrow yeah i don't i don't think this is gonna be the map for that paint the wall with them has anyone else got a beanbag gun no
