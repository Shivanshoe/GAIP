war zone is pain i mean we already knew that right but today that was really reinforced for me so i haven't played for about five days or so just taking a break playing all the games doing other stuff you know how it goes and i thought i'd jump back on today and i wanted to do a video on the mp7 and how it's kind of good again so i played some solo matches that was my first mistake but there were some great highlights in here and i wanted to show you some of the best moments from three of the matches that i played today now the first one you're watching here started off okay picked up a kill with a bison and got that loadout straight away mp7 and i switched up as well i'm using tracker and high alert because i thought for solos maybe i'll give it a go i kind of feel like you need ghost in trios and quads but in solos let's try something different tracker high alert yeah i'm gonna be showing up on uavs and heartbeat sensors but i'm not hiding from anyone and first two kills there with the mp7 absolutely demolished those players my bounty was here in the fire station cheeky jumped through the door and predicted one movement got the kill nice and easy there was sitting pretty on four kills now i was being hunted they were below me shoot the window out make them think that i've climbed up the tower lo and behold they come up the ladder and they get dominated by that mp7 although to be fair they did take away all my armor there so not okay i didn't reload i forgot to reload i don't really do this very often it's very rare i forgot and i ended up being killed by this guy because i only had 20 bullets in the mag struggled with the strela which was my secondary i was gonna get the swiss in that second loadout and this dude executes me on the roof that doesn't happen very often either i wanted revenge in the gulag hit the wraith with the stun here easy flank easy kill there with the ak drop back in spot the guy they're still on the roof and i picked my loadout up they weren't looking there's someone behind me they jump off the roof to get their load out their second loadout with ghost big mistake broke the armor there with the mp7 down with the mp7 and then i wanted to test out this new zombie takedown just i mean that's cool right like you get your own personalized zombie in warzone probably uav and i did notice in that previous firefight that i got some highlight from behind me and here they are the bush wookie of dreams are running towards me blissfully unaware that i'm right there in front of them even though they looked at me about 20 seconds earlier so this is the guy again that did the takedown on me they won their goo lag they come back and i mean get out of the game mate you know that's what you get for doing a takedown on me blah blah blah skip to the end [Applause] a couple of firefights outside get the down get the finish with the mp7 i'm feeling good about this one you know five other players left 10 kills on the board i've got a rough idea where everyone is and i put the sentry gun down here because i knew there was someone in the building on my right and they've got a right chill so i thought well if i move here and they try and shoot me they're going to get shot in the back sentry gun does a bit of damage there but i mean it's just a little tickle really isn't it not much and it actually stays alive in the gas i didn't know that end game here three other players left i walk up to this door again feeling pretty strong gas is bounced behind me just waiting i don't know where people are really at all i'm just trying to play it sneaky beaky be as smooth as possible rose king comes out the door and just absolutely beams me i did not have a chance to react then at all just pre-fire the hell out of me so that's the end of that game number one it's done i wanted to spectate you know just see what happened there's only two players left who's gonna win kind of kill me got 15 kills and just gets dropped on there and gatsu gets the bag so there's game number one game number two went for scav guy landed in front of me they're in here somewhere they got a gun cracked in there with a couple nice head shots finished them off okay not a bad start although they did get this gap now there was a firefight in this bunker and i wanted to mop them up so pro next to the tires here nice and dark never going to see me i didn't make any noise and that is a easy beam as the meta balcon skin runs out there and dies good not a bad start but i am all the way out in miller nowhere in the military base this guy is going for the buy i've got a stun luckily nearly kills me get the tag get the flank nice okay we've got it i don't know why maybe they were just coming over to buy their loadout or something a bit more money for me precision airstrike from the bunker come on dude is that really necessary and here you're about to see what's happened to the cold war horde it's got more recall on it than i've had hot dinners obviously they nerfed it but that particular blueprint is not good for warzone it's just got so much recall man but got the kill on the guy in the bunker lovely loadout drop i'm feeling safe there's already been a little firefight here i don't think there's anyone else guy comes back for more that's an easy mag 10 being right there well they were a bit squirrelly on the ground there you know maybe if they'd have picked up a gun they could have killed me but there it is and i've got the strela look what's behind me just noticed at the last second big boom lovely strelikel get rid of one of the trucks out of the game not many solos anymore but the ones that are there you've got to get rid of and it happened to me random guy behind a dragon's teeth on the airstrip has an rpg of course they do why wouldn't they fair play hiding behind the dragon's seat there i'm in the gulag getting pretty annoyed at this point you know yeah i just want to get i want to get the victory royale for the video but bear in mind that this is sunday evening eu so it's full swear like this is spmn to the max it hurts but sometimes i'm okay with it and my weapon is a crossbow yay missed the stun because he decides to not jump out i'll go for a shot the second i aim in and shoot they move i'm chasing i'll go for the flag c4 they jump out the window and then because they've got the weapon in their hand they kill me quicker than i can kill them with melee i'm hanging my head in shame you can't see it but that's what i'm doing okay game number three the final game can we win one match of war zone solos on a sunday evening this guy by the way just wanted to be a plant pot i suppose or a plant depending on your proclivity what would you prefer and they turn into money for some reason it must have been the blueprint but i headed over to train station i wanted to see if i could get some more loot random rose skin on the roof you're just going to die on your mp7 on a headbutch like that that's perfect distance as well and i heard a footstep here 10 meters i wasn't sure if they were on the left or the right because that heartbeat was a bit weird but that confirmed that they were in here i just went overkill popped the daddy that guy has not been happy with that but man that mp7 shred you and you get that kind of distance little fight was going on here blip on the heartbeat i wanted the kills it's how i play solo you know me [Applause] camper in the roof started chewing but just messed it up turned on 180 get the zombie out again get a backflip a zombie backflip i bet you've never seen that in the warzone video have you you only get that here like the video guys please please like the video leave a comment leave a comment below anyway so one more guy here on heartbeat i wasn't sure if they were on the roof they were clearly downstairs nearly kill me throw the semtex so i can stop them pushing while i use the zip get out there fast i'm gonna recharge here get the place back on i'm feeling pretty safe so i glide off the roof get my load out get that swiss best sniper rifle in the game by far right now and that other load out there that must have been the row skin on the roof now here's where it goes full cdl it's twitch rivals lobby and i wanted to wait for the rose skin so i could kill them on the loadout attack rover comes up behind me and that dude didn't know i was there and i got the kill with the mp7 even at that distance manny it is actually good now go back to it try again the jeep comes over and that isn't the rose game because the rose skin if you know it's justified a shot at them from twins so i'm scoping in and i want to kill that player because i know they're good because that little firefighter that i had with them but while i'm scoping him the guy in the jeep jumps out and it turns out that they're a really good player too and they just beam the hell at me while i'm behind this tree i'm trying to use my airstrike i know i've got it in the bag can i get a chance to put it down i pee put it down they still continue to shoot they try and move the jeep it gets stuck they have to jump out airstrike misses it's full serpentine crowd sliding from this guy but then notice look at the quad bike on the mini map someone picks that up there's someone else here guys someone picks the quad bike up goes towards cdl slidey boy down there and i wanted to push now that's my opportunity they're going to be reloading maybe they've been hurt a bit and they peek at me through the smoke they get the first shot on me the mp7 just beats them doing work i get sniped out from the hill yes the train though covers me someone else drops in at the top i can see this guy scoping at me load another bullet in the chamber with the swiss get that kill it's just is this warso is this mad max like what's what's going on my heart's peeing right now right like because i know this is uh this is a good game play you guys want to see this kind of thing if i could go ahead and win this game brilliant it'd be great yeah maybe i'd post it as a video yeah i am posting it as a video but i mean you'll see what happens jeep behind me absolutely banged him there with the swiss and i just wanted to go i'm getting out of there right getting the sakura over get out this is so annoying you see the mini map there's a 4x4 it looks like they're on top of the hill so i get my c4 out there's actually a player on top of the hill the 4x4 was in the tunnel guys i was ready to throw the c4 let my guard down random guy on top of the hill takes me out that one really hurt i was so confused and i watched the footage back and i was like oh okay i just got ruined by the mini-map and just the timing of everything but it is what it is you got to let it go right in the gulag i can come back from this we can still post this gameplay it's going to be fine so i did a bit of fishing with my tactical and lethal there waiting to see if they make the first move boom they go on the flag easy kill in the back we're back in the game right so i go all the way to the south of the map i'm gonna get away from everyone there's not really any decent contract so i went to the south of the map and apart from that rpd and this stoner everything everything's been looted it's all gone and out of nowhere i hear a footstep batman and let's take a look at the kill cam yeah in a building waiting by a window hey jump out and ruin me with the milano oh pain it is pain isn't it it's what the title of the video is pain warzone is pain i enjoyed it like even though you know i didn't get any wins today those three matches they were entertaining i thought there was some decent firefights in there and this guy heard a footstep there by the way they're the dude that killed me i get ruined by a guy in there but we've got some entertaining firefights maybe some funny moments in here and i hope you guys found this entertaining and the winner
