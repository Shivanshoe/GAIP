we're gonna be checking out battlefield portal playing for a couple hours and i thought we'd just go through each classic map and game mode and see how we fare maybe we'll start with 1942 bct i'm feeling a bit of bc2 maybe also big thanks to ea for sponsoring this one today game is linked down in the description below if you want to check it out for yourself now i've changed a few settings in my config file there was a tweet going around to enable directx 12 and turn depth of field off so i've done that hopefully we can get a bit more frame rate today so i might actually turn some of my graphics up a bit and just see how it is to start with um so we'll just go with that because these remastered or remade maps look awesome so i'm looking forward to this and i'm joined by a special guest today i probably hate the fact that i call him that uh mr jacksepticeye let's see if he's there hello sean hello you are live on the internet don't say or okay i'll say nothing don't say anything i'll just stay quiet for the whole stream oh my god so um porcelain what what do you want to do first do you wanna do the classic 1942 bad company two but a bf3 what are you feeling um well i have never really played in 1942 okay so we could start with that but i am partial to by company two and three oh you're quite partial to you yes all right then we'll we'll do uh 1942 first no dilly dallying no dilly dally in here mate let's get straight in there it's so weird hearing the characters now in the game because it's like the classic sounds i love the bad company too like russian voices and then at the end it's like man i hardly cracked the sweat yeah it's bit weird isn't it they said that to each other in world war ii as well i hardly cracked the sweat oh man that was no problem what class are you going i don't know these classes are so weird i picked the anti-tank and realized that i had a rocket launcher as my main yeah that's how the class was in 1942 that's all you had bizarre um i'll be a scout why not cheeky scout cheeky scary i could go i'll go salt then where should we spawn dude i might be one right now because it's being destroyed but oh yeah i'm not good i'm gonna die immediately no you'll be fine so you can prone in classic 1942. you can't do that tactical sprint though we now control the majority poppin dudes you're sniping everyone oh look at the giant bomber it's so awesome i love that thing oh man the size of that oh i've been sniped oh i i was looking i got sniped as well looking at it that's entirely my fault i do apologize i'm sorry he got us killed um let's spawn at oh we've got a squad member there it's one of that squad member maybe we can have a fight over sure come on oh god he's just constantly in combat he did just yeah i joined and got graded i've got myself a sherman tank if you want to hop in yeah i need to change my class i'll bring a wrench someone else just jumped in sean i do apologize ruined ruined game over games aren't what's the play to play hang on you could you could just get on top of the tank how about that i'm offended i'm running all right oh wait he's out he's out kill him i think he's scared of the snipers so if you jump in real quick is he baiting what's he doing what's he hey okay is he watching the stream because it sounds like he knew what to do he's an actor i kind of feel bad he's just stuck out there in the desert now it's okay i left them with a bottle of water oh okay to our left prawning is that what is that oh nice why are they just out in the desert like this there's a storm in it boom let's go did you get him yeah he did got a tank shelter over there oh he's sniping from over there somewhere oh yeah he's running you can't run from us oh that's a tank i got sniped out of the tank no way buy another tank it's okay i got five seconds i've got it's underbelly yes destroy him are you on me now oh i mind you get over here watch the sniper i'll try and not stand still okay probably not very good for your health is it no you got to keep moving don't want any blood clots oh oh that's the mine he just put mine down look at this guy he's cheeky i just keep getting shot out of him he sniped again i just keep getting the machine gun everything no it's okay as long as you're alive the dream is away you can just keep spawning on me forever and dying forever this is how we win sean yeah this is real war oh he's got us with the bazooka and 1942 was scary it's tough out here dude um b1 yeah we're losing b1 and a1 okay let's go there let's go oh that's uh that rock it's one of those special cloaking rocks oh beautiful about that in one garand yeah does it make the thing it sure does that means can i see if it does it can i hear the ping if you shoot all your bullets off oh i didn't do the ping for me oh i'm in ping city over here oh you're living the pink dream what we've got this point now yeah too busy listening to him ah pinging oh it's a tank behind you on the right as well as infantry oh ruined now there is another tank there although what if i switch to antitank engineer yeah i think you're right about engineer you know you were playing this engineer then weren't you charlie you've got the you've got the mines and you've got the dynamite yeah it's kind of ridiculous um i'm not a fan of the i'm not a fan of like dmr type weapons though yeah bit tricky to use i just got murdered that's war baby i like how on the map that all the planes are like modern jet fighters yeah they haven't got the ui for the old planes let's put a spray on that thing i'll deploy i don't know what class to be i'm terrible at this game i mean this was like when it came out it really was revolutionary nothing else like it at the time this is the first one right yeah very first battlefield although there was there was a game before it called operation eagle which was made by a lot of the same developers but it wasn't battlefield i see i wonder if we can get one of the big planes b17 oh let's go to a1 maybe oh whoops that's fine oh my god the thompson kicks like a mule it's got a lot recall on it yeah i'm gonna have to see my chiropractor after this i'm reloading i'm reloading i just keep spawning in and dying this is very funny that's the 1942 experience right there that's why 2042 plays like that every time i spawn in i'm just shot from a million different directions can we call oh because this is classic you can't call in the vehicles yeah and i it's also weird how i was playing bf3 and you can set up your like tactical your t menu thing but it doesn't work in the game that's strange so you whatever you want to equip it has to be like on the lowest part of your thing it's allies well done chaps bonkers what do you want stop shooting me it's one of those paid actors again we paid you to play the game drink your capistre make us look good on the right down here got him there's a guy on top of the hill it's playing the classic music as well there's rocks crumbling down hey you can't reload the m1 garand unless you fire all the shots [ __ ] that body did we win yes hey that was thanks to us yeah all thanks to us the whole 10 minutes that we were in the match we did that i am not over confident on the end of this that guy didn't say anything for me they all have the same voice they're all from different parts of the world well well well it's great being a german soldier i do like the music though it's very nice how did i do in the round no idea look at the scoreboard oh wait [Music] scoreboard sorry scoreboard sorry [Music] is it the bulger now the bowl of the bulge but a little you still got a nice caspian border picture there like that it's never changing best map in battlefield history that's a bold statement am i wrong no well a lot of people would agree with you yeah it's a good map i mean what could top it um maybe strike at [ __ ] and did you play bf2 oh no that was a good one wait they brought carrick and back for another one didn't they yeah for bf3 they remade it no caspian border just had that perfect flow always bouncing from objective nice mix of infantry land vehicles and air vehicles as well for sure all right then so oh you've got the mp40 here's the medic are you gonna play sniper again maybe i say is i don't like dmr type weapons and then oh yeah i pick a sniper i mean you could the car 98 is pretty strong and i'll try it out why not okay i'll go medic and if we if we go down already this map is so pretty though i literally can't rest people in this game can i i just remembered up in the shotgun up there you're in the windmill are you making bread friendly forces are targeting an objective sorry i guess that's what people do in windmills isn't it why are my yes why are my bullets not killing anybody were bullets different back then i think so they find like nerf things at each other just firing like cheese puffs oh ruined cheese puffs little watsons coming out of your gun have you ever received a package and it has those little packaging things in that look like what sets but they're not yellow you mean packing peanuts yeah have you ever tried to eat one oh of course actually tastes like a what's it i'm not kidding you know maybe that's how they make what's it just get a package off amazon actually no who am i kidding amazon would never use those where are you jack what are you doing i'm coming up in the tiger tank because that windmill is annoying me i'm gonna kill three dudes in it and it's still full hold on is that an enemy tank there's two tanks over there and a machine gunner i mean this guy's played the game before i need an engineer i think i'm gonna die oh he got me oh my god ow wow ouch oh i mean we could try and go to b maybe yeah i need to change class i think okay yeah the graphics on this map are definitely feel like my game is running a bit better too i don't know about you after that tweet that's just 1942. yeah it could be i just had more ideas back then there's like six people on this map silly bollocks let's go it is me your german friend let us go that's a nice looking mp40 three guys four guys five guys geez oh my you weren't lying it was like i thought i'd order a burger over there those five guys this is like the dark souls of battlefield it's so difficult i mean literally i peeked for a split second instantly there oh my god i'm bored now here comes the boss i can hear them oh there's two dudes jumping down next to you don't want to start the dark souls music you died are you still alive oh nevermind there it is ruined did you play elden ring did you get one hell yeah the network test yeah they have taken all of our resources [Music] at first because i'm such a fram and i thought the open world was a little wonky at first but the more i played it the more i liked it i mean i didn't like bloodborne when i played it first either because it was too different to dark souls and then it's my favorite game yeah super fun you know what we need we need a plane or something there's a tank there we need a plane without the e a plan yeah that'd probably work as well what about this tank i know it's been destroyed has it oh it's that bug so sometimes the tanks are on the map even though you can't use them was there no spotting in this game back then no because that would make sense why it has the 2042 system i don't know where to go honestly i don't know what to do here we just seem to be trapped in yeah unless we get a smoke grenade or something kind of getting spawn camped so look at the map we've got some people capturing c right now if we capture that point we can redeploy on that and then we can actually see the rest of the map because there is an entire level here would you believe it sean i don't believe it there's a river in everything there's some more trees oh i'm popping heads i got some health for you if you want thank you i'm single-handedly holding this line i feel like they've changed the guns in this as well like they they've tried to mimic that old school feeling no it's stalled there's a tank shooting down in them well we have a guy next to it but he's not pushing into the point and the guy who's on it is now dead damn it that was our one chance there's two guys there come on get on that point boys why this guy is are you seeing what i'm seeing uh this guy is standing around with his his willy in his hand hmm no they're both there instantly dead do you think these people playing this i've been playing bf1942 for the last 20 years and that now they're like yes finally it's my time finally my time i can't believe i'm just gonna i'm just gonna pad my stats and sit and spawn and snipe people everyone's in combat i'm glad we have so many tickets to go still i would love to see the rest of the map let me tell you there's a whole church and everything down in this other region we're just getting spanked okay we're going to systematically kill everyone here everyone seems pretty clear oh get wrecked nice i think our characters are speaking to each other it's something in german i wish i knew oh what a shot yeah i feel like we need to be anti-tank yeah this is good though look at this we've not made it this far yet let's go yes we can do this i believe our forces i'll take out my binoculars i'll help oh there's a bunch of guys who are right oh ruined they're everywhere come on that's good though that's good sent back home back to the start what if we do hang on on the left is there an enemy tank there's oh there's a like a willy's jeep or something over there there's some sort of vehicle he's way in the distance oh the drop of this is nuts it's quite satisfying getting those sniper head shots it sure is [Applause] i'm trying to hit this tank but i have to kind of like shoot at the sun for it to drop far enough because of the bloody drop it's crazy okay our guy has a tank he's pushing up let's stand by okay right that's going to blow up instantly hasn't it entry half track if it regens health there's a chance i don't even know it killed me okay can i go through the river are you kidding me ah i'm assuming that's no that's a no that's a hard no right there come on boys this is it the problem is that as soon as they know we're over here they just spawn here and you destroy us we just have to be bare sean this is like playing them it's like playing rush on metro and bf3 again or everyone's just in hallways blasting the [ __ ] out of each other and no one knows what's happening but everyone just has a smile on their face and they're all ranking up in the shack in the barn oh i can steal their tank here i can steal their tank let's go yes okay this is it this is this is actually how we win the comeback is there a guy in here i think so yeah well there was maybe he's dead i mean we got the point yes now we just have to bleed 700 tickets easy there's a guy behind that tree there but he's no longer behind the tree i'm i'm leaving i'm gone are you going up to that point war is hell then d or e if you can get a tank though that's gg steal one of their tanks i'll give you a boost here watch hopefully for any fire's not on there you go look at that super speed for like all of 10 yards okay on the left sniper dead are you able to destroy any of the walls in the church um i'll try hold on oh just get right there same place for the snipers i'm gonna reload this okay what if we just go to e now let's just go to e that would be lovely that's not nice now i feel like the destruction's been toned down a bit as well i mean you couldn't really destroy anything originally on this map so maybe they've just copied that yeah i was gonna say is destruction a thing that's been in it since the beginning they don't from what i recall they didn't have any destruction in 1942 yeah because it seems to be everyone talks about it in bad company too just hit a tree you go you can have that mate look they are starting to lose men okay i'm on the point this is good that tank is a that's a problem very scary okay we're pushing in the gang's all here i can't switch to my pistol it won't let me switch to my pistol oh god live jack i'm coming in anti-tank i'm very dead listen oh we got b and d now sean look at that game overlaps just pack it in just let us win might as well okay spawn we're shaking the other one as well excellent that was dirty okay we've got a nice tiger tank here i can help i can repair you there's a sniper in that building right there i'm going to keep vesseling this tiger time sauce oh we can see one now as well this is this is it it all looks so destitute and we thought we were ruined look at this other parts of the map wow incredible whoa a house it's not just a field and a windmill 1942 was so diverse okay screw those tanks over there hey i can repair you stay still tiger's eye no can you repair can you repair me jack yeah yeah emotionally attacking one of our objectives does that help thank you my nose is fixed if only it was that easy oh we're losing b1 and d1 we now control our majority there's a guy behind you here sean oh he got me i've got revenge for you guys put some mines down here oh we have to go back we have to go back kate [Music] i can hear a whole armada coming after me oh they've all got clogs on haven't they oh that tank is almost dead we are assaulting an objective we are salting an objective a bit of seasoning don't forget the pepper and flank yes yeah they're pretty good and i need some repairs on this the guy behind that tank there i'm gonna jump out and repair this i'm trying man there's just so many we now control sector good right look i've got one of their tanks again i got the sherman nice i'm in all right where should we go a1 that's the point that we need guy here he's dead instantly ruined i got on the left i just keep getting sniped out of it it's because i keep standing still i'm sorry it's fine okay if you're spawning me again we're gonna have to put my health and put my helmet on apparently oh the physics on this don't quite make sense i spawn in and you're sideways hold on i can do it you're also on fire oh yeah now i can't i've learned my lesson i can't go across the river thank you oh the tree titan he's scared i don't like him we need someone to repair us really yeah teamwork in a battlefield game okay across the bridge we'll take a1 plus we can take that to our right we have a friendly here oh up on the left i'm scared that i i don't want to stop at all because she'll get sniped again and i hate when that happens you know oh this is dynamo on us sean get him get him he just casually run up to us put some dynamite on goodbye we don't have any friends apparently watching our backs um that's good though look we split him down the middle here yep perfect okay so spawn let's go to a1 again we've got pins and blue maneuver going on here oh the music's kicking in the hitch in the oh they're coming up the hill as well on the right this is awesome i hate when they run just stand still yeah i like that you don't look so good i'm very dead why does this music sound like something from predator it is a bit predator isn't it they just copied it i mean the f942 came out in 2001 i think so waiting think about 1942 [Music] unfortunately not oh you're all dead oh we're losing day one there now spawning let's go spawning right right there yeah i'm in the church i can hear him [Music] so much kickback in this garden kind of like boss music as well on an old snes game wasn't [Music] it's getting quite dramatic now i keep just funny they're gunners that's what happens to you yeah it's so easy i wonder if we're gonna make a comeback we have 11 tickets versus their 530. as long as none of us die ever again every day the most even this is over we are focusing on oh gg gg wins how many kills did we get 30 that was my contribution 33 oh baby oh you know i think i pulled the lips don't move either [Music] it kind of sounds like a light-hearted patrick warburton hey why did we push them back yeah it does now you now you've said that i can't only hear that now okay bf1942 done should stay in 1942. bad company too you're still in the party yep excellent well i think so welcome to the party pal did you just mix irony with bruce willis yeah why not oh no i'm heading into el alamine apparently no that's not right okay is it stop now nope make it stop i'll back out just make it stop make it start stop oh hell yeah i got an svk dude that is the best gun in the game i'm not kidding it's a two-shot dmr oh really yeah to the chest don't even need to get a head shot i actually have to hit people if i want that yeah are you good at that are we still in a party okay yeah i think we should be searching now right yep cool hope you enjoyed the stream guys vandy thank you for the 10 free mata thank you for the five and mahin thank you for the five jack playing with jack who's the real jack here well who knows erica harbor this is where the fun begins blackjack squad look at that we got three jacks in a squad hell yeah oh yeah the rounds are just starting as well i think perfect yep right all the music and everything man i just love this is the first battlefield game i played so i have a soft spot for all the sound effects i love the russian voice actors in this game we must hold our ground defend our objectives and fight harders on the enemy fight harder than the enemy you seen that the grenade's got the smiley face on it as well yeah i love it tank coming where's the tank straight down the middle i'll try and help with that double tank there he is there one one left tank is cover from the other tank that shot went right through the fence is the other tanks that are alive oh yeah he's coming way left zombie now these people have played bad company too before they're vets i think break these down yes oh tank's dead man the time to kill in this game is so high unless you have a tank are they done they get past us is it clear in there i'll blow blow some holes jumped out he's ruined it one of our guys is here nice boom oh it's so cool that you can play this now just with modern controls and performance and graphics i miss it i kind of wish they just i've been c4 james that's battlefield baby i can't believe you've done this fair play switch those around everything is just unlocked by default yeah well weren't there like perks in this game um yeah i think you i think you have them you just can't pick them they're just pre-selected i see those guys heading to be see if we can defuse it i'm heading in there's a lot of spread on the guns oh my goodness here's the bitket you're diffusing oh my god there's so many dudes here oh i got it you did you defuse it but i was dead you got those special hands watch the hands over here oh yes i love that sound what the the sound of the yeah it's just iconic isn't it really feels like home i need some ammo do you have ammo no if you want it can i pick that oh g53 let's go hey we're doing a good job here yeah defending is so hard on this map oh there's another time coming i think holy ghost the second you there's three tanks going look at that look at that oh my god okay we're ruined this is like a campaign mission and this experience has been a lot better instantly than the 942 experience yes i actually killed people health again here's some for state take it now these tanks we're gonna need some anti-tanks like are we screwed here i don't think we have any oh [Music] nice with a guy with a rpg here not they should try and get around the back of b there's a tank there but they need infantry marking location of crystal tank careful he's destroyed that time oh there's a guy here in the building got him got him nice health down here oh hey i know i saw it happen on my screen and then i got up on your screen but not mine no stop i'm gone no it's fine we might lose this one now yeah look they're all over that that's crazy go engineer was there uh ttv buddy thank you for the 20 how are you playing already you can get it if you've got early access on ea ea play they all get like tunneled coming down that construction site area going to fix your other nose they are coming yes oh i can smell the daisies again i think we need to be hard pushed up on that construction site yeah one of you can play this in conquest dropping down here and so many oh too many i need to put a sigh on yeah i wish that the the ui for like changing customization was the same as the games they're from as well it's a bit awkward this system isn't it yeah i get that it's a lot more work to do that though all right let's do it let's do this is that a vehicle just went past sure was got him nice job those guys dropping down on b going up to the roof here oh there's guys in the construction site behind us whoa because of the amount of spread on the guns that fire works quite well oh he just planted here oh that was the guy oh and now i'm on fire cool thank you for the rest what's going on i have no idea people dying everywhere ep oh that was a good sound [Music] dead i mean there's a sniper on top who could literally just walk down the stairs and kill this guy there we go he took the kill cool i need to switch to the xm8 xmas awesome yeah do you know this is the the first pc game i played really this is the game that taught me how to use a mouse and keyboard that's cool you're on console before i assume yeah i only got a gaming pc like 10 years ago what consoles did you have growing up all playstation mainly i was a bit of a snob when i was younger because i couldn't afford an xbox so i had to hate them did you so you didn't have uh n64 nope oh i missed out on so many games that everyone else has played mel gets solid though i mean come on yeah like something like that that formed a lot of who i am that's why you wear that weird mask and try and infiltrate people's heads with your braid yeah that's why i keep talking like this so i keep calling you meryl every now and then oh there's a lot of infantry coming in here no no no no oh you've got a nice position there a humvee just zooming by oh the xm8 has like no recoil all right can we get blank in here oh i'm ruining everyone's day nina that was good impression they're pushing my [ __ ] they said that in bf3 as well didn't they yeah i think so dang it i ran out of ammo i couldn't stop him he's got my building i think [Music] sorry i don't know they used to say something like that i didn't speak russian no did we lose it yeah they've only got 15 tickets we can do this this is our last bastion here sean come on good shooting he's down changing magazines bang oh god they're coming in sean i'm super dead 10 tickets we have to hold them we can do this i mean they have to come in yeah they have to come down ground floor so oh there's no hit right there coming in one guy's on it got him another guy downstairs under the stairs oh he's got me no they're planting it there's like two tickets come on you kidding me we have to stop them here oh no one's a spawner three tickets they've got where'd you come from we've got to get in there sean brian reloading oh god rpg me oh yes wow well played first in revives and i just did three valuable team players well there i am look at that get that dirt off your shoulder you get it off everyone else is holding me back is this us we were third not bad not bad the bad company to your boy band god that's instantly just way more fun yeah valparaiso next nice i think erica harper's one of my favorite maps ever oh it's great yeah [Music] what's your favorite battlefield map oh it's difficult oh you like battlefield name your favorite map all of them no no there's been some bad ones um i really like quentin scar from bf1 i think that's a great battlefield map um caspian border it's got to be up there grand bazaar on bf3 for the infantry fighting oh that was so fun uh down the van peak rush just because of the base jump yeah you fight through that first bit at the top of the mountain and you did the base jump down that was super fun siege of shanghai was pretty good yeah yeah especially for attack helicopters um the revolution of that was fun nanche's strike on bf4 as well with the boats and like one big island in the middle lots of islands outside it and you could go in the attack boats the helicopters the jets okay so we okay we're defending again is it time to snipe go for it i'll be your uh i'll be your med kit okay that music sting's awesome yeah they've got a helicopter don't they defend their objectives of the enemy there it is there it is hostile helicopter are they just phone into the ground yep okay it's ruined oh thanks here oh god they pushed hard and fast something off about the sensitivity with the mouse it feels weird yeah i saw a video of like changes you can do we're like changing some values of the controller as well to like match okay and people are saying some controller options we're [ __ ] up the mouse i don't know if that's just placebo effect but um i might be i don't know why controller options would have an effect though unless it's bugged or something yeah well there's like a uniform aiming option yeah turn off and on again i don't know try turning it off and then again i think people are just looking for fixes yeah it just feels a bit inconsistent to me i feel like the sensitivity changes a lot yeah well there's there's a whole bunch of options now like zooming speeds and like zooming sensitivities and smoothing when you go in and out and i think too many variables what killed you um there's a man down there did you find him yeah there's two there's a lot of people around you know oh that tank is a problem yeah i'm gonna switch to an engineer wow ow oh it's a bradley of course i wish i could see if there are any medics around when i'm oh there we go come on let's go let's go yes basically avoid the tank at all costs unless your hands down yeah he's really weak though did he get him holding back are they on the water side over by bay who was attacking me then helicopter uh excuse me my bullet just went through that man's face [ __ ] our guy's hit cover me reloading there's something a bit funky with the head wrench you don't say whoa what these helicopters doing dude they keep wasting them you went for the knife oh get wrecked there's some guys there yeah we gotta wait now until we push back oh no they didn't get a i thought they got hey many people coming down here can't go down broseph johnson so i'm not doing much from here oh the gol my baby oh that's what i'm using so fun i'm done forget about me stop you stay in the fight so you can't yeah you can't pick like the mortar for sniper anymore yeah you used to be able to use your binoculars and call in a motor strike i don't know why they haven't got that shame that was really fun yeah oh so many dudes that was a mistake it's kind of fun how like they've mimicked their movement so you can't prone you can't do the stray sprint yeah it just feels fine like it's okay it's a little smoother than original bc2 from like a first person perspective it feels smoother i feel like i'm playing wars on here shooting people out of the sky marking position of tango positive id yeah i i swear some of these shots should be hitting but they're not um cover me reloading oh i hit the tiny metal beam in front of the tank [ __ ] oh that tank is one shot i can't do much about it they're behind us now behind a gotta reload that stinks i shot two rockets into that tank and i get no assist for it what they've been robbed no oh oh a whole bunch of you guys just went down there i can hear someone running with the defense let's go yes thank you i'll make sure there's so many here what the hell all right left oh that was a nice flight right there ruined us it's always it always surprises me how easy they're able to like sneak in yeah yeah forget me when we try and do it we just get instantly spotted and murdered straight away yeah don't waste your time keep fighting what's he doing pokemon go isn't that isn't that the binoculars um they're in but i think you can only spot with them i don't think you can do them all the thing oh sometimes maybe they'll add it i mean if they keep building on portal adding stuff they could add functionality like that turns out 2042 will just be the game that has every battlefield game in it dude i mean i'm up for it it's not a bad strategy honestly i want them to get a bit wacky with it as well do zombies and pirates and dinosaurs and you know let people really make some crazy modes yeah that'd be fun here we go that was solid defense there excellent they didn't even get the first point oh you know i think i pulled something back there well well well hey some more american russians well well well that was fun it's so weird they have a great uh english program in this game hey first place hey look at us you would have thought keeping them up by not me okay so someone in my chat is saying you can use the motor strike but i mean how like i didn't really see a way of doing it yeah don't you say you can do it tell us how you just can okay it just works it just works um okay bf3 sure this is cool i like this doing it in order are we going to get no shar or caspian border first uh caspian okay i believe i want to sit and then oh there we go i want to sit in the aaa and just take jets out of the sky our aggressiveness is paid off okay they're telling me how to do it now you have to change the gadget to the c to the mortar you replace the c4 in bc2 oh oh baby look at all these guns what class you gonna play assault of course okay m16a3 uh i have the m4 okay i'm gonna be that guy and go with the m16 a3 oh my god this ui oh so many guys so many guys so many guys that was a mistake heavy barrel there we go yeah see that i don't want to change now because i set up the m4 so i don't want to waste half my day setting up a second one you have to be mensa level to do it quickly this was the one that the m16 was great in right the m16a3 was broken af when yeah three launched uh yeah i thought that that was i thought that was bc2 for some reason bc2 is the one where it sucked this was like burst fire right um yes but it's full auto in this you would go m16 for grip heavy barrel and it just had no recoil they've got the og voice lines in okay oh it's so good to hear that i think there's a lot of people here grenade out [ __ ] i assume you're rocking the cobra site um i've got the yeah the red dot sight i don't know if kobesite's in this yeah it is is it okay it says it was but i picked it now it's just a red dot i've got the rds ruined my only complaint is that it sounds different yeah it sounds crappy that again oh sorry sorry friendly's attacking an objective in sector delta that and an94 used to be one of my favorites because it's so punchy yeah the a knife was great we're losing c i think there's a tank here somewhere one thing i'd like to test on this map in the original bf3 the tower fell at the end of the round but then in bf4 they made it so you could trigger it but i don't know can you just go and destroy it in this or something you can't you have to wait till the end of the round it was the first thing i tried i'm getting destroyed it's all hardcore players on bf3 grenade i feel like there's a lot of people around this show yep i'm gonna die here hey man here's your match i hear footsteps so it's a clog sorry everyone will clogs in bathroom do you remember clogged warfare i just saw you like awkwardly crawl around that corner and just go i heard i feel like they took out a lot of trees here as well yeah it's a bit different use the med kit get your med kit oh this time to kill is so nice do you think the next call of duty now will do this where they just bring all the games into one i mean they could that's the thing though like if dice and a actually put some money into this and and pad it out it could be huge but yeah it depends you know what their strategy is with this game in the next game i don't want to just ditch it like this has got so much potential geez i'm done again like if you think about let's say bf1 or bf5 those maps from a graphical standpoint still look really good so they could support those and just put them in this and there you go like there's a load of maps in portal that you didn't have before [Music] oh the trade i feel kill it's really hard to see my red dot it blends in a bit doesn't it also those rez's are really broken it says i was revived by jack franks and i'm still on the ground i'm in the infinite death loop this is the afterlife now shawn i i literally can't do anything i'm just stuck i can't respawn oh you literally can't do anything no it says 31 seconds to revive and it's frozen where's your body uh on the base of the skip okay let me go over there next to this it says i was revived by you but i wasn't hmm interesting um why the skip yeah on the left hand side when you come up the hill i'm trying to get up there i keep getting killed stay in the fight i think you might be bugged or something then hold on yep i mean i've seen other people talk about it okay or you just get stuck in a death loop i can see your icon enemy forces are attacking one of our maybe this is a champion i can't i can't even like force respawn there we go here we go good dunk nothing i had faith that was going to work you know can can you uh exit the game and join on me yeah i'll try that this is going crazy battle royale style mode at the moment with portal because the the functionality just isn't there but down the line they could add those functions and just say to the community go on then you build the bar rail yeah we put the functions in you can put loot down but in terms of the rules go ahead and do it and the um the map as well did you play any battlefield firestorm i'm out okay so that was like their attempt at vr on battlefield 5. um but the map itself is gorgeous like really nice massive so what if they put that in portal and put some basic functionality in for about real they could i mean that is kind of the the cheat code isn't it to just let the community build what they want instead of trying to give them what you think they want yeah it's how minecraft became so successful roblox gta online as well i'm sure they're going to be surprised that well the devs themselves probably aren't but the higher ups are probably going to be surprised that these modes get played more than the main game yeah okay i couldn't join on you because it says you're offline ah that's not true leave me alone you don't worry about the enemy origin and ea games they're just a different breed they're esports ready they already supposed ready hold on um so if i leave the game should be able to invite you again [Music] we didn't even get to use the attack helicopter no oh that's gonna be so fun pc um jacksepticeye invite there we go nice nice i got to the bathroom okay hope you're enjoying the stream guys thank you for coming along today having fun it's been interesting to play through all these games they got me pinned down yes indeed no shell canals able to stream in 4k not today method we're doing 1440p today i can't run this game at 4k because the performance is just not very good this looks so much better and more fun than i thought it would yeah i mean i'm playing at just medium settings trying to get decent frame rate spast 12 acwr be advised the enemy now controls most sectors put the hollow sign on swapping around on the barrel it has to go in the center i think yeah this is so awkward this system yep and then barrel heavy barrel okay did it put you in the match yep sweet i'm going to spawn i have the cobra site in the right place and it's still just a red dot that's weird well you have it closest to the center just a bug then i guess probably is this the odd it's like helicopters here sean let's go come on hopefully no one spawns in it okay get in [Music] made it oh it's so fast instantly taking off right should we take that down [Music] uh yeah try to [Music] i don't know where that a vehicle is there have you got tv missile uh no i don't know what this is guided missile [Music] is that the tv missile yeah i think so right rail it shall unrail it i can't do anything with it oh where'd he go he's a bonus you see him no no he's a bomber's jack well the rockets are so fast yeah this feels faster to shoot as well my rockets just aren't hitting they just yes okay we are higher look how high we are get back in control we're in a different map at this point okay how many players okay this is a full server dude let's see if we can find some infantry i don't even know if i can see any from this height um there's a tank here [Music] seeing i feel like shoots way quicker than it used to oh infantry right close yes look at that sign oh yeah and i got two more beautiful this is what it's all about oh dude we're back in it now we are those guys that you hate tank down oh there's here many infantries sean take them out look they're riddling dude they're all over oh no way he got us with this s'more oh my god he's so happy about that right now did you get some you must have got a few kills on sure i got two i think i was hitting two at least who brings a small to a gunfire what the hell that was fun yeah we'll get it again if it respawns um so this is the tdm area isn't it oh yes oh my god that hit range jesus and 94 goddess forget me kill those [ __ ] they are 94 is the burst one right yeah yeah it does have a full auto mode though or it used to is it the aek the one that's like shoots extremely fast yeah although that's not in this they didn't put it in for some reason one of our objectives i don't know why oh two guys on me damn aek used to be unreal on metro yeah the rate of fire is crazy enemy soldier id our aggressiveness i'm getting big hit wrench problems on this yeah it's a bit wonky isn't it can i blow that up oh this guy right here oh there's three of them oh wait let me do this why haven't i done this to myself you need help oh he's right in front of you sean i need more than help i need an intervention hopefully that doesn't kill me you have lost control of an objective oh i am clean enough never mind no that's not true it is true i love when you skip the revive you just hear leave me alone go away it's not worth reviving me oh lord where am i we're down to half our resources now what are these guys doing i have i just see yeah they were just like shaking hands or playing rock paper scissors or something this guy's a battle going on here i don't know if you notice i went through it what the hell is happening sean there's guys everywhere this is the true battlefield now this is what we came for at least the revive uh distance is still the same yeah you do it from the different map i just remind you from caspian border bro i revived you from the last round he's a revival last week i feel like as soon as i start shooting i lose all visibility i'm here my bullets are gone there's a lot of smoke and visual recoil yeah get away let me be i'm sure they'll tweak it maybe you can just turn it off yeah perhaps we'll just play on all low i need to get out of this helicopter we are losing horribly that's fine what's he doing what is this man doing sean come over here what are you doing look at this man jiggling look at him no dude on my screen that does not look right he's like jiggling like it's made of jelly or something no he's just on a oh god that's a tank i've got a rocket launcher i'll try and get behind it jiggle man is dead no jiggle and i can't revive mr jiggle mr jiggle what the robot you already oh jack there's a hostile tank yep very much is are you getting them i'm attempting to hit him twice i'll keep spotting him so i can get okay thank you thank you goodbye nice living the dream wow they really upped the top of the tank flying off didn't they yeah that's gone this gets sent to space heat oh i feel like we're walking into hell up here that's fine stay the [ __ ] down dude the acwr is nuts okay you can hear some clogs again yeah why can i hear our feet just as this everyone loud clogs shoot that skip i just get destroyed a little bit man i think they get dented or something yeah control the majority of the sectors nice work nice work friendly forces nice work the big reach around coming in through the back door and i get across here beautiful where are we we're under there's a tank here somewhere i think i know he's gone oh that's a friendly amtrak why would you ever get into that thing one of them is team deathmatch on this map wasn't it like the first videos that you did mr beast commented on them like seven years ago well before he was before mr b said before i was jacksepticeye that's crazy what did he say he just said it was fun to watch so weird have you been in a mr beast video no have you seen this doing the yeah it's crazy it's literally built the squid games the the bug beds and everything so quick dude oh tank changing mags where's the tank uh he's to the left to the right of d oh there's so many infantry over there i actually love this sean i think i think this is great honestly i love this yeah i'm just smiling like it's great smiling playing a video game in 2020 what you smile and play battlefield you don't even go on reddit and complain about it that's true what am i thinking kill that tank i need um i need some rockets a real engineer would find a way you have a repair tool don't you that's true actually i just feel right at home here you know ah cut down in my prime i saw that i can't go anywhere i'm pinned all right spawn at me and then you can hit the tank okay [Music] oh there's two tanks oh lord i'm trying to max [Music] should we save the attack kelly's back yeah enemies moving on an objective in sector charlie can we upgrade our weapons in portal john um no everything's just unlocked by default in portal oh that's not that's the other one yeah let's just wait and see if it respawns i think that's what everyone's trying to do this guy is looking at mars very nice at least he has a spawn beacon down on our spawn he's just sniping living the dream oh that heli sounds awesome i mean people did this in between as well just jump in there oh go go go go go go go go go go get out get out oh no hold on just don't take off cuddle back the yeah this is what you do don't you hold on how do i actually type to my team cuddle bear i have a friend please can you jump out thank you i couldn't have done it politely than that we're taking heavy losses and resources are scarce he's not listening maybe maybe you can't read i hate being this guy though like i think we should just let him have it yeah cuddle that place oh he's firing the gun let's just hang on just wait and see what happens he could be a real battlefield player and just take the helicopter and drive it into the water frustration slide straight down be that guy come on cuddle there do something oh he's getting shot at though what if he gets sniped he's here guys he's here i'm i'm spotting him guys he's here the round's gonna be right here this guy's oh he's gonna fly let's see what happens let's see what happens see if he flies into the ground oh oh no i thought you got into the pilot seat i don't think they've flown before jack this is a jack i'm scared successful executing sector control oh i think it was gonna go backwards let's go backwards oh no he's got it he's got it interesting interesting technique let's put it down it's on the ground we're taking five damage he's just trying to kill it there's far easier ways land okay you're off again see we're gonna turn it around and quarterback what oh he said it yeah yeah in war and worried about pulling a muscle that was great i love that that's so fun everyone in chats just like that's me when i drive helis i can really literally i'm glad you're a good pilot because i'm a much better gunner i wish they had firestorm in this yes i like that map operation firestorm is great um well hopefully we get caspian again because yes there we go straight into it this has the attack helicopter on it and it's got the jets then it does the border of iran and turkmenistan doesn't have the the warthog though um oh that's a shame the a10 yeah that was sick so fun to listen to have i tried zombie mode yet jack no i haven't chung bro zombies yeah i think people have been making all sorts of game modes in the logic editor they've done like a zombies mode gun game that kind of stuff okay right so to get the attack helicopter you have to spawn in and run to it no everyone knows how to play the game sean i hate though about this tank here you won't get your headshot off this time it's one of these oh that's cool the edge of the visor is all like bendy like a parallax effect on a whatever yeah like a fisheye sort of lens let's get to a1 these tanks are so fast yeah just because you get shift a little sprint and with a boost kelly's in the air oh god hold on cheeky friendly get ready because the tank is going to come straight from e okay it always does oh what's going on i wish i could aim up a little bit more i'm hitting what's he doing oh he's right above us ah a little bit higher than i can get him well i want to shine him yes oh my god let's go god that was insane what a shot [Music] go around the back of e yeah yeah yeah [Music] these are like the tanks from 2042. yeah that's it i was trying to put my finger on it like it just sounds like an electric car or in this case an electric tank do you think they've made electric tanks yet oh they must have okay we're on the prowl here sean i like it watch out for those mines as well i forgot about those friendly's attacking a sector echo objective oh you just love destroying everything don't you oh that did a little bit of damage the game gave me destruction i'm going to use the destruction it started yes full server if you can get the jet i will give you my youtube channel oh guy coming in let's go this right here a piece to the right of it there's another guy to the left where'd he go this thing shoots so slowly that i can't oh god good job there's another guy in that building to the right as well so he's right there oh ruins come on let's cut this and then they can stop spawning here this is over behind us i hear someone behind us with clogs on yeah oh no a rocket launcher where is he going got him nice job my engineer i think i can fix this a bit hold on sector echo secured successfully voice sector control oh you could get that tank if you want i can't get it was under attack boys there's a guy in there yeah let's go to bay oh b is ours oh let's head up to d d jet nice you got him nailed it gg put that on the clips channel let's go to the left got him nice oh they're everywhere if they're everywhere good work keep it up i'm gonna go up here sean i think it's it might be an a vehicle yeah yeah oh you're so dead you're so dead unless you're saved by a c4g there's no way i can lose this yes it feels good getting those aaa vehicles because all they do is camp on this hill the entire match you just shoot the planes and attack helicopters down it's so annoying dude the sound of the tank good job with that oh they're taking eat again okay let's go about that oh there's an enemy tank oh i do not know the drop on this are you still in the tank oh no they didn't get out i hit it twice you see it what's going in behind that oh there it they've all spawned here is he's just sitting there got him nice job there's a lot of infantry on the left i'm dead some guy goes i'm just here for the sound effects i don't blame you they are brilliant can i spawn on you unreal oh i i just saw your tank on the minimap get destroyed and there's like seven red dots around you it felt like it was that attack helicopter okay so let's wait for the respawn i think it's coming back soon so you've tested trying to knock the tower down then yeah because you just hit the little concrete posts right i don't know maybe we should go and mess around with them the wires are attached to i tried it and it didn't really work oh our attack helicopters never mind let's go over there nice um yeah these things these things so normally you could just hit those in four i think i mean four it was a button on a laptop i put the uh the d point under the ground and it had a countdown on it and if it got to the bottom of the countdown it would blow up whenever it was three then you could hit these don't seem to be doing anything yeah there's a free tank on a if we want it uh yeah okay i'll be the gunner you'd be the uh driver yeah i think it's just at like 100 tickets it comes down now okay let's go where are we heading e yeah yeah he's still taking sector charlie i mean that looked like it was scripted that was a full single player mission scenario there nice oh my god my sensitivity is so bad and mine's going to take a charlie year they're everywhere i need to get out of here watch out for these engineers i can rap if we get somewhere safe there's an enemy tank in front as well hold on there behind us like rapping hit the tank twice but he's got friends he's got friends out there i used to be able to destroy this job yeah like some of the destruction's turned down for sure i don't know why we've secured most of the sectors can't even destroy the water tower what's even the point yeah remember that you could like see for the individual struts on it and it would come down yeah i can hear clock shot plugs in the building binders yeah i'm trying not to stay still don't get c ford little c4 knocking at your door the gun engineer try and get out of here without taking another shot go go go easy oh no [Music] you drop down thank you thank you all right let's go get it i hit him twice thank oh yes right in the ass max damage there's another tank behind us as well though so yeah we might be screwed here i hit that tank three times and nothing i'm repairing and that time behind us is gonna murder us yeah they're repairing the tank on b as well oh god oh there's the a8 ruined it's all over dude we have smashed them this game one of our objectives i need to turn up my sensitivity for vehicles marking an enemy tank position near your i swear they've increased the velocity on the rockets oh yeah they're it's like hit scan now there you go kobe throwing a grenade that was assaulting an sure in sector delta the enemy is down to their last reserves oh there's loads back here the skip [Music] guy to the left as well coming out of that building multiple hostiles here wow i understood that reference i can't switch kits we're finding all the problems oh we've smashed them delta smashed nice the enemies in full retreat today victory is ours black burn out blackburn that was a great round man surely we're number one squad that was fun have to be i am not over confident i was like fourth on kills oh you know i think i pulled something back there i think i know something right there hey number one let's go see bf3 is our jam we know how to do it there's solomon's theme as well coming in strong here the music [Music] feels good super fun do you want to try uh main game for a little bit i'm done yeah i literally have nothing else to do today so okay sunday you need it's sunday day off i might go for a cheeky sunday lunch later go for a roast yeah go on then what's your favorite roast what meat would you go for beef bit of beef a bit of beef bit of beef on your plate a bit of gravy yorkshire pud mate oh yorkshire pud don't go wrong that was great i loved that this makes me want to play battlefield 3 again oh i've unlocked the pp finally pp2000 yeah love that gun we get serious the pp okay conquest let's go sunday is the best day so you don't do any editing or recording usually on sunday not unless i have to yeah we've been trying to just take at least make sure we take a day off it's important you know this job is fun but the one way to make it on fun is to do it all the time forever that's my life it's non-stop then it's just work unknown error did that pop up for you no but i did see people on our squad are like popping in and out on the cards big peepee 19 but it leaves then um i think it should be loading oh yeah it still says you're in the squad double grandma oh this map so cool the russian forces penetrated egyptian airspace and is bound for an agricultural research facility i don't have to oversell its importance who are you going to play by a large barrier coordination will be key sundance why not around the level together that'd be great yes sir ep secondary what's the best gun the best gun i mean i'm not really unlocked i feel like the m5 is just the all-round assault rifle that second dmr is really good i've heard the pp's very good as well i don't know i think just because it's so new still there's a lot of people experimenting i guess so yeah i also don't know how many guns are in it there's twenty two in there what'd you mean feels very little yeah it's definitely like an underwhelming amount of guns i don't like i think they should just start adding some of the bf3 guns because why not like they could still be used in the year 2042 a lot of those weapons so i've got the pee pee but i don't have any attachments unlocked for it so let's go up here and wingsu somewhere and now you can't even team deathmatch to increase it yeah they knocked the uh xp servers let's get this just put in bots right yeah they were putting bots on one hp and just farming them feels like such a huge oversight yeah our forces control most sectors you're behind me i'm quad biking oh yeah i will see if i can wing suit onto you where are you i'm in the air above you make it look epic do the epic thing again i'm losing speed i'm just going to awkwardly fall to the ground sometimes must have a really messed up face where the amount of time they just smashed into the ground nah combat roll double sun dance same skin this is why you like wrap off this and then wingsuit what a tiny little jump yeah tiny little jump did you see the amount of air i got on that reloading hovercraft oh i hate these things short they're so overpowered target is down ow oh someone winston on the roof above me 80 degrees 70 meters away from this position all the hovercrafts oh it seems like this wall is uh very divisive for my frame rate as well just die i can't stand these things i hate them so much throw your needs at them guess what killed me another hovercraft hp hovercraft sure i've got a special treat for you what's that helicopter do not revive me leave me alone stay away okay there's a guy here right there beam him there's a bunch of guys right there yes there's another one you got him i'm getting hit markers but no kill there he is love it are you trying to back up that point look at that [Music] okay very good very good hovercraft yes finally i can get my revenge screw you hovercraft [Music] die yes that feels good yeah screw you okay up on the roof here a couple of baddies [Music] one down here as well is he prone it's a mckay on the wall and here he just grappling hooks to your death you know bug it out flying very close to those please don't hit me please don't hit me please don't hit me how did he get too off that quick i don't know cheating update let me just take a repair tour all objectives are under our control death from above let's go to eight find it e for a why is this place like an agricultural center these colors remind me of mirror's edge yeah well they also didn't make that game so oh you can blow these up both factors are now under our control i'm too busy bye losers eat my grenade tracking ow yeah you made it a long way out there do these grenades ever actually like blow up a vehicle for you yeah yeah they do we are using the anti-armor ones yeah yeah just literally throw them i mean every time i do they lock on and hit nothing um probably because they're flaring it possibly come on come on come on come on one of our objectives is under attack you're going to be behind jack sorry you're going to have to catch up i know yeah i'm slow for no man i keep forgetting that i can double sprint because we were just playing the classic games oh my god we can yeah this whole time i've not been doing it i was like oh okay i can do that give all my going up all cool style a renewable facility this is very mirror's edge in here it's a bit with butterflies and stuff a bit of cross-pollination science you know science agriculture the future not a single shadow inside this building either no they don't exist in the year 2042 shadows have been eliminated the war in shadows is over oh the butterflies are here allied troops engaging at delta ii i'm so pretty just took an objective wow all right can we sit off this i think so i just want to get higher that leads to nothing ah pain up here yes yeah i think there are infantry over there what [Music] took the nades of that and that helicopter there allied force is now holding delta sorry and they've gone i don't know what it locked on to there it goes something hey girl we should get off this roof i think probably let's throw more at it what if you could like emp special oh that'd be cool you know that guy you were playing rau yesterday yeah um at first i was like i don't really get the point but then i realized what you can do is pack helicopters and switch to like a stinger missile because when they're hacked they can't flare or anything they can't use their guns they can't flare oh yeah he's really useful actually it's just a bit a bit of a learning curve that's all lay down here there's an enemy here like right there i've got the ground though some more there i hear footsteps everywhere yeah oh there's one right here [Music] [Applause] yeah i'm getting hit mark is that sean he's running across nice i still hear so many more oh there's a ton more here is that it sounded like a whole herd of elephants it's a battalion of elephants i had a lot of fun playing mckay yesterday ow this guy in the building just killed me um got him could you come and rest medical assistant okay that may have been my fault no i completely forgot that you can raise anybody in this game classes don't matter and we're all special we're all specialists okay attack hello yes i've got it i mean okay look what i see over here sean a bunch of friends friends hovercraft friends many friends many friends many many many friends i'm over eating no i'm overheating here too hot for the server just die you stupid hovercraft please kill it look how good it is i don't understand [Music] oh there's so many on this hill got a stinger kill that one yes yes no don't lock on to me oh come on man okay there's loads there dude [Music] we need that repair tool don't we really can i just pop it if i do cheeky little peek here you get them this guy here kill this guy yes yes destruction destruction on the right below us here oh oh i got him though okay what we need to do is we need to get that but then have a repair tool yeah they're attacking one i mean you've got a lot of kills there yeah sure did i'm up to 13 now um see if we can get them off this point where are they we're kind of everywhere up on the hill here [Music] i mean this pp it's kind of like an assault rifle than an smg so it's really good does everything very overpowered have to take an a2 okay we go up here let me wingsuit over there [Music] right if i wait the first thing that can happen break your face in the wall yeah break all the things you come to this point here sean yep let's go let's go all right ready i'm just going to glide as high as i can from the exact same point and it didn't give me a prompt hey let me try again i mean i'm not exactly getting much speed there we go but there's a repel here anyway there's loads in there i wonder if i can throw a skyrim there's guys in the roof oh there's a jeep on the roof coming down oh almost made this on the roof oh that was all right i'm coming down hello oh jeep's here oh my god he crashed i thought there was a repel on this side oh yeah i thought i saw it on the way down anime shining through the wall okay let's go go go go move it oh you can see i got my six oh there's guys in here on the top no no beside the truck yeah i got one i saw you on the map mate unlucky okay nice take we got this there's another guy coming in the store why can't i hear this school dinner bell it's giving me ptsd what's the store okay oh the music's playing i thought we were end of round already it's getting oh i mean

all sorts of stuff up until the end of the new year thank you for the super chats as well and the new members renewal didn't we just play renault yes okay cancel that [Music] yeah i felt without directx 12 my fps has been a little bit better but it still chugs a bit yeah at least aiming and shooting feels a little more consistent yeah oh i haven't played this one well it's a cool map this have you seen the stupid thing you can do with a hovercraft where you can climb with buildings yeah you were being spider-man for a while the other day that's why not hovercrafts don't have enough in this game what map were we doing it on was it the desert map it was hourglass this is a good level for sundance as well lots of tall buildings [Music] unknown arrow unknown error the u.s have a vested interest in this data center in song this doesn't seem to kick you out when it does and we are out of diplomatic options hey did i unlock any attachments for this no is the answer ammunition nope i didn't unlock anything for it yet [Music] hey ramy are you streaming with your 3090 yes but i'm streaming off a different pc my gaming pc isn't doing anything but playing the game it's just the optimization's not great right now for the game [Music] olly fantastic i'm using the latest nvidia driver i know some people said that the previous one might be better but i haven't tried that yet all right let's do this and call in a the ranger is he coming no he just hasn't there we go i've got like a black skin on it as well [Music] okay so you're around maybe i should switch to like um a stinger missile or something yeah we can do that because then if you disable vehicles i could lock onto them who's jetstar your dog's so fast he's a quick boy he's a quick lady you can give it orders as well i tell it where to go go kill now i kind of wish you could hang on can i put c4 in it and tell it to run into a group of enemies and then explode can i do that to iron doggo yeah do you want to okay anti-armor grenades here disable this sean if you can hack it nearly dead look at that that actually worked great i actually worked really well oh there's another guy left does that go hang on where does this elevator go is this an elevator yeah this side under the it's a secret base i don't know secret layers he'll make it somehow he'll just follow you up top can it oh what i'm whoa i've literally never been here before look what that is this is a like a little talk talk package available okay i'm your passenger now this is so slow i'm sure it's not got much armor either hang on move to that location where's the dog at the dog oh oh this thing's gonna turn it's like those three real cars from mr bean [Music] i think so my dad used to call them hedgehog cars why because of the position in the middle wheel and you know if hedgehog was on the road it's unlucky i feel like one bump in the road is going to kill us with this thing where are we going i want to be too yeah our troops have secured an objective we're playing the objective jack we're true battlefield players what is coming on i don't know oh behind us footsteps ruined [Music] what's what are these guys doing here look we just got boris and sundance just i think you need to let go of the break there you go he found it uh there's a guy here can you ha oh you can hack people as well yeah if you hack a player and then kill them it shows you enemy players that are nearby yeah it's kind of cool they just call in a vehicle there we'll see about that [Music] i'll be fine don't remind um can you hack this can you use the bridge here oh god no quick get back here go again you hacked it i'll do the thing oh no we don't have enough speed oh no that's embarrassing almost died getting out of it all right so that's going to put it back down okay now we can make it it's like a physics puzzle yes oh we're flying apparently incoming missile what's happening who knows that's fine [Laughter] on an adventure it's gone i saw so many parts of the map that i wasn't supposed to be able to see do you think i can hack the rain probably yeah i call them stop the tornado oh all right there should be an elevator or something what the hell all right let's go up stay back can you hack that i wish can't oh so apparently you can knock this down as well this tower just shoot it let me shoot these posts oh yeah okay that's one that's two three if i throw a grenade on it yes is it going oh no oh yeah it is oh yeah it is one sec that's so cool oh wait it's just bent oh it's going it's going oh she toppling i'm not landing on someone then that is so cool dude i love that oh levolution baby there should be more of those things oh it's kind of bugging out on my screen yeah it's quite laggy now oh that's really cool i wish i like destroyed the bridge or something change the level a bit now there's big horse potential from here sean well i i have a more of a it's more of a flump than it is go straight down to b2 i'm right behind you see you in 10 minutes well there's an osprey here that thing comes down pack it okay i can't be there oh i dare it i think i can hack it i can will you knock the enemy dog yeah i just shot the back as i was doing it i wonder what that does does it just disable it i think it just stops at you interesting pretty cool if it turned it on them i'd like to i mean they are hammering us on the points here i'm dropping in you're a madman they're throwing on the reinforcements it's progress there's people here on the other side where is that guy there's someone here on the map shawn at it [Music] still two people somewhere you know this reminds me of that zebra tower map from the f3 pause pause combat yeah it's a lot naked and there's still so many areas of these maps i've never been in here before there's so many guys over on the other side i don't really want to go near them though you know oh that's pretty bubbles is that uh i can't hack it okay right i'm throwing my nades dude they're both gonna hit surely come on come on come on oh so close at the they missed rocket launcher i think they did can you see him with this you can hack it again can you [Music] yeah they're across already put the turret down so if i had a stinger there we would have easily killed that osprey i think so i'm gonna switch for sure i hear so many footsteps what's happening no stay away there's a lot of people underneath oh my god bullets why i need a faster firing gun okay i've switched was that f2 wasn't it why's it spawn me down on the ground echo objectives captured [Laughter] uh it's just you have to do it yeah four vibes i can hear her oh osprey right next to us two of them i can't i'm hacking the furthest one oh i got shot hey i got you thank you hey hacking it again something else shooting at me okay hit it then i think there's so many people above us right now yeah just turning the other building as well bit dangerous that's water baby it's poor baby right above a second harem i've never been more paranoid playing a battlefield game than i have this one well because the footsteps yeah okay i'm hacking this osprey again which one 190 degrees you get it right above us yep two grenades come on come on fire surely that's hitting it [Applause] oh disabled out of range now let's go across and get that other point because they keep spawning there okay can you not hook onto that from there you have to actually go to the top to come to that i think oh there's three guys over there is that okay let's see if i can zip across and stay alive four seconds okay i killed a couple of them sean if you spawn on me yeah scissor in combat there we go right there two people here somewhere elevator yes come on uh i'll spray here sean try and hack that that was awesome dude that works so well yeah that's the appeal of this character isn't it like you you work with your team it's kind of like behind us kind of like the the tracking dirt thing from by company too yeah what the hell okay split split between characters my mouse i can't use them i tried to provide you and now i can't move my mouse it's locked it's moving by itself very slowly it's rotating it's not my screen you look so goofy i literally can't okay hold on sorry you fixed that it just glitched out hopefully i can okay i can use it in the menu tornadoes back tornadoes but
