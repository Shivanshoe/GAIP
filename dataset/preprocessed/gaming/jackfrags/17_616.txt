today we're back on bf5 and i'm using the drilling both barrels it's been too long it has been far too long look at this thing it's awesome i couldn't find a european server because they were all full and they had massive cues on so i've had to join a us server so i've got like a 96 ping that's okay we'll make it work i thought that i would just be the shotgun guy that's annoying in the cathedral and just stay here for the majority of the round you know drop ammo as well to those indeed it's pretty good at range oh yeah i've got this thing as well what'd you call it well rod what'd you call it oh dude i'm in a weird mood today guys i'm in a weird mood it's been a busy old week oh hello no why are the sirens playing oh the red flares okay this is like a really rare weather condition on this map where it drops flares and then there's a bombing run see these red players here it's really cool it doesn't happen that often but the bombs start dropping check it out it's really atmospheric [Music] it's just like weird white smoke as well look at these bombs you can die to those bombs that's my uh my bomb sound effects there it's cool it's made this ash in the air how cool is that anyways i'm not focusing on the on the gameplay here when i need to be this little thing is amazing i just thought as well could i get the katana there's a qatar on this level it's floating it's in there you just shoot it and then it it drops out there you go and i've got a katana it doesn't make much sense but that's a video again it's fine i'm probably not even gonna get to use the katana for a kill but it's cool to have it right there's a lot of enemies out there and b leading too much come on peek again oh 70 damage nice wha wha what what yes there's the kill i'm happy i got one kill with it i don't care if i die now that's fine that's absolutely fine he's quite atmospheric like this enemies here somewhere they're capping the point look what what ah no that's the end what do you think that guy thought when he saw an absolute mad lad running towards with the katana on this map it's probably like where'd you get that from well in my time spent having fun we've lost most of the points i am a great soldier i promise is that a a tank land trooper watch it i think you just shot a flare it doesn't even do damage to it does it anyway as i was saying whilst i was messing around the enemies uh did cap a few flags back get a bit of that but it's fine see nothing to worry about i'm going to get killed by that a vehicle aren't i it's coming i know it's coming good flares there there was a guy that ran past me then did they not see me down here gotta jump in there with my shotgun no let's get that point there's no enemies on it i like these posters though that boy looks a bit worse for wear i wonder if these names are related to developers the war of terror but this is nice isn't it you got the cathedral in the background got the smoke starbucks jack frank is noob he's a console player ha ha la mao he plays on both imagine using console hi mom oh dear i like this i might leave it on pop-up see what they say it's always good fun i'm stuck dice i'm gonna hurt yeah hopefully i didn't just run past someone then entirely possible i was there mg34 over there can i even get an angle on that guy i don't know there was another one running here too this has to stop i can't stand for this reload there's so many enemies around me it's fine it's fine i'm just gonna just until they shoot me yep it's fine right i'm running out of health of course it's a it's a grenade pistol they put a spawn beacon down there i'm doing it oh man okay this is [Laughter] guys we've lost the cathedral i must enter and cleanse it remember that video i did where i was just hiding here in plain sight that was good fun wasn't it i was just hiding here right there on that pile prone like this and no one saw me and then they did the visibility update which did make a difference to be fair that was good fun i enjoyed making that video he wants it i know there's someone here that wants it short range mode engaged uh sorry it's like four guys in the corner just having a mars bar party i want to go back there can we can we not can we not do that please there are men's everywhere i can hear them i can hear all the men's i like this staircase though don't think i've ever been up

back up grenade out let's go now oh they're around over here that's where the party was i think they're still having a party i'm gonna party pooper i'm gonna crash it that's so dumb yes i mean this thing is ridiculous isn't it oh mate don't worry oh no you got reds nice there we go big flank big flank insane all right guys we've got to get on that point there were several enemies around there's
