take a look at this gun in warzone how cool is that it's a bullfrog they released this blueprint last week and i saw that animation i thought i've got to get there i just have to and with my unhealthy addiction of using guns in war zone that aren't necessarily that great for war zone of course i'm going to use this in warzone some might say that that's not a great idea but i'm always trying to push the boundaries and shake things up a bit so this is the build that i'm working with unfortunately you can't change any of the attachments on it because if you do you don't get that cool animation so we're sticking with this really interesting looking skin though so that's what we're doing today the bundle in the store is called the montezuma's curse it's a mastercraft bundle if you're interested in getting it yourself and if you do pick anything up in the cod store do consider using my code jack frags in all caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from whatever you buy as always big thanks to all these guys who've done the same with that said let's get into the game if you enjoy it guys leave a like it's a great way to help support me let's see if we can get a win right then we're gonna drop boneyard we've got one of these cows over does anyone use this there's only about six of them there a bollywood can be quite fun for solos but trios and quads it's absolute chaos there's already two people flying here m16 i do not like this version of the gun but usually okay for early game fight like this oh we got a hostile rose skin tricky one that was close that was so close jumping around like crazy rose naughty carry on doing this scav enemy uav overhead news came out nowhere no bother there hostile dropping into the area watch the skies are still dropping in that's really unfortunate simon also the fact that i found the ffa i should not have won that that is that is okay if you have to submit a clip as to why the ffa is overpowered you send them that you send them that one there's the bull frog my in addition and someone was having a little fight here it looks like they still are i didn't think i was going to get the kill there i thought he might just stand up and want at me or something i have to admit i'm not a big fan of the sight on this though that takes up so much screen space enemy team is tracking you right [Applause] you hiding behind the blue [Applause] okay i nearly messed that one up as well i thought like he was behind that blue thing there i suppose the uav is kind of delayed though right so that was uh that was nearly the end of me there who is hunting me is it you gotta be on the roof just gonna push that i think oh god the prone tactic worked objective location that wasn't the guy under me okay that is all right dude it's not bad you know that hip fire is pretty strong all the way out here it should be right there i don't see him enemy uav overhead there he is this is a bit risky but we're doing it everyone's got cell phones nowadays [Applause] chuck a nade see if i can get him bang on the money this might be the same guy from before let's just come back on the gulag [Music] i'm just full sending it this game i don't even care i think you've got it when you've got a gun like this we advise uav is bingo fuel rtb for reason what stairs hey no that was different guy i recognize that name where do we go ow where the hell did that come from was he in the tower maybe he was closing in dude absolutely toasted there shouldn't have shot me though it was uh it was rude and he's speccing me like giving the thumbs up [Laughter] i really enjoy solos i know some people i find it really tampy and boring but i don't play like that i just try and just push people i don't really care if i die it's just whatever but if you run around like this and just get refunds and go from player to player yeah sometimes there are frustrating things to happen but um most of the time i find it good fun it's going right here ground level [Music] should you be right here in the window that's why you gotta love uavs one over at storage be advised uav is pretty cool rtb for resupply little tip for these buildings by the way if you get someone at the top which in my case there is because the heartbeat sensor if you jump on the bannister and crouch you can walk up without making footstep noises when you get to the top here on that side you can check the window without having to come out i think he's behind the gas is closing in relocating behind the bricks maybe downstairs [Music] no i'm right there now this guy's oblivious i was thinking about doing the execution there but turned around no one down there is there [Music] to be safe west recall flyover uav entering the aortic superstore one over here by twins hmm what should we do enemy uav overhead oh that car is coming towards me i am so lucky right now and there's a jeep coming be advised he's back in where you going come back yes you just keep firing with this thing dude you got 85 shots get smite done by someone else though i gotta look at this again that's so cool isn't it i love that you even hear the little darts coming in from the left brilliant animation 13 other people left ow uav is bingo rtb for reason one kind of screwed now oh this guy's a good shot could just get a car and go [Music] nine other people you just read a point there corner of this hangar is going to enemy uav overhead maybe i should just stay here just wait i could get lucky with the zone it's quite a small circle really for 10 players alive usually there's only like five at this point dude does he know i'm here yeah ttk and this bullfrog is actually quite quick you know that was uh full health full armor there and what gun do they have how old meta boy again pretty good get close to that and just see what happens i can't stand trucks or something strike away i should move as well while it's going down that fire station maybe okay that's an hour isn't it [Applause] don't really want that fight zone's moving to the middle as well under someone here thinking maybe i should try and take the plane in the middle maybe that that could be the best position i think next zone or hangar oh oh my god i didn't see that guy at all remaining and they've got stopping power oh that is so sad i can't believe there was someone already in the plane i didn't see them when i ran in it was just i don't know like did i turn or something oh gus said that was a great game anyway so we're still going to use this i'm going to post this but uh damn i can't believe it what were you doing in there oh well i would have been in there so can i play guys i'm so sad i'm just editing the video and i watched that back and like when you watch it in slow motion it's so obvious that there's a guy there like right there you can see the red and everything but when i was playing it i just ran in there turned straight away and it just kind of looked like a fire extinguisher on the wall of the plane or something and it had that weird like bloom effect when you go from a light area to a dark area and oh man i was i really thought i was going to win that one but it wasn't to be it wasn't to be you're living your life right like just looking at that freeze frame makes me sad anyways i hope you enjoy the rest of your day guys subscribe for more i'll see you next time [Music] you
