hi everyone and welcome to battlefield 5. i haven't really streamed much battlefield 5 on youtube but i thought you know what give it a shot tonight see how it goes and we're going to be testing and discussing the new end of round matchmaking which they've implemented into this so earlier this week they released an update where when you get to the end of a round of breakthrough the game will look at the players and the squads and either keep you in that server if it thinks it's a balanced game or it will move you and your squad to another server to try and create a balanced game so it's taking into account you your skill your squad skill all that kind of stuff and there's a bit of debate around this at the moment it is just a test at the moment that dice have decided to do and they said that they can turn it on and off and they're looking for feedback on it do people like it do they dislike it whatever it might be so i wanted to test this today and see what it's like because some people are open arms about this going hey this is skill-based matchmaking we don't want this in battlefield and i think it's that to a certain degree but i don't think it's trying to put 64 people of exactly the same skill in a server it's not that type of thing it's there's an element of that it seems but it's not completely that and there are some issues with this like let's say you're playing in a squad you've got four people per squad but you're also playing with some other people who are in a different squad the chances that you could be put into another server yeah that could happen so it'd be cool if there was a way to link squads and say hey i'm playing with this squad i want to stay in the server with them wherever you put me and i do feel like they're testing this for future games as well so i think our feedback and impressions of this are really important but the intent of this is to create more balanced games because if you play any battlefield game in the past we've had stuff like team switch auto balance but in the last couple games there's been some problems with team balancing uneven games and it's not it's not great is it especially if you're in a team that's losing the server continues and you just keep on losing or losing and people leave and let's be honest even if there was team switch in the game not many people would actually be prepared to switch to the losing team some do but the average gamer especially someone who's playing on their own just wouldn't so i think this is done in an effort to create more balanced games and experiences but i'm going to test it see what it's like i know a lot of people have been sharing their opinions on social media and read it some people saying well when i end a game it puts me in an empty server that's not ideal of course and some people they join a specific match let's say i'll go to the server browser and then i want to play a specific map you can click here you can go to game info and you can see what the next map is like i said at the moment this is just for breakthrough and some people would want to play a specific map so they joined the one before but then with this new system it might put them on a completely different map it might put them on the same map again so it comes with some problems it's it's a really difficult problem to solve [Music] and i wouldn't like to be nice right now making their mind up on what to do with this because me personally i don't think battlefield needs or wants a skill based matchmaking system let's say like cod warzone has or cold war has where it tries to put 64 people of exactly the same skill in the same server i just i don't think it's that type of game i don't think it needs to be i like how there's a bit of variety when i join a server you get the really skilled sweaty players there's a couple of them you get the people in the middle who uh you know learning trying their best and then you get the people who are maybe new to the game testing things out and then of course you get the memers who are going around putting c4 on jeeps and driving them into tanks and having a good time it's a nice mix and that's why i like battlefield because it's a place that you can go and chill right you can test things you can have a laugh you don't have to use the meta weapons so for me personally i don't want that kind of full skill based matchmaking system in future battlefield games i don't think it would work well i don't think most of the player base would want that either but if they can find a way to do this where games are more balanced and you're not disrupting squads and teams then yeah that's cool because you know you get those games sometimes where it comes down to maybe one or two tickets and they're intense right those are the games that you remember but at the same time you don't want every game to be like that right so we're going to play this today you have to go to breakthrough it's only a breakthrough right now they said that they might turn it on for other game modes and it's not in custom games either but we're going to try this we're going to click play and see if it works see how it operates so it should put me in a squad hopefully it doesn't take too long so let's put me in a squad now it's going to try and find an appropriate game for us if this is working perfectly it should put us in a brand new round with 64 players so you can have that experience from the start that's what i want to see here i don't really want to wait longer than 46 seconds let's see what happens thank you for coming along to the stream tonight guys hope you're all doing well what's up hotep captain fuzz austin mustafa christian thank you for becoming a new member i appreciate that uh any members now get access to my discord server as well if you're interested in that so that has put us in a game of panzer storm breakthrough i'm not a big fan of breakthrough i much prefer conquest but okay so it's filling up it is the start of a round which is good it's going to restart the round we need more players in here though let's see what's up charlie hey lightning lego am i attacking i am attacking yeah i prefer to attack although this uh map and game mode combination in breakthrough is awful i'm not a big fan it just becomes tanks tank simulator sitting on the edge grinding the infantry in the middle but we'll give it a shot shall we uh i'm pretty default soldier here aren't i should we pick top memer who should we be jonathan mcneil that's the new elite i think he looks pretty badass let's go with old

right let's request an order soldier yeah i've got the liberator as my secondary maybe that's uh a bad idea people love to hide in these buildings it'd be an interesting test as well to see you know what's the skill level of the players like in these matches that i'm put into will it feel any different to my usual play sessions that flame tank dude that is so sick love that what's up ethan hey emman the doctor how you doing guys i think i'm dead oh god there's people everywhere am i being surrounded right now yeah there's the dynamite thank you very much at least i got a revive and i get

enemy in this trench give me an order squad leader let's go and again here without dying oh no never mind we tried what's up hunter nor did you know that bf6 was leaked by a picture i have not seen

played jack is chatting that's right right okay so let's see what it does this is the test of the matchmaker look at that fine looking squad right there love that ddk boys okay right so that game didn't really feel that much different to me that just felt like a normal game of battlefield to me i didn't feel like i was being killed by sweats or anything nice mix as well if you look at the scores finding game so it will keep this squad together it should add one this isn't a pre-made squad this is just randoms [Music] see what happens takes a bit longer they said it adds around 10 to 15 seconds at the end around okay what's it going to put us in twisted steel breakthrough all right okay okay so again so is filling up dave what's up thank you for the five glad to see you back on battlefield enjoy yourself you have to play destiny 2. i've heard they've had a load of new content recently right new a new raid and everything is that right hey mathias how you doing where are you from i'm from england matias we're attacking again aren't we this is quite an open start so i'm going to go with the stg cannot wait for bf6 me too seoul it's gonna be a long wait might be next october november until it's out but uh i think bf5 is in quite a good place right now you know they've had a lot of new players too on pc i think the steam concurrents are like 6 000 at the moment uh but on xbox they've just put battlefield 5 in the xbox game pass so if you're an xbox player and you're good now be a great time to play battlefield 5 on xbox because there'd be a lot of ah noobs still got the liberator i'm defending all night yeah we're defending this position damn it yeah but i've been i've been enjoying bf5 recently it's fun to play every now and again [Music] we're going to get bombed oh no i called it are you a dog or a cat dude i don't have either this i like dogs and cats they've both got their quirks what am i graphic sayings trend we're playing everything on ultra uh yeah everything's ultra [Music] i don't have ray tracing on so this has put us into a full server as well i think it only kept one member of my squad is that right did it keep two you ain't out of the fight yet hey samuel will bf6 be on playstation 4. oh that's a good question 128 players big levels that kind of thing you know i kind of so you know if you think about like developing games for those and next gen i think it's going to hold them back a lot but based on what they've said i'm pretty confident it's going to be next gen only if like and if it is released october november next year then by that point there'll be need a medic recently battlefield 5 battlefront 2 and then you've got all the other stuff like fifa need for speed but in terms of first person shooters i mean you know battlefront 2 and bf5 they're running on older versions of the frostbite engine so if they did a next-gen only frostbite engine game i mean the graphics and the effects you know they might be insane right i do hope that they prioritize gameplay over art design you know i feel like that they made they made some mistakes in that respect with this game in terms of visibility they have fixed it up a lot but there's still some time there's a big easter egg in the game right now where if you go to combined arms and you put morse code in on your menu you can access this secret game mode called the challenge where you build these stairs up into the air i've been doing it with my friends on twitch for the past few days last week or so really it's a huge easter egg i'll res this dude there's a medic that's better what if i could get a plane bit too slow there can we all you've got to do is come a bit lower that's it that's it oh bit too slow again reload i do want to get one of these planes though that'd be sick where the enemies are man they're not really pushing are they oh i see there's a hacker on the other team right that's why people have left yeah there's a hacker on the other side uh how do i could i report this guy scoreboard profile report see this is the problem with cheaters as well in battlefield games it's so many steps to just report someone [Music] where did this happen in game uh obvious cheats on twisted steel breakthrough there you go he's just murdering everyone with an mg42 all right let's quit that that's an actual chat right there yeah if dice actually make it easier to report people as well because you see how many steps that was to report that guy so many steps it should just be like it is in cod where you can just go select player report cheating there you go that put us into a game a bit quicker there yeah there's still cheers it's probably because i'm streaming though death this is this has been an issue for me in the past with battlefield v as well why i don't really stream it that often so that's put me into a game with no players that's not ideal is it gonna fill up just see what happens yeah i feel like the matchmaking's failed there obviously this is a if this is something that they're testing for a future game they'd have more players right so especially if it was cross-platform the matchmaking should technically be quicker but like this has obviously failed on this occasion what's the pistol it's the liberator you just get one shot and then it does this core reload [Music] of course you can always subvert the matchmaking system by just joining a server right and the good players who feel like they're just being put in more difficult servers will just disconnect anyway and use the server browser i just hope that the next game's got a server browser in mac thank you for becoming a member kyle thanks for the one i appreciate that is it's a gorgeous map isn't it abby ethan thanks for the 20 what do i want for the next battlefield game and what's my favorite battlefield map ever oh man what do i want for the next battlefield game i want i want bigger maps i want more players i want a sandbox experience where you can just have fun and have a laugh i don't want it to take itself too seriously in terms of the gameplay i want cross-platform i want a good anti-cheat i want a server browser at launch where you can have persistent servers and you can set up the rules i want decent gun play like i prefer the gun playing bf3 the most but i also like the gun play in this game bf5 um i want gun customization that actually has depth to it they can't you know the kind of thing that they're doing in modern warfare and war zone like that i really like that because there's trade-offs uh crude thank you for becoming a member that's very kind to you servers with this guy maps maybe rush was really good in uh bad company too there was some good rush maps for bf3 hey ali do they have dedicated servers at the moment i think so in sea uh i'm not sure stoke does that put me on the same server yeah it did the matchmaking isn't working [Laughter] the lag is a problem with youtube guys it's not i have a gigabit fiber connection i i have one gig upload one gig download it's it's either your connection or it's youtube just lagging i'm sorry youtube's got a couple problems though with uh 4k streams and i have been in contact with them to try and fix this because it is annoying it's gonna put me back on it again isn't it no we're good twisted still i definitely can't stream bf4 british boy i can do videos on bf4 but i can't stream it because the hacking is so bad yeah if you've got a lot of lag just refresh the page change the quality as well i'll try that randby it's been a problem over the last month yeah it's happening on all youtube streams like i said i have been in touch with them to try and uh fix it and i've shown them all my data to prove that you know it's on their end but it's not gone anywhere yet unfortunately this put me in a game that was mid mid round can i get across there let's try ow that's a good shot yep i get health back from that now i didn't bombed yeah the music is brilliant isn't it crew it's great help me buddy no not no need help here hey joey what's up john am i attacking yes i am get up on the bridge maybe just tell us what you want us to do tell us what you want us to do where these guys are hey tyler thanks for coming to phantom that's been killed by vehicles twice now where is that tank is that on the bridge oh we're defending right okay come on let's go evan thanks for the five [Music] hey patrice what's up hey enzo tom i'm good man i'm good thanks this game with bots i don't think battlefield 5 has bots where the enemies are dude just got obliterated bf6 is going to be vietnam i'll get an angle i've got the kill assist danger over there and probably just went through that's better that's a miss very satisfying those headshots the sound as well i got rest i like how you can hear the guy breathe as well i'll try and get that medic because he keeps just reviving everyone no one's on this bridge no pay attention here [Applause] oh that sounds good isn't it oh it's so good such a good sound this is a car 98 casper look there [Applause] on the aaa dude get ripped [Applause] keep requesting these orders [Applause] oh good shot it's quite a good overlook this isn't it this position see down to that point there what's my longest shot god i don't know like 800 meters i guess maybe the duck down oh nice shot he's waiting for me this spot is chill town yeah that's right dave hey mick what's up [Music] 50 let's go good rez watch over there i kind of want to just get over there might be more fun i don't know if i could shoot off there oh hello there's a dude right next to me hey smiggy good to see battlefield content fired a cod yeah i think warzone is getting a little bit stale you know i'm really looking forward to their new update whenever that comes too slow a random person why are your games so perfect and mine is so chaotic no idea you need to watch your back ah i'm lucky they took the bridge go over here really good guy i've gotta back off from this i think right here how's that not a headshot dice i could only see his head [Applause] can't do much about that i haven't really noticed the difference in the skill to be honest like take it from here you know what's what's their intent i know they're taking feedback on it ah man down get a plane i don't think there are any planes at this point for defense i'm not sure if i could get one hey theo thank you for becoming a member [Music] let's have a look no the defense don't get planes there that guy died okay and was born here outside the bridge and they're all over that point now put the order on it no more flares there's a guy with the mg there or something nice try uh master mike thank you for becoming a member oh no underwater i'm drowning yeah thanks for the five you don't like the new system abhishek what don't you like about it the biggest problem for me [Applause] so i know a lot about being squads and then maybe skill something like that because you want to have a balanced match right like you don't want you don't want it to be an absolute walk over every time spawn beacon see where it puts us the next time no targets here dead that's a shocking dude isn't it hello looks like i'm trapped our voice line is awful i do put no effort into that whatsoever oh there's another rocket i think that's friendly rocket i think we're okay there's someone up on the bridge here though isn't that i've got you mate should be okay now you owe me one seven tickets take control of the objective yeah the controller the objective can i get one more headshot that would be great wouldn't it i don't see anyone to shoot we got the win yeah we did i only lost two sectors there's all what's the better studio are you doing hey sir assault nope i did not say hey siri [Music] okay so now it's gonna match make me into another game again [Music] see where it puts me this time i think it should also take into account the map that you've played in the round before so it's like okay well he's just played on twisted steel he's just played on morita and he's just played on panzer storm so we're not going to put him on this map again solomon islands breakthrough okay i'm down with that by medic go to zk [Music] use as valid warzone lumpy i've done a video on the as well it's okay it just needs more bullets it's not very it's not very good for trios and quads was it brad a legion [Music] damn it jeremy thank you for the fire big fan since bf3 days one of my favorites was alien isolation walkthrough big f on the easter egg on the other day yeah it was good wasn't it any isolation was a great game love playing that game this guy's stuck i'm gonna be killed as soon as i get off this look at this pay attention keep yourself healthy no i don't i don't want to get in the vehicle i want to revive just a moment that was cool nice little beach landing [Music] there run out of ammo [Music] hey john can you give a shout out to my clan misfit generation yeah mr generation how are you doing hope you're playing the objective need more ammo ow that's no good oh that guy's in the game again isn't he yeah he's just following me never mind i really hope that the next battlefield game actually has a decent anti-cheat that works because i want to stream this game and i want to stream the next game but every time i try and stream it this happens and there's nothing i can do about it [Music] no no do i use the spr yeah um all right and we'll we're going to end it there today guys because i don't want to ruin people's uh experience because that guy's just following me around onto servers and it's just ruining the game for everyone else and i don't want to uh contribute to that but yeah guys please if you're watching if you're listening please put a decent anti-cheat in the next game please i want to stream your game i want to do it anyways i mean that was a little test to the matchmaker there [Music] i think it did okay i mean it did put me in a gamer morita that was kind of empty but the other times it seemed to work fine i didn't notice the games were particularly sweaty or more difficult than usual um anyway guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend i appreciate all the new members and donations thank you got a really busy week lots
