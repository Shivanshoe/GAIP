let's see what's happening on the Infinity Ward Twitter a quick playlist up day is now live across all platforms to adjust the following removing uncommon read verse 5 versions of the m4 assault rifle and warzone Luke [Music] Arella I'm so glad that that thing's gone but welcome everyone I hope you're doing well today we're going off meta we're running the ax 50 as our main sniper rifle rather than the HDR shocking I know I just wrote the ax 50 off pretty quick at the start of war zone because the HDR has a faster bullet velocity meaning that you don't have to lead as much or account as much for drop and I also prefer the default scope on it but I gave the ax 50 a chance for this match and it was just dropping people left right and center here's how I had it built if you want to copy my loadout works really nicely this one I'm also running the m13 in this game - built like this just because I'm poor to the ground now even if it means that I lose a few fights but this game is absolutely nuts I'm playing with studying Westie so many eliminations and we found the perfect sniper location I hope you guys like this if you do hit that like button below that's a great way to

a new one yeah that's got to come with dismemberment standard I want to see limbs flying with that thing there isn't a dismemberment growl yeah is there that would sell like crazy Oh God everyone would buy activision stock price would just go through the roof yeah everyone buys it so many people for the purple one as well yeah you always see the prices for that thinking me wrong and they and there's an mp7 with that as well a lot of people forget there's an mp7 with the traces too yeah that must have been such a popular park art dude not even that the recent one that where they put the sniper scope on the ground did you see that one mmm-hmm yeah that one I guess I bet you that was properly I think that's a meme where they just knew everyone used it a long range they just stuck a sniper scope on it they should just sell it would be really really dodgy right they should sell a blue a pack which is just called meta it's just got the meta growl and the meta mp5 info for the free-to-play players I'd be unbelievably smart yeah all the free-to-play players to just buy that the one item that you need from the shop it get really expensive very quick yeah there's a sniper there on blue yeah yeah peeking hit me even though in this hit minute one down [Music] you got that close the strike stop give me is that right I think it was 233 these guys look familiar our down them down there behind the hill we can't get it because yeah oh another load a drop yeah there's an enemy one right in front of us it's gotta be someone else now oh there thank you like where don't see what don't we just get like their ears are blue they'll have been waiting for the load-out drop there's still 19 left in the game I mean you reckon there's someone behind it it's like I'm great Mae Mae I mean we've ruined ourselves by leaving the high ground here we might as well just go back up to Jack yes go back up to Jack you can come back here yeah in compounds we didn't get spotted at all incoming purple tracers I feel like there's gotta be someone on green like over there oh yeah am blue think about blue look at Rouge surely do you want to set a high ground on the rock oh I'll be shot down below I'm a break I'm a brick I write these almost exactly on blue marker I use beyond the tree all the load-out drop I'll do that rock I see it Oh miss no I see his lady yeah I could see that oh that's her body he's running there's someone else at the rock I can see the gun a banditry now that's it oh he downed himself in the gas there we go hey but I say now now look fidelity's zones pushing I mean we've got the plane as cover that's our cover I've got the baby monitor we all know that so P so we'll be anything in the anything in the play no nothing alone if I think is three teams that fear to put that without cell presses so we just stick on the right yeah I think that's right we got a good position here yeah their beam each other be firm behind the wall 3 B 3 what was he fighting we've got the circle already with any luck ok let's walk in the mouth up here you can someone watch the right I'm watching the right yeah I'm looking right I'm watching the hole right there there's one right one in that guy's body I'm just gonna hold that gap okay yeah yeah I'm holding right gap study they're probably running to the left again because I've not seen him pee try again I'm just gonna keep holding right for a second one down comes with a rock here out stop that's it down there we go last guys here yeah it last goes in the air Zola see him now other guy couldn't sell for us I jumped over his RPG that's nice so it's really nice good game sniping it was a lovely match I'll let it drop to some cash oh that's what you get for winning don't leave it start get it get it you
