hi everyone hope you're well and welcome to call of duty warzone realism mode today we're going to be taking a look at this hardcore game mode for the game talking about season six which is arguably the end of war zone as we know it some massive changes coming when the new map releases and they did a cinematic trailer for season six where the map just gets destroyed so i expect there'll be some kind of crazy in-game event coming up soon also i've got a couple of announcements that i wanted to talk about too so gonna be pretty chill video today a bit chatty warzone then i haven't played for about a week now last thing i was doing was iron trials and i hit that pretty hard but they've taken it away now sadly that's gone and i wanted to check out realism mode now they did put this in i want to say about 10 months ago but it only stuck around for about a week and i did try it back and i didn't make any videos on it i just queued into a couple games on my own so it was solo versus trios or quads or whatever it was and i just didn't have a great time with it because it is warzone hardcore mode it's a bit weird but i think there's some interesting qualities here and it plays completely different to normal warzone i don't think most people are going to enjoy it but a couple people on my discord invited me to play with them i accepted and we ended up winning one we played like three or four games in total had some good firefights but as you can see it's very different to normal warzone because you get increased headshot damage so aiming going for the head way more important you've got this limited hud user interface the only way that you can see the mini map is if you've got a uav or an advanced uav or if you actually press the button that brings up the map but the problem with that is it covers the whole center of your screen and you can't see anything so no mini map essentially unless you've got a uav up and that's temporary you have to buy it or get lucky find it in a box you can't even see how many players are left in the game how many teams are left and you get this really intense moment if you make it to the end game where you simply don't know you don't know if you're the last team you don't know if there's still five teams left they're all fully stacked you've just got to use your eyes and your ears and your tactics and try and work it all out for yourself it's no hud mode essentially and very challenging i mean they're really taking this to the extreme because there's no hit markers you don't see when you down someone you don't see when you kill someone the only way to check your kills really is just quickly open the scoreboard so i think if you're going to enjoy this you've got to play it with a group of friends or at least the people that you're playing with are communicating you're on microphones and working together because teamwork is essential of course it's warzone was already pretty campy anyway but when you take all of this information away it just amplifies that effect so you'll end up with teams just sitting in buildings even more so than usual saying that though we definitely had some fun here is it a game mode that i would play again no probably not but it's a nice time waster as we gear up to season six which we're going to take a quick look at now because they released a bit of information about it an image and a cutscene where you see the dance being destroyed pretty big deal and here's the image so we can see mason there he's gonna be the main operator of the season not really that interested in the cold war stuff on the left there apart from at the bottom the haunting so if you guys remember you were playing warzone last halloween season we had an absolutely fantastic zombies game mode one of the best events that warzone's done but it is on that left side there so i hope that this isn't just a cold war thing and they do some kind of crazy halloween event for war zone 2. that'd be great in warzone on the right hand side the stadium is changing downtown a few of the buildings there have been completely destroyed and toppled over we've got world war two bunkers starting to tie in to vanguard and my favorite thing about this the original gulag is coming back for this last season i think it's the best one still i don't think it's been beaten i'm happy to see it again three new primary weapons as well the 410 ironhide looks like a bit of a lever action rifle typically those kind of guns in large scale pvp games like warzone don't do very well unless they've got very high damage high skill high damage so we'll see how that performs the graph that's an assault rifle i'm sure that'll just be pretty run-of-the-mill maybe acting like a pharah kind of thing and then the lapper which looks like a really fast firing smg and as i said in that cut scene you just see the whole thing being destroyed so fingers crossed i'm looking forward to some kind of crazy event where the map is just obliterated because when vanguard's out we reckon it's going to be about a month until the new warsaw map releases so in december pacific warzone map something brand new i'm really looking forward to that so something fresh something new apparently there's going to be big gameplay changes as well fingers crossed that's all exciting and good fun the only issue with season six for me is that it releases on october the 7th and from the sixth to the ninth i'm just going to be playing the battlefield beta but i'll try and squeeze in a couple of live streams for season six while the bait is going on i'm sure i can find the time to do that there's also going to be some far cry 6 next week as well so watch out for that too so i was using the modern warfare org here with the car 98 a bit of a weird choice i know but jgod and true game data the heroes that they are they did uh new videos on this gun the org with the 556 conversion and in the current meta really competitive again and what's funny about this is that this gun with that 556 conversion it was one of the first ever meta weapons for warzone and then it was quickly nerfed and the m4 started to take over just funny how it's come full circle it's pretty good in this game mode good maneuverability good accuracy and the iron sight on it pretty decent i'd love to try a normal dr though just haven't had a chance to give it a shot yet you've really got to use the audio cues to figure out what's going on because you can still hear the player down noise and the kill confirm noise the squad white noise but of course unless you check the scoreboard no confirmation also this gun was in the gulag little double barrel shotgun thing i don't think i've even unlocked that or ever used it i was like what the hell what is this like i've not seen it before but i looked it up it's been in the game for about five or six weeks i guess it just never made a splash so moving on a little bit of an announcement it's coming up to 10 years on youtube for me towards the end of the month on the 27th that'll be 10 years since i posted my first ever video which was a bf3 video and i know that there'll be a lot of new subscribers watching there'll be a lot of old subscribers watching that have been here since the start and because of your support and viewership and comments and engagement and shares and just helping me supporting me watching my content it's enabled me to work with a lot of big brands and companies in the gaming space people like nvidia intel ubisoft activision ea 2k along the years there's been so many and a major part of that is you guys looking out for me helping me watching my content so i'm very grateful for that thank you and i've just begun a new partnership with a company i've never worked with before and that's epic games and this is a long term partnership which for me personally as a content creator that's the most sought after thing that you can get because it offers a lot of security and the way we're doing this it will allow me to make the content that i want to create so the top and bottom of it is that we're going to be doing regular weekly live streams on youtube playing games that are available on the epic game store so for example they've got a lot of ea titles on there bf 2042 is going to be on there a lot of ubisoft titles and i'm sure there's a ton of other exciting games coming up soon too and the biggest part of it i suppose is the creator code so if you guys do buy anything on the epic game store do consider using my creator code which is jackfrags it's similar to the cod creator code where if you were to buy a game on the epic game store and use my code i'll receive a percentage of that purchase it's that simple yeah i'm looking forward to it and i'm sure that we're going to have a ton of codes to give away during the live streams as well and if you do use my creator code screenshot it tweet me a picture and i'll put you in a video or live stream in the future so end game here myself and chicken have managed to push down the hill but we don't know how many we're up against chicken starts shooting at someone we get flanked i take him out so it could be one team left could be two we just don't know unsure right now nothing on the heartbeat sensor and i just thought they'd be in there so i said to check in look if it's four people it's four people if it's 2v1 we probably win so let's push and see have a quick peek and they're in there behind a deployable cover chicken goes in after me gets the kill and that seals the deal right there that's the warzone br realism win good game that was really good fun as i said though don't think i'll play it again but bit of a twist as always guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music]
