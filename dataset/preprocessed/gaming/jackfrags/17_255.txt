so i woke up this morning checked the date and realized it was the first of september and if you're a battlefield fan you know that means don't you the bf 2042 beta is releasing this month we don't know when we don't know where or how well we do know those things but we don't know when they just said september i thought i'd play some bf4 to celebrate that fact and talk about it a little bit unfortunately ea skipped gamescom they didn't show anything so we didn't get any new footage there i think there's a sniper here somewhere they're not at the top they must be down this other level there is give me your sandwich thank you very much sir yeah we didn't get any new footage from gamescom they did the technical test but that was all under nda can i get this pilot oh you know what i thought that i'd uh i thought that i'd done it then just the vehicle here yes really the last thing we saw was the irish stuff where they did the cinematic there's a little snippet of gameplay there i did post it as a short which i mean it got a lot of use that did so i assume that you guys have seen it but a tiny bit of gameplay in there showing off irish's abilities and that had some gameplay leaked of course of the uh tech test third time lucky nailed it i love this pickup it's so good there's a a vehicle down there what are you doing they've got to repair i have eyes on it's weird right back in it yeah i wanted to play caspian border as well because this is how the towers coming down this map is going to be one of the remade ones for 2042 portal and there's a few bits of gameplay that they showed and it looks incredible there's the uh ac 130 up there is that tower gonna fall on that tank i would love to see that i don't know if it ends up in the river does it come on oh i just missed we got a kill anyway ow i'm surprised that time just stayed there didn't move [Music] yeah with the new map as well i mean it looks like they've completely dropped the four theme in bf3 you know this was a very green map i guess and then in bf4 they made it fall like this but it looks like it's a bit of a mix of the two important and it looks gorgeous i mean the graphics on there pretty nuts is that a good grenade right on him literally landed on that guy helicopter oh missed missed the money shot yeah i streamed the campaign as well for this a few weeks back it was really fun i mean i don't think it's a special campaign or anything it's all right that dude just got wasted okay that's weird oh that guy's cheating you can't want to kill someone from that distance with the choi of cool i think they're flying around the map as well look at that on the mini-map you see that what the hell yeah that guy's definitely sharing pretty cool guy yeah the campaign's uh it's fine there's some really cool set pieces but the um i think the gameplay in the ai some of the character development and the writing leaves a lot to be desired but i had fun with it i'd only played it through once before full of bugs though makes me wonder if they're gonna do any more tie-ins with that game in 2042 so you don't technically see hannah die could you come back could she have escaped the boat not that she was like a fan favorite character or anything but maybe we'll see wrecker [Music] pax dead though rest in place we won't see him and someone else please hit this tank i'm begging i've hit it three times now looks like the ac 130 decided to hit it so that works oh man this acr is painful love it yeah i've seen some dates floating around for beta on the internet but most of it looks fake i mean it's so easy to fake that kind of thing or to just say oh yeah this is when it is but we still have no official word from uh daiso ea goodbye time some people i think it's going to be this weekend but honestly i think if it was this weekend they would have announced it already give people a chance to preload or whatever and also you have to look at what other games are doing as well right cod vanguard let's use a bit of common sense here vanguard's got another alpha for champion hill this weekend oh that was a double okay and then next weekend is their playstation beta and then the weekend after that is the uh pc and xbox phaser so would battlefield want to go up against the cod beta i kind of feel like they'd want to have their own space and i don't know if this is common knowledge or not but big game publishers do actually talk to each other about this kind of stuff a jet just killed me there come on now we've got the new launcher i love the sound this thing knows it sounds like someone's playing on a pie buzzer i wonder how they recorded it oh is that the chair there i feel like it could be don't kill me you killed me and then you bring time of existence that's just rude okay we're gonna play the game of is the attack helicopter pilot good interesting start no it's gone downhill that rapidly went downhill the answer was they're not good most of the time they're not occasionally you do get a good one though i've got the worst gun in the ac 130 guys it's pathetic run damage to that vehicle can i get this infantry oh we've been absolutely classified yet i mean it looks cool though right that's cinematic oh there's a tank here maybe i could small them that was bad [Music] you do a lot of damage from above don't you with the rockets in this game bang oh the guy's out goodbye no prepares for you mate could i take this out i've got two rockets oh i dodged it no i should have pre-fired a bit more why didn't that hit i'm sorry oh what are you doing mate had the rpg out there ow oh cool there's the cheater again good for you mate i did ask in the chat if there were any admins on but um i don't think so the rams nearly over anyway so i'll just disconnect i'm gonna try and take out the ac 130 before the round ends it actually flared it what if i use the rocket i did do this once and i did a video on it as well it's difficult because you have to hit the thing first like that yes right one more the round's gonna end though is that a hit oh it missed never mind ggs anyways thank you for watching guys let's play a fun game of when do you think the beta will be let me know your idea down in the comments below alright if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
