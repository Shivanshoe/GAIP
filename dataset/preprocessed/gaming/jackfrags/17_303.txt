battlefield is well known for its elaborate and literally massive easter eggs like the megalodon and we've all heard about the twists and turns of the phantom program but there are so many obscure and often forgotten secrets hidden away that are cool to look at and discover many of them you may have never seen or forgotten about and over the last couple of years i've picked up a ton of new subscribers that probably aren't even aware of these so today we're taking a look at some of the most awesome and strange easter eggs that have appeared in the franchise and we're starting with the yeti this was discovered thanks to a hint from one of the level designers on the df4 map golmud railway and i bet that you've never experienced it in a real game as not many people know how to trigger it or that it even exists is actually quite simple though you just head up to this rock here right at the edge of the map and when you're in exactly this spot you'll see a bright blue shining light on the mountain far away in the distance you can hit this with a sniper rifle if you're a good shot but it's much easier to do with the s raw guided rocket launcher shoot the rocket and when you hit the light you'll hear this spooky a yeti an abominable snowman hidden away up there and he's not happy that you just destroyed his igloo you better watch out when you sleep tonight the next one is on bf4 as well and this one has a great story behind it and it was explained by alexander grandel who is now an executive producer on battlefield 2042. if you load up heinen resort and take the elevator to the roof of the central hotel you'll find a pickup sniper rifle on the top grab it for yourself and then jump onto this industrial unit if you prone in a specific spot and look out to the sunken cargo ship you'll see an extremely bright light shoot that and the whole thing will explode releasing a shock wave and scattering debris across the level the story goes that this easter egg was supposed to be the original levolution event for the map and it would set oil slicks all over the ground on fire turning the level into a fiery blaze but it was cut from the game at the last minute for technical reasons i'm glad to see that at least part of the effect remained though dinosaurs they're cool aren't they jurassic park well it's easily one of my favorite ever movies but dinos have had a strong link with battlefield thanks to some internet memes and in-game dinosaur toys but one of the lesser known easter eggs of bf4 is very well hidden on the rogue transmission map again this was teased by a developer going by the name of andreas armstrong if you fly to the out of bounds area you'll see a goat and a pen it's very reminiscent of that scene in jurassic park isn't it and this was our first hint well as it happens there are two hidden buttons on this map one here in the construction vehicle you gotta climb up it and another here on a pillar of the satellite and there's even a cute dinosaur drawn next to it press them both at the same time with another person helping you and you'll hear a t-rex roar and see the trees in the background shake i love that once a bit and the whole server can hear and see it too which just makes it even better battlefield hardline had some surprisingly great and fun easter eggs too one of the first to be discovered was the drivable couch commonly referred to as the american dream you could find this randomly spawned on the dust bowl map and it had room for four players in total i often wonder what went through the mind of someone who has no knowledge of this suddenly seeing a high-speed couch go flying by full of a squad blasting their guns and creating chaos if you got a roadkill with it it came up in the kill feed as america very patriotic indeed on the grand bazaar remaking hardline there was a wicked gremlins nod too you know that movie that you watched as a kid from the 80s and it scared the ever living hell out of you and gave you nightmares yeah that one well if you went to the alley here and destroyed the pot behind the counter you would find a secret button interact with it and the refrigerator behind you will slide across revealing a secret room inside there's a ton of references to the movie gremlins and you can even hear gizmo stuck inside a box adorable there's more than meets the eye here though if you look around you'll see a shotgun in a case but you can't access it to do that you have to search the level for these tiny gold mammoth skulls when you find six of them they magically transfer to the case and allow you to open it if you do that you'll get access to the gun inside the mammoth gun and you need this for the next easter egg that i'm going to show you where it really starts to get epic on another dlc level called cemetery you'll see an ominous catacomb with the tree in the middle and on five locations around this place are strange symbols now with each dlc the battlefield hardline released it also had a special retro older gun added to the game and each of these had a different symbol on the back making references to a mysterious organization called the syndicate program so if you get five people with the correct gun equipped in the correct location a lightning strike will hit the tree setting it on fire in epic fashion and opening the door and then if you head inside the door and down the stairs you'll find a tomb with a weapon on top pick this up and you unlocked the secret syndicate weapon it's a lewis gun and this could have been our first hint about battlefield 1 being set in the first world war we just didn't know it at the time now that is an easter egg battlefield 3 a game that i'm sure we all have fond memories of and while it didn't have the epic easter eggs of the more recent titles there were some cool nods in here to other games i think this one here is arguably the most eye-opening one a battlefield 2142 drone or hovership on the operation riverside map and that's a 2142 logo on the side it doesn't do much but fly around this area in a set pattern there's no sounds or anything but at the time of release march 2013 this did start many rumors and generated hype and speculation that the next battlefield game might be 2143 of course it turned out to be bf4 but perhaps after battlefield 2042 we may see a return to the far future and there were nods to other games here too on the marquez monolith map if you fly up to the building here and jump out you'll see some red shoes on the edge seems strange at first but these actually belong to faith from mirror's edge another dice franchise i wonder what she was doing up here though and does this mean that the mirror's edge game is set in the battlefield universe perhaps if you load up the epicenter map there's a couple of good ones to find near the u.s spawn head down the street until you find this wall underneath some shot banners use an explosive to blow it up and inside you'll find isaac clark's helmet from dead space how cool is that there's rumors of a dead space remake coming soon so this excites me immensely you can also hear him breathing from time to time if you stick around long enough and by the russian spawn at the back of the alley here another secret blow a hole in the wall and take a look inside you'll find a battlefield 1942 tank and screenshots from that game along with a radio playing the original main theme definitely nostalgic if you ever played that game so there's plenty of smaller easter eggs in bf3 next up we're jumping back to bf4 and i bet that not many people have seen these ones during july 4th halloween and christmas in the cte client of the game the developers decided to have some fun and introduced some rather wacky limited time easter eggs for the 4th of july they had interactive fireworks going off on the dawnbreaker map complete with a custom guitar version of the national anthem and special red white and blue jet trails at halloween on pearl market there was a nighttime version of the map low gravity modes pumpkins scattered around the place and ghosts that would pop up and scare the living daylights out of you and at christmas time the character models changed into classic characters such as the snowman rudolph and santa claus not only that but the c4 transformed into gifts and the snowmobiles were covered in gift wrap also you could throw snowballs at each other a good time all around and finally for today we're back on bf4 this time giants of corellia on the cliffs here you'll find a tiny toy mech from battlefield 2142 if you interact with it it makes a wind-up toy noise it definitely feels like the developers have dropped a ton of hints for battlefield 2143 in easter eggs throughout various different games and with that said that's all for today folks do let me know which one of these was your favorite down in the comments below and which ones of these had you not seen or heard
