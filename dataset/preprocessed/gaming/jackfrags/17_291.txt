the cold war mp5 i used to absolutely hate this thing there was just something off about the recall the accuracy and it felt quite different to use it on a mouse compared to a controller but as we all know recently things massively changed in warzone base gun stats were tweaked barrels were adjusted and ttk's were raised and now guys i can't believe that i'm saying this but the cold war mp5 is my go-to meta smg if i'm playing serious and i want to win this is what i'm running as secondary and in this match that i'm about to show you you'll see why incredibly fast time to kill 50 rounds in the mag insane maneuverability and this is the build that i've gone for it's a blinder of a match this one and we were really up against it at the end too we have to push inside the prison when there are enemies on top looking at us tricky situation to be and i'm sure you'll all have been there before some clutch plays in the final moments as well it's a good one i promise and before we get into that i have to say a big thank you to today's sponsor alienware they sent over one of their new m15 r5 laptops for me to play on and this thing is a little beast it's a brand new thinner and lighter dual fan design for optimal cooling of the core components and the specs of this one are awesome amd ryzen r9 5 900 hx processor that's eight cores and up to 4.6 gigahertz max boost clock so it's ideal for gaming but also content creation like streaming 3d rendering or photoshop work nvidia rtx 3070 laptop gpu great gaming performance and you can see the frames per second in the top left hand corner of the gameplay if you want to check out the performance at 1440p i was running df5 here native res on ultra settings and it was hitting 100 plus fps that gpu will also give you access to features such as dlss which uses ai to give you higher frame rates and excellent image quality and another nvidia feature that i love is reflex which enables lower latency when you're gaming i use this personally in warzone valorent and apex 16gb ddr4 3200 megahertz memory you got a one terabyte pcie m2 ssd in there and the screen is a g-sync 1440p 240 hertz which is what i use on my office gaming pc so this felt very comfortable for me we've also got the radeon software on here too which is useful for tweaking system performance and also for choosing what kind of profile you want your laptop to run if you'd like something more intensive for gaming or a bit more chilled for battery saving now if you'd like to learn more about this laptop there's a link that you can click on down in the description below and once again a big thanks to alienware for sponsoring so here we go then let's get into the gameplay now that cold war mp5 doing some serious work and coming in clutch if you haven't tried it
