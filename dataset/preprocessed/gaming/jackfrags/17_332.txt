i have to be honest with you the last time i played anything warhammer 40k related was dawn of war and the time before that i was 11 years old and developed an unhealthy obsession for my dad's wallet in the form of purchasing the board game and armies of space wolves which were by far my favorites however i think i was far too young to understand the rules and anytime i tried to paint one of the miniatures it would end up like this i was really bad thankfully i turned out all right at video games and today we're checking out a brand new warhammer 40k game called necromunda hired gun it's a fast paced fps single player game with multiple weapons customization and loot and your role is to pick contracts to hunt and eliminate monsters and various targets collecting bounties and rewards along the way as you play through the story a big thanks to focus home interactive for sponsoring this one if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below and it's available now on pc playstation and xbox with that said we're gonna play through one of the early game missions now hunting for a target and attempting to board a giant train if you enjoyed the video leave a like and a comment below thank you it's a great way to help me out let's do this this is massive what the hell oh my god i thought i was gonna kill me every second a giant train it's cavernous okay looks like this is it you need to get on top of it to get on a train right let me get up there what the hell is that i look like they just left the body there as well unit 32 right so we get on that and then we jump on a train we're gonna go rescue this dude but it's so gothic i love it let's go what the hell is screaming forbidden non-authorized gang nice look yeah oh hole highly flammable much like many things in this game i'm sure i wanna know who keeps the candles lit that's a big job man there's a lot of candles there look at that so many candles they're gonna burn out eventually yeah that one works excuse me that's not cool i've got my cyber doge get him cyberdog oh nice there's one underneath me i didn't see good boy keep going up oh i see come down the elevator i hit something explosive then and i don't know what they've got like a cloaking technology or something let me go let's go doge i've got this like shield thing as well this thing watch rotate down that's a plasma gun isn't it i think it's a plasma gun who's that then all these northern voices makes you want to talk in an accent you don't usually hear that kind of accent and dialect in the video game so it's kind of cool but i guess it fits with the 40k universe an aesthetic that loot [Music] goodbye i guess we should go brutal you go over there yeah i'm looking for you mate goodbye it blew up didn't it yeah what's my secondary i've got this bolted thing doesn't do a load of damage but if you get the headshots maybe a one bank you see pretty good [Music] that one opened up you how dare you just above me jump in all right so we're on deck 32 let's go up here we'll run come on bad guys it's up goodbye i'll shoot me in the back get on the train look at my bionic arm there jericho is going to have to up my for this jedi core is gonna have to up my chef you just don't hear voices like that in video games i appreciate it you know all right now we're on the train hey did you make it i did make it mate are you okay he's a bit of a cotton engager any yeah i made it maybe this cerebral implant ain't so bad after all it's so bad after all very gory isn't it proud i don't know what that means is that the name of something on a train or name with somebody excuse me who was i don't think so mate and they're just across there given the bean i'd make that oh then i chickened out at the last second cool that you can jump on those chains though we've got a rat yeah underwrap hello sniffing about is that my rat stew i think it's got a different magazine on it it's not already trying to get the head shot right this one's definitely a further distance isn't it okay okay we got it good night it's a long way down let's get in go down really funny that they go blue isn't it they stand out like a sore thumb i've got my cyber dog yeah he's off cool down get inside the dog oh enemy cyber quick dogs good job cyber dog probably that noise is incredible oh wow it's

killed me then we're in what is this hey you're tucked in here with me i think you do have a little window to get help back as well that's a slightly bigger dude with a minigun or something go dog dogs on cooldown and i nearly died then oh more cyber dogs what is that oh dude i was just looking at the mech thing you could do me like that i do have a med kit as well not sure i needed to use that then but useful to know how to do it [Music] that room's clear there's some big missiles man oh no there's loads of them now i'm gonna have to fight these or do i get to control one keep going keep going hey i got this i'm gonna find that goliath enemies all the way down there what is that okay so that's the shotgun nice i was gonna say like when am i gonna get one beautiful oh doggo hell [Music] nice what the dog how did you are you a magic dog oh you were done for on this platform yeah this is gonna be the right way there's arrows on the wall guys usually that means you're going the right way if you can't figure it out look for arrows on the wall oh man look at this boss fight surely surely there's some kind of boss fight here excuse me what is that dreadnor i think that's a dreadnought dog can you attack that does it even have a weak spot get it dog don't just look at it there's some nades on it i said dog oh my god it's massive i have to keep dashing he just wants to hug me i think okay we got it don't blow up and kill me please good job dog oh they just burnt through my shield is there another one down there yeah oh that one's gone last one absolutely chunky boy he is he's buried he's married into the ground where's he gone has he just been i don't think this one wants to hug me as much as the last one hey okay he's on fire oh no he wasn't with me now definitely won't hurt me now i don't want to hug that's hilarious oh theory deary man you see that one of the cars is all locked there oh what's this that must be inside grapple hook a grappling hook press left shift to use the grappling hook the graphic can also be used to remove enemy's physical shields okay right now it's all again adding more tools to the roster hopefully none of those are gonna hit me gonna stick around to find out though oh my god i feel like that one was gonna hit you know all right we're in all right let's i'm gonna test out this graphing hook on people never said that before i'll get down there yeah green is good unless i just did that end what the it's more of these guys again what was the point coming down here ah i literally just said it didn't i green is good oh hello and there's the shield so get rid of it convince is that enough convincing punching them yeah you've really got to use the grapple there i think i can did i convince you i think i did do i have any i do have a couple more med kits i can put it in a quick action shortcut oh okay so that shares the same one as my shield yeah i think i needed that there actually good job i did that okay the difficulties definitely started to ramp up a bit now oh that's not what i wanted to see there's some big lads ow dude you should be no i don't think so oh they're not that tough oh god ring around rosie get away from me absolute chungus wow put my pulse back on open that rust damn door i said punched him in the face and that was enough enough convincing right that's a save got some loot what do we get and it replaces that i think it's a shotgun with a scope on it sounds like it doesn't it what all right lads oh man his head came off straight away i'll test out my shotgun oh god i mean that's quite effective isn't it goliath prison's in there here oh dead end goodbye run away yeah i think that might open up when i clear the wave played some people just a classic fbs isn't it it's old
