hope you're doing well and enjoying your weekend today we are playing some more Call of Duty warzone and I'm joined by tomographic and study we're gonna be playing trios today and the whole theme the idea behind this particular video war stream if you're watching it live is to test once again is there any type of skill based matchmaking in this game so last week I think it was at the start of last week I did a solo test of this where I made a new account and I just played solos and I wanted to see was there any difference in a level of skill of the players that I was going up against and could I relax did I have to try hard the whole time to be honest with you it was inconclusive and I honestly don't know for sure but today I wanted to test this in squads in trios I've actually added trios back in quite quickly actually they added quads and then they just put trios back in like the day after whatever reason I don't know but trios a good fun squads is also like fun the four player squads but it can get a bit manic at times but today we played trios and all three of us around brand new accounts and it'll just be really interesting to see it's a bit of an experiment I suppose will the people that we're coming up against be just as skilled as we normally find or will we be playing against people who are maybe new to the game I don't know Willie is it just random a lot of people think that there isn't any skill based matchmaking in this game and it's just random no knows for sure but today we're doing a bit of a test so I've got myself tomographic and study and we're gonna be playing for a couple of hours and hopefully we're gonna have maximum fun today it should be good I like these guys they're good players I think we have good teamwork with that said let's get back on discord and see if we are good to go alright lads are we ready yeah yeah yeah alright let's do this so Tama I know is it you've actually done the mission because you get that skin for doing that tutorial mission doing what did you mean start skipped it we're just not very good player so didn't I don't know you could skip it played I ran through it like Sonic the Hedgehog I call that skin the merrier skin I know I know it's a lady but you can get it in green blue yellow Wow we're just sealing the Mario Brothers Mario oh oh I see did you ever see the original Super Mario Brothers move over isn't that the one that has all the memes yeah and they're live actually ordered me I'm see a live action one there oh dude who Dennis Hopper you know that is my way yeah he sir but he's Bowser I think a lot of what I'm gonna look up pictures jackets and Bob Bob Hoskins is Mario right I guess uh-huh yeah sure I don't know no I've never know I saw this movie like 15 years ago I I can remember Yoshi looked like a velociraptor Yoshi did not look like yo ha Wow I'm sure that movie is not withstood the test of time and he's probably willful yeah but if it generated memes then reload crossbow that's all that matters so those movies are made for a thing these days these people are making yeah think about people making movies just for the meme how can we get the most minimal sonic thing was a ploy I think the trailer was just made with that weird-looking sonic just for the meme and it grew a lot of hype around it and then they released a fixed one movin work on this for mums that's interesting do you think it was all on purpose it's all a big lie I've gone inside man also Perry jangles how you doing hot drop it Simon w-was it Brian Olaf how's it going guys thank you for coming

clear enemy I mean that was full crash dang that's a toddler I reckon maybe spied movement yeah I'm broke down we are being yourself isn't that we're being hunted we are being hunted three BTB one for this one well you never know we might get we might get off for good one of them's just been killed on this marker from West's so they could be this building name well don't know I'm get the heart be out again I'm gonna I'm embracing the new play style I'm prone oh hell it's three BT dubs missed a show of my life was that you something yeah on green pain in the building found okay so it's 3b water back stop he's laid back arming Melvin okay it was a lot of running in the open or just a whirlwind so what's different what what are our first first impressions and a brand new account ran in the building you know when we were flying the people in the building the first time yeah ran in the back smashed open the door he looked the other day for at least maybe a second and a half interim okay maybe he doesn't have headphones so right let's assume let's assume that this has happened because we are literally brand new all three of us have never played a game of war zone before so now it's got some sterasyl oh yeah it's got some stats so the next game technically hopefully it's looked at those stats and it will be quite different it should be different it's realizing we've won our first match on new accounts so it probably thinks look at these smurfing idiots I'm gonna throw them in the high skill bracket I hope they die immediately apex predator wait who's hosting this yeah okay also that one of the guy in one of the guys new chat said star star star in star star star star YouTube safe there stud I appreciate that he obviously thought we were stars yeah I'm being assaulted with battle positive information right now are you guys being assaulted by bar pass information no I'm alright okay what do you mean well that's the only way I could describe it on the game is promoting you to buy the bar pass yes heavily Wow reward anyways next game instant reward well we could make us load out so we can make up some low notes alright yeah do we want it I mean we haven't got your honour DJ I want to have fun with a weapon right yeah but we're not no no we're gonna get SB mm now stud we can't have any more fun that was the only fun we're allowed that was the one'd Munroe if we want more fun we got to make a new account again I'm not prepared to do that this is I've got I've got the power I mean I'm trying out the foul and we go you know it's like it's alright oh hell is they I don't have I even got that unlocked yeah I do none of us went to the gulag as well you're right Dakota yeah yeah we don't talk about that place I actually think the loadouts that it gives you at the moment will be better than what we could make that's I'm not gonna have fun by fun do you mean make it harder for yourself that's right right we don't let's go I'm starting to understand what what fun means in stars world day by day match by match it's funny learn a bit more it's that it's just fun right here we go where are we dropping boys I think we go maybe till two towers okay we go tilted or we could go shifty shores or wailing woods Pleasant Park maybe Pleasant Park oh this time yeah absolute soldered on it got some great insights lesson what's that magical downing arm is gone are you doing hey Trevor racism I even set my custom loners yeah yeah you can if you forget a low that box what was a there's an interesting first game yeah I mean I think I sweated maybe one single just a single drip yes hmm think it was slouched in my chair Aloha Oh a BG it's just maybe krakozhia makin a cup of tea ooh I know I just hadn't had a Nvidia what's that thing called Nvidia T yeah that's what I saw it's trying to say they've got a mug that has a screen built into it and you can play PC games while drink anything well yeah no how's that work it's just that's just innovative Nvidia anger I don't know what you just said in an innovative is what they've called it oh I say right okay yeah yeah instead of innovative it's ya boy initiative see now it's taking longer to find a match because it's got anger on the second and gone yeah these guys are way too good for their first game what's happened dear it's it's caught this one up as an anomaly isn't it yeah it's sending it to the programmers an hour weep weep whoops math detected Smurf to a match time firestorm I think we're all gonna have fun all right let's have some fun this beat is secretive shield that's what I was trying to think of Judy shield did you yeah I had one of those when it came out it's cool my serve and then I put it in the drawer well it's NVIDIA shield keep away apparently the last guys before against were level 80 that doesn't make any sense though Linda because that you can still have the games but like level 100 but they're not actually be that great oof again yeah one of the guys is no I don't know we killed remember to go I found my stream so it's not about time play it's about skill yes yeah it's gotta be putting you in a bracket let's see if there are more interesting skins here I should have had my name is not holographic and then they wouldn't have known it was me that's it that's how you do it telephone maestro how you saying company sir yeah a bunk

heard the explosion okay so observations of second game observations at second game was increasing last game definitely not bemis sly I didn't I've noticed several times I think people and they didn't be seven-year-olds then maybe we're late for the hot spot we challenged on that time we did and there's if you go to a hot spot in this game RNG is a big factor yeah I mean I lost my first gun fight because I'd a PKM and he had a news it you know that's I'm gonna lose that one yeah close range that's just RNG we're all fighting full teams on our own which wasn't the case last game okay so what we'll scrub that one never happened now we've gone back down a bracket yeah Georgie thank you for the 20 always fun to watch you keep up the entertainment and Eric's thank you for the - we've got a new member as well happy father thank you very much my friend it's very corny Guzzi sucks yeah it's it's not great it's not great well um we're doing an experiment today this is why we're all on new account we want to see if there's any kind of skill based matchmaking based on the first match I think it was quite evident that we were playing against other let's say maybe you know average players let's say whereas on our normal accounts we pretty much every game or up against really skilled players in every fight is very try hard and intense not that that's a bad thing it's just I think sometimes it's nice to relax a bit when you're playing a battle royale game you don't want to try out every single game that's my opinion but no one knows for sure a lot of people think that skill based matchmaking is in this game because some people think it's just random some people have even done experiments on it as a guy called exclusive ace on YouTube who's he made a video on it and he broke down some information based on the games that he played it's an interesting video it's science that's it Terry we're doing a bit of science and the science may be flawed but as long as we're having fun that's all that matters right that's it Riis have I always played on PC well I play mostly on PC yeah I do have consoles I have a ps4 and Xbox I grew up with you know snares ps2 Nintendo 64 game cube it's just I prefer to play on PC Agila and thank you for the sin oh my good intense [Music] what's up Midway Ben what's the best gun for no recall and distance ah I would say probably the m4 or the m13 maybe even the growl okay where to this time also be deadly I mean we're going for relatively hot drops these round that's how you want to play a stud but I mean why not see if you get him to gunfight straight away yeah okay hello bianna quality loss booth and have I played terraria no I haven't I've heard it can be quite fun though any LAN service people landing on top of the roof main

rats oh okay maybe more than no way start to beat the route I must become the rat mm-hmm start with this headshot easy rap game over someone here someone's parent or even I haven't played my right oh they're getting rekt though they have the person to use you know you've got some background hop over do you want to be one Jack give you one come on yes yes one of the hardest wins Jack what's the skill in skill base I wish I could have got you guys back I'm sorry alright I got back in and then got super up I just want to shoot a proximity mind and almost buy another go that was crazy start but I was pretty good game GG's in the chat boys she tasted a lot of it's guilty in there sure sweaty based matchmaking Adam Kay thank you for the five so was that game number three or four that was number three again how do you think that so similar level like people didn't really know how to play the actual game mode like their aim was all right yeah there was a lot of just you know really bad miss plays that's standing out in the open PG mm-hmm running in the open with I you know no reason running out toward the zone taking the buildings outside of the zone yeah do you think from a general skill perspective that felt like lesser still low okay although yeah yeah interesting interesting definitely more competitive gamer yeah there was a bit more pressure than the first game definitely yeah yeah once again another person saying something similar to the last round I think there's a lot more toxic people on this side well you get a lot of this on me you servers as well love the option to play na but even if you launch the game up on my merica you get put into EU matches so do you think in general na gamers are a bit more friendlier than European gamers oh yeah in what respect well not just in this game I play with the the death comes on oh you're a lot of expletives when I kill people hmm proclivities yeah clippety is such a good word isn't it the club buddies what's up 21 dubs how you doing I just don't think any players really care as much the most about fun I killed some people when I playing with the guys on any of the day I just laughing constant teams came back with a Zen EOS how's it going unlocked the 50 round mag did I good enough time to make that loader though I mean I'm just trying to play as many games as possible they're just the rygar from manchester what's up hey Ches oh hello Marcus how you doing so do you think the algorithm if there is one there so-called algorithm as they've already calculated where we should be or does it need more games I think it needs like six or seven that's my guess okay I don't see us go much make him there use ten games and then it gives you a rank I think it's the same for Rainbow six siege as well right yeah it's yeah stuff lieutenancy on roof do you think there's an industry standard for that Kazakh no no yet individual developers just decide what they want to go with yeah think some games have had higher random skin we didn't pick again yeah what's up Ian Dixon how you doing man I'm Raj Reddy sleep restore again same zone that's gonna be our NGO please see the city what's up a woot van bins Bergen what's a great name that is best perks cold-blooded go stamped that's my opinion for war zone hello lady Slayer how you doing what's up Zack Taylor Kalman m13 or kilo that's tricky I think at the moment I would go kilo with the drum mags natural things that the spamm in multiplayer uses five games add up you're not basing that off any evidence though are you not sure it's just about to get

man ten players left with seven teams you don't often hear you don't often hear me sing very often you don't often hear me sing very often I couldn't I couldn't have said that any worse I mean I've done a few songs on the channel but old old videos now old memes diamond de Guzman how's the matchmaking well I think it's definitely got progressively harder burner more shops in zone honestly I'm not taking it as seriously this much like I'm I've just been messing around with a crossbow and a grenade launcher so I definitely feel like we've been putting harder lobbies compare this to like the first four games it's quite a big difference there there but I reckon it's it's figured out roughly you know where it wants to put us it's definitely putting up what's up against tougher opponents yeah Isaac Miller thank you for becoming a member also the coulomb from France how you doing hello a just in from Bosnia hey sue Lee no I didn't say Siri no go away Siri I'm not sure I understand don't take the rejection just the quiet Enzo never in my life I feel like this is sweat down a stub you know sweat town Tennessee it was here he's sitting on top of me I'm not beauty not shooting at you though they're even a bi-zonal yeah it's not hitting I'm dead because he's just gonna shoot down on me you can just wait into Lhasa he's just waiting for me out there it's tee back and let you see shadow this shutter there's more there's more fun that's just that guy with the RPG oh wow obviously didn't know you were there I thought you did I was stomping around like crazy it's RPGs then the sniper Isaac thank you for the 20 killed it man always good to watch yes I've not really level do about much to be honest I need the game there deny I need sir car do you think story's gonna win this one 30 beauty well that's what's always there won't be three no won't be to your carry an air started he brought me in Jack in so many times GG Yeah right boys I'm gonna end it there so that was game number six so final observations how do we feel it's definitely their final game was a little more smokey bit still people like I'm stamping around hello the guy with the other game in so yeah we can confirm there is definitely an element of SP mm to the game it's just it's hard to put your finger on it the few games things have played out the same yeah it's like a mix of players I would say there's a around like game number four there was definitely a sheer ramp in difficulty yeah in terms of the fights we were having and the players we were up against mm-hmm our first game was like a walk in the park Clara yeah I'd say the second and third like the second we died straightaway but we did our engineer but then the third was quite comfortable all the way through and then four five and six we some good fights we've had a couple of gulags uh yeah definitely felt it mm-hmm what's the solution what is the solution no RPGs we need more feral cats yeah we did actually deal with a lot of RPGs today and even the n circles well I mean I almost got up you did right the end as well yeah when I was in the bunker mm-hmm I think for that like I don't think the loadouts you get like it's it's put into perspective for me what it feels like the staff is a fresh warzone player I never played the multiplayer and the loadouts you get given you've got you've got a rank up your weapons if you want to compete I feel I feel like we were doing better just grabbing floor League than we were getting our load outs we're just getting a load outs with the perks ready yeah yeah maybe if we had a full load outs in these lobbies we would have performed better yeah definitely plus were accustomed to them now we have our favorites we're using weapons that we're not typically used to I think the RPG is a good go-to for most new players yeah and keep it till the end games and they find so many Rockets around as well yeah and carry so many of them interesting observations gents indeed I'll see you all in the laboratory tomorrow that's fifty one time 9:00 a.m. sharp do I have to worry about see you there catch you later boys good game bye bye oh man to do right boys and girls thank you so
