so i'm running out of time elizabeth the land is dying people are suffering soon i'll starve all because of a terraforming system that's spiraling out of control and only i can fix it only i have your genetic code it won't be long before we hit the point of no return and then extinction i've been searching for months for what i need a backup of gaia the aiu designed to control the system but every time i think i have a lead that comes to nothing and every night i have the same dream i'm walking under a brilliant night sky through a field of flowers and when i arrive at the center i see you elizabeth waiting for me even though you've been dead for a thousand years you're the closest person i've ever had to a mother and for a moment i feel whole [Music] but it never lasts what i'm always left alone this world is your legacy elizabeth i won't let it slip away the valley below is my only remaining lead my last hope to find the backup i'll do whatever it takes to get it i promise savior of meridian anointed of the nora you know i hate being called that stuff well consider it a punishment for running out on us the very same night we beat hades i grew up an outcast remember i'm not much for parties yeah that one was in your honor just saying so what are we doing must be urgent since you left so fast delving into ancient ruins or maybe it has something to do with the blight both actually but um i shouldn't oh no i've been tracking you a long way it's okay after everything you've done to help the nora and my family i swore an oath to help you no matter what you're stuck with me now like bark on wood [Music] okay but if you're going to come with me you'll need to be able to see what i see a focus never thought i'd get your second sight i'll give you another one later and show you how to back up your data data information on the device we've got a lot to cover um i'll have to explain everything as we go you see like this all the time since i was a little girl come on shall we all right i got a couple of scrapes on the way here we should find some medicinal plants stock up so it's time for your first lesson with the focus sounds good let's get started down these graphics though oh my god wow okay don't look like the ones in the sacred lands the focus helps you see the ones we need i'm gonna collect these plants by the stream should do the trick i am playing this in the quality preset and i think it's native 4k we might switch to performance just to check that out a bit later the lighting is gorgeous oh bitter yeah well at least they make you feel better all right we should keep going might want to grab more of these plants along the way yeah good idea yes i will these next-gen berries i mean they're blueberries aren't they i had some blueberries this morning in my porridge [Music] the red stuff it's called the corruption isn't it i think is that right those ruins that's where we need to go i see a few ways down it's a long way in the distance there the backup well um it's an ai it's um it's hard to explain think of it like a set of instructions oh that was a nice dive oh he joined me as well it's complicated noticed you're uh traveling lightly days yeah i um ran into some trouble all the way here [Music] salvaging machine carcasses as usual looks like they left a carcass behind i don't like the look of those by default your hood is set to dynamic swipe up on the touchpad to reveal the full hood go to the ancient ruins a lot of arrows in that machine better take a closer look check it out someone took down this machine recently who else would come here i don't know we better craft some murals of our own there might be trouble or bad there's some ridgewood by the stream like this all right now to craft some arrows it's gonna get some more we've got the weapon wheel on l1 select and hold x to craft arrows there you go me too arrows ready some more over here there's a ladder but can't reach it from here nothing a well-placed arrow can't knock free just have to target the lock after you i mean it looks like i could have reached that doesn't it is he coming by the guys i don't know the transmission the uh message i found didn't say only that a backup might be here we need to find a way in this foliage looks absolutely nuts what happened after i left meridian well there was a fuss when people realized you were gone but then some of us figured you only would have left it over for something important that's an old taxi you're right about that [Music] i feel like i'm gonna need all this for arrows so i'm just gonna keep collecting it whenever i see the it foxism in there look like it's not just poisoning plants it's killing animals too then people will get sick too and starve we're not gonna let that happen the war looks really good too down this way get to the grass never seen one of those before scan the machine before we make our move it's adorable i don't want to kill it give it a second okay see how parts of it are blowing those are its weak spots got it view in the notebook common recon machine the borrower emits a high pitch sound to alert enemies and stun enemies it can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations ocular component that's especially vulnerable to damage okay so shoot it in the face basically weak versus fire damage that's cool it's a weak spot right i'm ready i'm going to shoot it in the face basically okay concentrate you're gonna stand up face me oh here we go oh you hate that don't you oh that's a lot of damage nice stealth one's coming where's the other one right now hey it's so adorable i don't want to kill it is it gonna notice that the other one's dead i can do a stealth kill as well gone i think if it gets closer [Music] how does the focus know all that it breeds data on the machine like a hunter studying its prey yeah kind of oh they look so cool short pulses from your focus highlight valuable machine components over me leaving what did everyone else do well as soon as the celebration was over my mother led the rest of the nora home sun king put his people to work rebuilding the city and i set out to find you little sticks for arrows here someone shot this machine too give them ultimate someone's been through here and just killed a lot of machines already knock that ladder down see another ladder looks like it's stuck door's stuck door stuck it's an old counter strike name knives i don't know if anyone in the chat will actually get that reference but i said it there it is you said you've had a focus since you were a child right yeah i found my first one when i fell into a ruin got the others from an old cache not long ago it's good to have extras i know they made some tech trades with zero dawn but why would they have a backup of gaia please register with reception for the tour exactly they want us to check in with them he just looks like a normal man for a denied please wait here for personnel to assist you dr sobek okay i guess they weren't on great terms with elizabeth hmm well let's find a way in isn't a lawyer clone of elizabeth please hold for identity something like that denied credentials not recognized i guess it doesn't like me either find anything good i should be able to pry this open there's climbing gear i guess someone dropped in from above i still never left this here might have also shot those machines we found earlier so where are they now find anything good a few supplies this is a grapple hook isn't there what's this in the trailers entire camp wiped out they must have come here to delve for scrap basket that explains the smell and it looks like something big came in from above crashed right through the camp and then through the wall but it ripped the whole roof off take a look at the rubble in that gap what whatever came through here brought this down as it went out if i can dislodge some of the debris we might be able to squeeze through maybe i can find something to help in the camp aloy over here i think i got something it's a dead man it's some kind of asaram prototype i think this hook looks like it can latch onto things and this gear pulls it back it looks broken but maybe we can repair it hook it to the debris and pull it out that could work the focus can help us search the camp and identify anything we can use to fix the tool my focus picked up a couple of things to check out it's purple poor guy acid burned right through his armor rucksack there's some supplies there a lot of supplies here part of the machine could help fix the gears anything else in the back oh it's a training dummy [Music] do that heavy attack oh over there machine cable stronger than rope all right i think i have what i need to repair the tool or maybe even make something better you could use this workbench of course there's a workbench ah these are different tools that you can craft a poll caster an improved version of a delvers prototype tool that can latch onto and pull objects also enables grappling to specific points yeah there it is and there's like three other tools continue the story to discover this item we'll craft that the poll caster it's a grapple hook there uh pull caster now to test it on the debris just came up with the name halecaster is a versatile tool that allows you to manipulate objects in the environment that have a grated pattern so i can just yank this out the way can i tap triangle there we go there's another one there that works better than i thought well it doesn't look like there's an easy way out of here i should scan the area we have to find a way to keep going what's this thing for laser console oh i might be able to get up there use the grapple i don't think i can reach that ladder from here that door looks promising but how do i get up there what's that weird dude good morning i'm osvald and it is my pleasure to introduce you forget what you think you know about us our truth is simple we say reach for the stars even if you have to cross 8.6 light years of space to get there please proceed into the auditorium where we'll unveil our plans what is this place wonder what's in this a auditorium weird yes we'll find out so we can grapple up here x and then x again look at that wow that works that pull caster is useful too bad there's only one don't worry i'll find you another way up wasn't there a ladder there's a ladder over there while moving top l3 to sprint a long jump it's a bit uncharted there isn't it okay i gotta drop the ladder for laurel [Music] i mean if this isn't here he's screwed like he'd never get up thanks humans homo sapiens us we have always pushed the boundary as explorers pioneers trailblazers and now far zenith is taking the next leap into the future that's why we're proud to have resurrected the odyssey when our government's abandoned in orbit far zenith will actualize in less than a decade but that's only the beginning when the ship is complete we will send the odyssey and her crew where no one's gone before [Music] he just got his mind blown [Music] the serious system there will create humanity's first off-world colony the odyssey may take 300 years to reach it but when we look up at the night sky we'll know they're on their way and in the words of our founder the late peter ching boombay the true system of immortality [Music] the playback stopped the old ones could fly through the sky between the stars uh well yes sort of that ship the odyssey it never made it to the other star something went wrong and it blew [Music] is up why elizabeth gave them a backup of gaia for a colony error public presentation file corrupted member recruitment file available do you wish to reactivate yeah reactivate let's see what else they had to say [Music] we all know the projections economic instability new bio contagions rampant ais how long before another catastrophe creates unacceptable risk for the world's elite we here at pharr zenith believe escape the inevitable and so we reach for the stars [Music] now you've seen what we're building here infrastructure to support the odyssey's construction a state-of-the-art data center to facilitate rapid technological advancements and you've seen how we're managing public perception so invest and join us claim your birth on the odyssey preserve your way of life beyond the concerns of earth well they were right about the world ending i just didn't know how yet so everything they said back there about the next step for humanity it was all a lie these people only cared about saving their own skin yeah well didn't work out for them in the end that old's fault guy mentioned a data center there the backup this should be stored in there won't be able to swim across i guess we'll have to find a way around come on it's like a giant launch platform or something isn't it look at it still can't believe the old ones could fly they were capable of a lot of things it's cold and dark and that's it there's a little grapple bit there i nearly missed that on here as well my focus might be able to help here hold that down stay away from the red stuff i got it what is that what is that keep your guard up oh my god a snake kind of look like a giant snake i don't know there's still some ray tracing on it right i think so in the quality mode at least i don't know about performance up here there's more little ferrets careful i don't want those things to call in some friends from underground you take the left one i'll deal with the one on the right you take the left i'll get the one on the right it's called a j moving up i need to sneak up on it to take it out with my spear can't let it see me i should scan it first check his patrol path gotta get closer and stay out of sight i can see where it's walking now i can throw a rock to distract it get it into a position where i can sneak up and strike okay okay just have to wait for the right moment if i throw a rock out there there now i have to take it down the spear strike you go over there little ferret guy that's it that's it turn around oh it's so adorable though i don't i was scanning nothing to say oh did he get the other one yeah i think he did good job mine's down too take all the things yes yes collect them all you have to pick up the rocks as well they're not a infinite commodity everyone's over there [Music] more of those machines ahead something you and i can't handle go down this way [Music] okay how many we got one there one over here target you ready for this oh it's coming over here [Music] right in the face come down there and get behind it it's like cats on that little bit don't they at the bottom of their tail it's a weak spot you scratch it and they just go crazy some of them like it there's another one there got them all i've been meaning to mention i noticed you have a new look these days yeah i know didn't have a lot of time to shave when i was trying to catch up to you going to bed don't worry it's not permanent good sorry my whiskers offend you anointed looks like this little guy got caught up in a flight i couldn't escape i hope it didn't suffer long but scritches yeah that's the one nothing there classroom must have used explosives against the machines they managed to get a couple this way looks like there was a barricade here machines must have broken through i'll keep this for later a small health potion [Music] so i can cycle between those [Music] careful traps ahead oh i might be able to disarm them i mean he dude you're gonna make them explode [Music] there managed to salvage some supplies and not blow yourself up and got more supplies yeah well i mean you nearly blew us up though didn't you absolutely mad lad looks like another cam while we're here maybe we can make some traps of our own might come in handy against machines good idea i can craft some of those traps okay hold down blast trap oh i don't have the right supplies to craft a trap okay i might be able to scrounge up enough materials from them he'll be in there won't it nope i can use this as one okay there's two i should have what i need to craft a trap how many can i make there two explosive trap made cool if anything walks into one of those it won't know where to hit it i guess that i could scan a machine learn their path and then put a trap down in the way of the path over here hey boy i'm glad that there's no stamina in this game like in dying like two scrounger an agile scavenger often seen in packs it can swiftly consume torn off machine parts closing to bite enemies or hull shock attacks from the far weak versus frost damage acid damage so it's the top of the back and the back okay like the tail maybe we could place one of those traps you made its path i think i will you see me okay well if it hits that here we go [Music] come on you know you want to oh they're very inquisitive aren't they they don't give up easily oh you went the wrong way that's it [Music] this guy over here i think the other one's going to walk into that there we go you noticed oh god it's horrible it's a melee combat we're clear cool let's keep going then get some health back very good some more supplies in here been in a lot of old world moments are they all like this they all have their secrets but blueberries every place is different ross thank you for the 20 that's very kind here what do you guys think so far i presume i've got to go up yeah over there i'm going to wipe out the entire blueberry population in this game there won't be any blueberries left [Music] we can climb the yellow things just like in dying light too that machine we saw earlier must be on the roof it doesn't come this way it's just scurrying around above us is it [Music] jeez okay he's got some serious arm strength that's a big storm picking up out there yeah and they're getting stronger and more frequent so the storms the blighted lands the rivers and lakes choked with algae you were born to fix all that yeah but i can only do it if i find that backup i think we're winding our way around to the data center we'll need to cut through that big building on the right out there hey varl there's data here you scan it with your focus this data mentions the tech that farzine has traded with zero dawn it doesn't explain how they got a backup zero dawn trade agreement it's deep rich law keep an eye out for more data please do let's see huh a lot of glyphs i'll tuck this away to study later looks like we've got to climb up this way well it is a thousand years old crumbling nation has begun looks like some kind of meeting room that door on the other side's locked there's another one of those glowing things by the table the brainchild of dr elizabeth sobek empowered by nine subordinate functions gaia the core of the system is capable of advanced planetary engineering an obvious advantage to our space colonization efforts operation phase one establish an asset within project zero dawn status complete phase two the asset will secretly beam cast a complete copy of gaia and her subordinate functions to this facility's data center if all goes well xerodon staff will remain completely unaware of the transmission risks discovery of this operation could result in zero dawn withholding the already negotiated apollo database special care must be taken not to alert traffic state the expert hacker in charge of haiti's protocol in addition extreme caution must be exercised in regards to dr sobek herself as one of the world's preeminent technologists she may have instituted unforeseen security measures a complete assessment is attached this concludes the executive summary i thought elizabeth sent the back up here but she didn't far zenith stole gaia aloy why does that woman look like you um it's okay bro we look alike because we're the exact same genetically identical but she was one of the old ones how can you be her because i wasn't born i was made by a machine it's why i'm motherless why i was cast out as an infant i don't understand what kind of machine can make a person remember when i said the backup metal gear set of instructions it's more than that it's called gaia and for a long time she cared for the world until she had to destroy herself so she made me to bring her back i'm the only one who can and this place is my last hope you once said the goddess spoke to you when you went into all mother mountain was that this gaia yes but she's not the goddess laurel there isn't one how can you be sure it sounds like she anointed you with a sacred task i've had a lot of time to figure this out and you will too with the focus but for now the reports said they were going to store the stolen copy of gaia in the data center so that's where we have to go okay it's on the right way i know he found something look at that hey over here i found something you could use what is it it looks like a toy or something a weapon oh it's a okay thanks for all we should keep moving after you a frost blastling blast things launch bombs that affect large areas the weapon fires frost bombs use them against enemies to build up the brittle state while in the brittle state enemies are more vulnerable to impact damage right so freeze them until the bar fills up and then hitting with the arrows down here a circle just jumps backwards okay i think we're almost back outside good [Music] looks like pandora oh my god it looks like pandora from avatar oh they're making an avatar game aren't i they know what that's going to turn out like you have to go there online another one of those machines switch weapons by holding l1 to bring in the weapon wheel crosstalk looks like we can cross over here i'm climbing up points there you said this back up they've in this game guys look all those places i've been these last few months there were supposed to be more backups about a thousand years ago a guy named ted farrow [Music] huh grappling downwards no he was worse i think i had to go up there didn't i oh just made that careful in the machines careful i don't like this i'm scared that big mouth looks like the ship we saw back in the auditorium imagine going up to the stars it's just a giant shuttle isn't it it's got that heat resistant material on the bond there's a body there we can tag them in the focus to keep track of them they just burrows on there did see another one over there on the left so maybe going right is the better player here [Music] hello there's a ladder in the back i mean i haven't taken out the machines careful oh no go over there i don't have any cover here they're getting closer oh i hate this okay right let's see me now try this hello [Music] i missed it wow [Music] i was nearly dead oh okay i know how to get out of here damn i should craft some more of these shouldn't i i'm gonna have to find that giant snake at some point as well i think so i'm not looking forward to that now unfortunately i got stuck in that corner and there was no machine repair before change about my boat shoot that down very good come on call i know his name's not called i just like to call and call this sounds like call i miss one there didn't i you guys are saying the audio sounds a bit weird let me just have a look try a different mix maybe so tell me something sona was really okay with you not going back to the sacred lands is that any better than warchief she understood why i was obligated to follow you but as my mother she wasn't pleased is she ever pleased i don't think i've seen her smile me get up there somehow this way [Music] [Music] that was a ladder there's some steps right there look at that [Music] huh [Music] three of those things and if they slaughtered all those awesome we'll never get through to the data center there's no way to slip past them they're too tough to fight head-on we could find a settlement convince some hunters to help us that would take weeks and we don't have that kind of time maybe all we need is that shuttle to fall that thing how we'll figure it out just wait here hey loy trust me and there she goes just need to get over to the shuttle to figure out how to make it fall into the basin is this a good plan really we're just gonna try and drop the shuttle on the animal's heads i can make it to that tower i should be able to find a way across the shuttle oh i think one actually may have noticed me there was it you yeah i think it was that one right there health attack head up this way you really saw me then from that far away wow oh maybe it was you [Music] and you didn't notice me then that's crazy come here my pretty [Music] yes very good motion blurs turned off cameron in the sentence gonna be one more surely well maybe not i don't know i'm just being stealthy because i feel like there should be more here there's only three maybe i'm wrong i'll see anymore [Music] might be something over here that i missed there that ladder can get me up to the tower [Music] [Music] i can hear the snake no i don't like that no no no no no so there were three giant machines killing allyson leaving acid everywhere great well that sounds good like the music's picked up i'm gonna have to run and grapple on to that [Music] god look there it is [Music] yikes that was close rickety tower down you don't say on to the next a long way down i won't be able to make that jump oh my god it's gone full uncharted now holding together [Music] please i keep getting like jump scared by that looks like there are massive clamps holding the shuttle in place i don't think there's a control console nearby if i can release the clamps the shuttle should fall right into the basin i don't agree with this plan i just want you guys to know i don't think it's going to work i don't think it's a good idea great more machine's in my way [Music] right now [Music] i'm a little ferret oh we didn't do the stealth attack oh don't you dare borrow that guy's like fine with it in the face isn't he that's the weak spot right there actually knocks them down a bit as well that's cool oh my god it fires at me nope that's one left horrible genuinely scared of this i don't think i've got a block or anything at the moment so it's when they attack you have to dodge roll even if you're in the slow motion mode they still get you i craft i've got max there i'm going to craft some more arrows maybe search these here yeah if you can get the stealth attack in it's really really strong i think because i'm like basic level at the moment i mean i haven't even got like skills or skill trees or anything like that yet like look at this here 31 abilities i think that is 20 for trapper 29 for hunter 29 of iowa 27 for infiltrator 26 for machine master oh my god there's just like so much stuff here to learn control council might be in there [Music] okay time to crush those machines down below this isn't gonna work 100 stupid idea [Music] snack hello the shadows caught up in those cables i'm gonna have to climb the tower to find a way to disconnect them now let me guess is it gonna be this way it's a long way up scanning with my focus could help here i pull that beam down it might drop the excess lift come on down maybe i can just hop up there yeah looks too high that does this attach i love the music it's very good [Music] [Music] [Laughter] okay that creeping doesn't sound good i have to detach those cables quick [Music] this should be the right spot there connectors holding the cables together but narrowing it [Music] [Music] rickety tower with killer machines waiting down below it's fine maybe you're almost right now [Music] god imagine what our next gen only uncharted game would look like like this looks this good already i really hope they make another uncharted game i mean there's rumors that naughty dog are working on some kind of last of us multiplayer [Music] i don't know if that's true though there's also rumors of a remake of the first last of us for ps5 for next year that's going to be nuts as well isn't it [Music] almost there there's the other connector um oh [Music] the boss fight it's gotta be okay i need to take this thing down to get to the data okay where's that weak spot i should target it first i think he just started spitting acid at me there so when i unpause from this menu i don't know how it's gonna go we'll see this guy's called a slither fang weak versus fire damage frost damage and plasma damage so i've got to use the frost things then where was the sack there we go so like the throw area there's like so many weak parts on it oh my god all right so i'm going to use these get the frost damage that thing there that's it i think he just destroyed more of my cover there didn't it i didn't need to do that critical strike well that thing looks awesome i love the graphics on this it's so good okay maybe i shouldn't try and craft when he's doing an attack on it something just fell off it then didn't it i think i got to take this thing down fast this trap maybe you lost ammo might find something i can use around here there's something here what's this let's see what this can do pick it up [Music] oh it's like a plasma gun or something let's see why die oh that's awesome wow it's dead finally oh my god look at this thing it's like a transformer or something what the data center should be straight ahead i guess farl's gonna have to find another way there oh my god those fangs though jesus massive like all the enemies look so awesome the design of them rest in peace neck there's another one there the coil blaster i didn't even get to read what it was called let's make sure it's dead i think i think we're good i think we're good here i don't think i can take that with me yeah we got a lot of loot from it guys rest in peace snack have to pay respects [Music] once i get the backup i can reboot gaia fix the system heal the blight restore listen its dream still there [Music] okay i should find the server security this looks a bit dubious doesn't it i'm close i have to be deep rich lore over here guys ancient chimes did that say toothpaste or toothpick or something dead end please be here [Music] [Music] it's here version 6.9 initializing hello hi hey uh travis state now what's this we got here a pharmaceutical conspiracy to steal a copy of gaia and your subordinate functions naughty you want me to handle this liz blasphemers brew the vipers with a mighty head i smile and pour troubles [Music] what's the deal with this guy i hate him was this guy in the first game i don't remember him so good luck repairing your data and next time you start thinking you can outsmart a tape remember my salute it's like the most annoying character by far so far aloy the goddess there is no goddess i told you that already that's not gaia that's not what i'm looking for it's nothing but a fake [Music] i got it i'm sorry you have a sharp bite sometimes you know but it was pretty amazing to see you fly off that tower and blow up the entire basin the thing is um there's going to be more of that i'm out of leads for all but i i have to keep searching and fast and whatever risks i have to take i will and it doesn't make sense to have someone with me someone who might get hurt this is on me farl nobody else hold on before in meridian you said there was a man who helped you silence you said you used to talk to him a lot about things you discovered from the old world things no one else understands and he gave you the lance you used to defeat hades he's gone farley i haven't heard from him since the battle against hades sure but spymaster murad back in meridian he's good at finding people isn't he come on it might work plus you'll get to see some friendly faces again okay i i guess it's worth a shot we've got a long walk ahead actually i've got a better idea [Music] the point of the lance [Music] isn't this where the first game ended she's come back bless us the savior of meridian has returned you earned this welcome you saved them in not name of the sun king of god a royal welcome for the champion make way murad alloy has an urgent matter to discuss darshan that makes two of us i've sent forth hunters for weeks the sun fall all the way to the sacred land searching for you something happened at the spire come i'll show you watch your step you saved us all to be sure but uh we're still cleaning up the mess it happened right after the solstice we were able to explain it away thank the sun otherwise it might have caused a panic [Music] one night for less than half a minute glowed in angry red from meridian that looked like a trick of the light but those who were closer atop the allight said it could not have been a reflection much to my dismay they said the light rose up from the tower's base from that we left everything just as it was do you think happened i don't know the spire supposed to send out signals messages the terraforming system but hades tried to use it to wake up ancient war machines wait here while i check it out let us know what you find the point of the lance is that a statue of a like that is that a statue of me that's new i guess i should be flattered by the statue it feels wrong especially when my job's only half done anyone in chat got a statue with them all right let's go check this thing out i've got a bad feeling about this star wars transmission thanos couldn't something was transmitted from the top of this fire i guess i have to find a way up there can i go up there i mean are we gonna go up there please hey i found the things i await your findings champion what oh you want me to climb over there now maybe i can jump to that ledge behind could me not do that with x why does that have to be a different button it was very nice of the person who's been around here to leave all these yellow things so i know that i could climb them i should be able to jump back and reach those ropes behind me cool there must be a reason for that that it's on a different button i don't know i could pull that there we go get over here now how to cross over to this fire be able to get up there now and grapple on that my god this actually looks like a transformer looks like he tricked me transmitted something through the spire please save hades why would he do that well if i can figure out where he sent it i can track him down hopefully the transmission note at the top will tell me looks like this panel is a jar an elevator let's see [Music] access lift activated i'll make it easier [Music] the whole thing is opening up i wonder what the charger will make of this [Music] so there's the note [Music] sort of the farthest i see you finally figured it out to be honest i'm surprised it took you so long to discover my rules you wrecked the lance to steal hades how could you be so reckless reckless you're the one who tried to purge hades before its precious knowledge could be extracted the mysterious signal that walked for example avoid obtaining one of those backups you've been having such a hard time funding if you knew why didn't you just tell me i've been having problems of my own these past six months the difference is i've made progress so once you're angered my entirely necessary deception has faded now why don't you come out here and find me in the forbidden west and learn all that i've discovered oh i'll confront you all yes well the recordings make it simple enough even for you [Music] [Music] it's another choice [Music] know what i found you went inside it and it transformed almost like the day of the transformer i'm grateful that it's a stormy day if you will have seen the tower change from meridian what did you discover hades the danger didn't end here it went into the forbidden west and i have to follow i see that can be difficult the west is called forbidden for a reason tribe of ferocious warriors controls much of it that's an act and they allow no trespassers past its border that said under the sun king of art a fragile piece has been negotiated and indeed the next embassy will take place in a day or two on the edge of the frontier where you two attend the gathering under his auspices the tanakh might grant rite of passage instead of hunting you and attacking on sight great just what i need more killers the sun came eloy it's good to see you you left in such haste we never had a chance to properly thank you what is that now please eat them in quiet it's true we bear gifts decorum usually calls for a ceremony of offering at the palace but i thought you would prefer a less formal occasion bring them please avad this is all very kind but i love it vanessa quick better hand them over before she runs off again really must you try it on it's beautiful on behalf of all the citizens of the sundance may these tokens remind you of our eternal gratitude ready for coachella all of that michelle spend more time with your friends come speak to me when you're ready to depart so i guess i could just explode this from right to my new spear should be a workbench around here i can use modify the spear you can turn headgear on and off can you i mean i think that's good i like that it's quite fetching look at this nice piece of headgear right there i like that a lot savior welcome back to the allights thank you savior the orb remains untouched as per blameless murad's instructions there the workbench she needs a lightsaber maybe spear upgrade installs the master override and a new module to enable the build up and release of kinetic energy in combat i'll take it okay drinks later plus something new to store up and release energy uh resonator should help in a fight a resonator tap r1 to perform a light melee attack heavy melee attacks are slower but can knock down small machines to charge up a power attack broken hello there we were almost overrun by the machines hades controlled but we pushed through gentlemen is that the time or do you want to chat some more with your friends time to go i better get going and if i'm headed west it sounds like i'll need right of passage from the tanakh as you said where exactly is this embassy going to be held past the dawns the canyon that marks the western border of the sundom you'll find the fortress of barren light at its farthest edge the embassy will take place just beyond its gates it's a long march a fortnight on foot a couple of days hard riding should get us there actually it might be better to rest here tonight i had gear though head out in the morning of course i'll arrange it gotta get a top hat or maybe a flat cap or something hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] i have to block it out my voice has grown so somber these words don't seem like mine but the iron won't subside no matter no matter what i tried [Music] my raindrops in the flood in this emptiness in the storm [Music] if i fall the wave inside my soul carries all i know who can take my hand in [Music] through darkness unknown [Music] this white [Music] to find the path we lost [Music] is [Music] [Music] carries is [Music] sparks to steal [Music] never seen anyone use one of those to get around is that how i get to baron light uh yes i mean usually but not today not yet and why is that the daunt the whole valley it's infested with machines i can handle machines oh i'm sure you can but i'm under strict orders not to operate until the whistle down at chain scrape sounds the all clear [Music] look i didn't come all this way just to stand around and wait i'll crank that car down myself if i have to well but then who would crank it back up [Music] fine fine though should anyone ask it might be best to say you forced me i see smoke but not a lot of activity smoke's probably coming from something the machines wrecked as for the quiet well there's a work stoppage in effect because of all the fuss what sort of machines are causing the trouble nasty ones and lots of them bristlebacks they're called strangeness is they're not native to the dot just showed up all of a sudden no hunters to kill them well we've got hunters just none that want to cross alvin boss of chain scrape he is self-appointed work stoppage was his idea yeah well i'm just passing through got an embassy to attend you should have said that ain't gonna happen no time soon what are you talking about hear that that's your answer who is that karja's son priest ranked him down yesterday about an hour before the machine trouble started he's a very important man says that embassy at baron light he's the one supposed to run it great a man must get very tired doing that all the time if you don't do as i say immediately the sun king himself shall hear of your insolence thanks to you i was forced to spend the night shivering in the tent exposed to attack i might have died oh me you refused to transport but not this this what this nora girl this savage besides scallywag juarez that's a-loi studious wadis aloy you know savior of meridian really well that lesson's the insult i suppose i came here for the embassy of baronite way i hear it so did you well not with the valley infested and so did aramon proclaim the sun priests most precious and worthy of safekeeping see scripture i shall head to bear in light when the captain of the vanguard tells me the way is clear and not a moment sooner fine captain's a friend of mine you know can i murder him where is aaron wouldn't mind speaking to someone a little more action a little less scroll what is studious studious what he sent aaron and another vanguard out of daybreak to clear the way and so hey down the valley then yeah said they checked the ruins on the left bank for tracks take it from there okay i here there's a work stoppage any way to upgrade my gear i'll bet the smith chain scrape would let you use his workbench as for the bristlebacks you might want to craft some acid arrows hitting their canisters with those will take them down quick thanks i'll find aaron and i'll bring him back hey [Music] where do you think you're going what to the top of the ridge to wait in safety sorry operators under strict orders no passengers till the whistle blows right that's right best start cranking why dwarf would you kindly escort studious to chain scrape and wait for me there you got it i will find errand and i will help clear a path but after that no more excuses baron light embassy if such be the will of the sun the will of the sun trust me the will of the sun i did get some skill points didn't i hunter increased ranged combat effectiveness and stamina trapper increased effectiveness of food and traps warrior unlock yeah new melee combos i kind of feel like i want to be there you know first strike okay energize your target cool block breaker immediately break an enemy's weapon guard and leave them vulnerable to a follow-up attack we're getting some combos now i'll find aaron but it might be good to hit chain scrape first and upgrade my bow kill guys you can't kill him i really really wanted to i mean this place is massive look i just realized look at the size of it these are save points here [Music] manual safe [Music] you can fast travel there as well these burrows here did that man teach me how to craft acid arrows i don't think he did did he [Music] there's a ball there so show us the mop okay it keeps going there you go oh my god there you go there's the map what's next said i could get my bow upgraded in there i'd be able to tinker with my other gear too it's a settlement of some kind you guys want to see the performance mode favor performance there you go you probably see an immediate difference there there's a big drop in resolution and i think the lighting is quite different as well it looks like the ray tracing is gone but that's definitely 60 fps it doesn't feel like there's as much input lag either of course maybe even like 1080p that you know outlander approaching that the savior wanna come in savior i'd love to welcome to chainscrape xavier open up guys jaw of servers [Music] extra detail is definitely worse buy the forge petra hey lloyd what are you doing here uh what time there was still looks good though in this dump it's nice to see you too and not a moment too soon come on [Music] damn brewery is the only thing i can count on in this place yeah i heard machines work stoppage oh those are just the latest malfunctions chainscrape's always been a few tools short of a kit and right there is the biggest tool of all land not our problems the bristlebacks are everybody's ruling you've heard of him yeah but he's a story best told over a cold beer petra petra i'm just passing through i'm headed west oh there's an embassy at baron light i need to make happen and then i keep moving ah of course bigger gears to grind well flame hair good to see you flame hair it's our name gotta move on petra but if you want a cold beer and a few laughs with an old friend come find me at the brewery your choice romance option maybe now this old one guys sounds like trouble maybe petra could use some support but first things first i need to find that workbench and upgrade my bow another campfire here that's different as well [Music] i tried again i'm really really trying i need to watch the digital foundry video apparently they've done a really good breakdown of this like i think this probably looks quite different in quality mode just get a mental picture of that in your head i'll switch it and see i mean it's a lot more atmospheric i would say it does look like native 4k though doesn't it in quality mode hey milda milduff i took some of your stew last time i went into the wild kept me going for a week felt like i could have put a strider in a sleeper hole enjoy it while it lasts sounds like you're serving up some impressive provisions here not again you can have the discount too but you'll have to come back later i think you have me confused with someone else oven didn't send you no oh my apologies it's just that his minions won't stop pestering me his face looks so good what the hell now i've even worn out my special grill since i'm in the midst of a crisis perhaps you could skip to what it is you wanted some of your food of course your last customer mentioned your cooking really kept him going out in the wild where i'm headed i could use some of that i would be happy to oblige especially since you have the decency to ask pleasantly but but my special group griddle is no more without it i can't cook any of my signature dishes i hate to think what will happen when i'm forced to refuse alvin or his goons even if i already had the right ingredients there's nothing i can do unless you can source me a temporary replacement what do you need for the ingredients a few pieces of decent wild meat and i'd say a big handful of bitter leaf stems that'll do as for the griddle a corrugated metal panel might suffice until i can have a new one forged you'd likely find one in a scrounger pile if you follow the river to the northeast don't worry i'll clean it first you'll have no issue finding boars and bitter leaf on your way assuming you're as much a hunter-gatherer as your clothing suggests thanks milduff i'll keep an eye out so that's what gratitude sounds crazy eyes and don't let anyone push you around okay if you say so hello piggies i wasn't expecting to be able to get out that this is where i can make the acid arrows then weapon upgrades trap hunter bow there we go there's the acid arrows upgrade it again don't have enough for the third one what about this bad boy here it's the frost thing i'm just going to check the outfits here increases resistance [Music] luckily i've foraged everything so i can just like get a lot of this stuff you can just do that from the menu anyway right special gear that's just the other tools [Applause] an ammo that deals acid damage is now available use your focus to scan enemies and see if they're weak to acid hitting enemies with acid will build up to the corroding state once in this state an enemy's armor takes damage over time and has reduced damage resistance shoot acid canisters with acid arrows to detonate them so how do i change my arrow type now i just need to find aaron and help him clear the bristlebacks i suppose they're just on by default are they oh i see so it's two separate things in the menu there you can't jump up there am i gonna have to leave the way that i came in that would be so annoying yes we did it what is that okay so i'm gonna play on performance mode for a bit like just to see what the combat's like on performance it definitely feels a lot snappier still looks great what is that it's always something hold tight i'll see what i can do not to worry about running out i kind of just want to test the arrow i'm gonna go away overloaded oh look at the goo that looks so good ow oh right in the face now this guy was in the first game wasn't it he's dude with the mohawk i think thank the forge you showed up tripwire's handy but machine hunting is the youngest game come on over let me give thanks proper like oh no no that's not the guy with the see you're a practice hunter oh hulk took you less time to kill those scroungers and vanguards to kill one bristle that's the guy with the mohawk so the vanguards came through here yeah just a bit ago down that bristle back headed south then those scroungers showed up to carve the carcass as they do then another bristleback ran through i'm telling you it's crazy around here so the vanguard went south probably this whole valley is swarming with them the vanguard seemed dead set on getting rid of them i see hold on they're red you're gonna go chase and cross the dot you're gonna want a trip caster oh baby just any trip caster one of my make free of charge workmanship looks solid enough yep been tweaking the design since i left chain scrape more room to tinker out here and less chance of well accident i should get going thanks for the trip caster all your blasting bristlebacks i think i'll head down to the hunting grounds did you know they have a trip caster trial come by later if you want to try it out maybe after i get things under control so aaron headed south should be able to pick up his tracks with my focus i thought that was gonna be in there be that easy would it and it means that what did that say i missed that enemies that triggered the tripwire will receive shock damage when the builder bargain is full enemies will become shocked for a limited time enemies cannot move while in the shock state in a vulnerable to critical strike melee attack so you hit him with it wait till it builds up move in for the kill [Music] do you guys prefer watching in 60 fps or 4k thursday what's a better viewing experience i just disarm that [Music] trucks baby aaron's and the vanguards you run this way these prison bags are everywhere most people saying 60 so i'll keep playing 60 for now [Music] what piggy it's a quick spanking you know [Music] [Music] sounds like someone's putting up a fight there he is another one down now this this is what i was forced for knowledge to fill just a hammer just the fight [Music] aloy aaron he's happy to say stay where you are i'll handle the rest experience bristleback a herd machine that uses its tusks to dig up resources if provoked can unearth scrap and augment it with acid for use in ranged and melee attacks weak versus shock damage strong versus acid damage we've got a weak point on the back and the tusks i guess is that the throat so there's no point using my acid arrows then is there so i could set up some traps maybe those bristlebacks have acid canisters on their backs it should trigger a chain reaction if i hit them with acid or i could do that i need to use these though don't i oh no look at me it didn't actually did no way come on there we go a craftsman yeah look at the goo it's so gooey oh my god i'll try this heavier time got him cool yeah those are horrible paintball mode a coil is now available in your inventory unlock core slots on your weapons by upgrading them equip calls on your loop to purchase to improve equip calls you loot or purchase to improve your weapons performance yeah the combat feels a lot easier in 60 fps mode this big lad yeah i do need i should have killed that ball before because i've got a quest don't i from that chef that i spoke to i need to get bore me [Music] i've got a stash now as well i can get it from my stash later caught me in my best as usual well you did the hard part i just took care of the stragglers how bad is it this ah who needs ribs i'm good i'm good okay well i know you didn't come all the way to the daunt just to watch me get wrecked so what's the story i need the embassy to happen so i can head west aaron what i did at the spire what we did it didn't end the threat it just slowed it down there's still more to do really well that's great i mean not the threat's not over part that's not so great but hey whatever you're up against your spear my hammer just like old times aaron i need the embassy now i can't wait for you to heal a couple of days rest it's that actually [Music] even if you weren't hurt what i have to do it's it's better if i do it alone [Music] alone now that figures erin i hate to interrupt the romance but i'm pretty banged up here don't blow your blaze i'm coming he's got that captain price mustache this just keeps getting better listen i'll go to baron light get patched up if you want this embassy to happen we're going to need this sun priest studious wadis oh i know him yeah i'll try some [__] the valley of bristlebacks then send wadis to baron light i'll catch up with you there well i guess that's sort of like a goodbye what's up with these eyes they're crazy you sorry that'd be a first where is this coming from i just you know forget it yeah oh there's nothing it sounds like something all right fine now after the battle of the spire you took off you left without so much as a handshake i mean people like me we fought and bled at your side elon you just or you just disappear what kind of person does that oh flash offer moments of emotional choice how aylor expresses her personality is up to you challenge okay or compassion challenge brain compassion hmm aaron look i'm sorry it wasn't easy for you when i left and i know it's not easy now but what i've been doing i've had life on earth is in danger and only i can save it life on earth yeah everything dies unless i succeed well then let me help oh you can't there's no machine to fight no bad guy to kill what i've got to do i i can't even explain it not even to people i care about so much for being useful okay errand by the forge i guess that's my cue maybe i should go with you to baron light no no hey you're needed elsewhere obviously we'll make you without you the haptics on the controller feel like they feel fine i've not noticed them that much to be honest the ps5 controller has got very specific haptic feedback features on it but it might be that i've not unlocked the tools and weapons that really take advantage of it yet for the stash want the explosion let me go take this out why not the animations on those are great [Music] [Music] oh my god i think i should go for the tank on the back there shouldn't i i feel like that might do more damage i don't think you can buy loadouts in this game promo go see what this explosion was then [Applause] i need another two on here what the okay i think it's because it ran through the acid cloud that water actually looks like it's poisoned as well a weird reflection maybe [Music] there's the quarry [Music] need more one less machine another one down oh my god there was two there didn't even see them [Music] the streams in 4k john you should be able to watch in 4k i can trigger the traps as well can i it's cool we finally got some help [Music] [Music] [Music] another one down they're just like big pumpers aren't they really [Music] how would i get it like underneath that thought [Music] left machine this guy's got some frost glass another one down [Music] one less machine [Music] like it's it's insane the acid tank explodes and they just get covered in this horrible goo it look great on the snake as well it's acid i keep calling it goo i mean it's not the technical term you know like it's [Music] to me it's good [Music] i wonder if i could set a couple of traps then maybe [Music] you take a bit longer to craft i don't know what a nora's doing out here but consider yourself oh we tried to hold off and wait for the vanguard but one of them bristlebacks charged us next thing you know was a full-fledged fracas is everyone okay we lost some good people but we would have lost the whole quarry without you at least it's quiet now your ears ought to be ringing with a quarry at work but chain scrapes whistle ain't blowing so we're stuck picking up the pieces i need to get going stay safe thanks to you that might actually be possible today power rangers zoos i think yeah that most of the bristlebacks valleys should be safe enough to travel that's a good way of describing what is the good news then maybe this embassy can finally happen the campfire i assume at certain points you get mounts as well that you can ride around on fly around on look at this [Music] a charger level 13 things of natural resources look at those horns oh my goodness [Music] no i don't want to mess with that some points into survivor here [Music] i feel like i could do with a bit more health infiltrator reduces visibility silent strike deals more damage so it's going to get to a point in the game where i can't stealth kill in one hit oh you can ride a machine you recently scanned what how can i ride it this might go very badly but here we go i don't know how to ride it so maybe if i just stealth behind it you're not gonna go away are you wow that's it i can ride it i think okay i can actually call them out now too i can do the swirly attack nice this reminds me of dino riders that's it this is my territory you stay away look at this oh okay [Music] who did a big charge on me 2v1 let's see i'm the alpha male [Music] i think i can find arrows from the back of this as well [Music] it's kind of busted he's not going very fast [Music] there we go excuse me i can't i can't get in there with a mount that's a shame okay goodbye charger you the best [Music] i can repair it as well look dice you can't get on the roof slow down what here he is ah the way to bear a light is clear guys you're not aaron vanguardsman i will move only when the captain said cleared out all the bristlebacks which i have captain's orders so they're okay banged up bit breathing and waiting up ahead for you well i shall not be moving anywhere until the whistle has sounded if it is not safe for them then it is not safe for me fine i'll make sure the whistle gets blown and then i'll be back hear that we're not leaving yet unpack the cart no i'll be right back don't get comfortable as if that were possible here you could be comfortable petra mentioned alvin is supposed to be in charge around here i guess i should talk to him to get the whistle blown what do you want alvin some kind of payment bitcoin you think i can be bought if you want that whistle blown all you have to do is have your soldiers remove the bristlebacks and sign the concession decree face it what other choice do you have hi savior what auspicious timing might we discuss a matter of importance to the sundom we might later very well i shall be waiting [Music] so the savior herself walloper of durval gutter of use maybe i've heard many tales of your beauty and heroics my fierce lady warrior orphaned freeholder at your service so what could have dragged you away from the fine silks and wine of meridian to this smudge of a settlement your saviorly attention must be needed elsewhere i'm here for the embassy and the embassy why by the forge ah greater gears for greater matters guess that means you'll be moving on once i've dealt with any problems around here that need my saviorly attention ah the bristlebacks of course got to get rid of them if you want that embassy to take place well let's get to it hey and off you go not so fast i cleared out all the bristlebacks done oh you did now that you've recovered from your shock time to blow the whistle over there not so fast i'll have to send someone out to confirm the kills make sure the valley is safe again shouldn't take more than a day or two no you blow the whistle now these are innocent asrim lives we're talking about here surely the delay either you do it now or i will ah i knew you could do it friends gather round the savior of meridian has done it again the bristlebacks are defeated you what sound the whistle chain scrape is open for business yay and alvin has agreed to personally pay every worker their lost wages yeah that's where i like it yeah yeah don't you have an embassy to get to yeah i guess i do [Music] did you guys hear the random person go yay at one point now now the chance grapes back to work merchants should be open to trade outfit i should see if they have anything useful before i send what ease off to baron light i brought out only the good stuff for you red see it as you got that whistle blowing hey i've been waiting to get my lucky hammer fixed for days you haven't done anything useful like getting rid of any bristle backs though have you take your time i promise you won't be disappointed damn just shut it down [Music] acid trap smoke bomb fire hunter hello fire payloads that could burn enemies shark shot though like i'd like to buy the the fire i think you can sell stuff as well come back anytime i'm not going to sell anything just yet how can i get this fixed i can fix your tools afraid there's no fixing you this guy is just dropping bombs man wow [Music] but we'll talk soon can i upgrade my new bow and create jobs for it as well what oh okay so you can just set yourself a quest to get the required materials to upgrade specific things that you have chain scrape might not look like much but our forges are first right that's my stash fine day for poor singing i've heard of your adventures let's see this all my hair outfits so these have an effect on your stats nor a huntress critical strike and pyro sat so that's more like melee that's more like stealth go for that one look like a nerf gun okay ah it's a waste of arrows you heard the whistle time to go but but i i was supposed to have three escorts i'm off to baron lightwadis like eloy said captain's orders you can stay here abandoned to the riffraff i think not guess you're coming with me then see you there eloy it's gonna take a while [Music] you could help him i mean why not [Music] well now that that's done the embassy can finally get underway if i can get through it i'll be able to track down silence hades maybe even a guy at backup guess i could head straight for baron knight we'll poke around the dance some more first upgrade the uh the bow skill points maybe that prolongs your slow-mo basically [Music] passive boost machine master i'll go for that one build a vala faster fire a high arching volley of arrows to rain down on your enemies what okay and maybe take petra up on that drink we're gonna switch to resolution mode here switch between available weapon techniques for your current weapon by opening the weapon wheel l1 and tapping left or right outfit armor you can always get a new one you know it's cool all the way out there unknown hunting grounds you can travel there yeah you notice the difference don't you go down to 30 straight away how would i use that that's my mount you just run over here and died okay you can just kill it if you want that's horrible [Music] y'all mate you hope they release a pc for that would be sick um i don't think we'll get this on pc for a number of years being honest with you it's a very important playstation 5 exclusive and if you look at like god of war which i would put in the same category of importance that's 2018 and it's only just come out on pc nearly four years you know baron light last part of the sentence all right i should find whoever's in charge here but first i could resupply it my stash might be worth taking a look around too who's the boss where's aaron you've got a thick wall of stone between you and the tanaka up there yes sir are you in charge around here ah apologies no that would be commander nozar i'm lawan the second in command so what brings a lawyer of the nora to baron light i'm here for the embassy i need it to happen so i can head west and maybe now that studious wadis is here we can finally get things underway yes the sun priest walked in practically kicking and screaming behind his escort really seems to like his scrolls but the embassy remains delayed commander nozar has signaled our readiness but the tanakh marshals have yet to sound their horn all right fine let me through the gates then i have my own business with them i'm sure you do but i'm afraid i can't commander's orders normally the gates are open for any who dare to venture out asaram salvagers a few especially brazen karja but no one's allowed in or out before an embassy now we're open once the tanakh thumb left where is this commander nozar then if he's the one keeping the gates shut i'll convince him to open them for me i'll take you to him but i have to warn you the commander isn't one to break protocol especially when he's already high strung we'll see about that it's funny that this guy is called luan when we just played light 2 and they had a character the tanakh tore down this place during the red raids two years of labor we'll still have a long way to go the work stop isn't changing it clearly altered our rebuilding efforts but i hear a certain nora got them back to work i was just helping out yes well i'm sure alvin was thrilled whoa stand aside soldier sir move out of the way their own people much more can you expect from barbarians [Music] a lawyer was it yes the one who cleared the valley for you that eloy we appreciate your service at least we are ready for the embassy to begin didn't you just give the signal both sides must signal readiness until the tanakh sound their horn we wait yay for as the first shall be shut up why the delay the tanakh are tribe composed of three clans how many banners do you see you're just gonna wait go find out what's wrong oh this isn't some forgotten corner of the east where you come from it's a forbidden west if you don't like it run back to meridian file a complaint the meridian i saved you mean that's right nobody walks to the gate until the third clan arrives and the tanakh horn has sounded not even the savior of meridian uh i'm going now well thanks but i've waited long it's rude it's time to go absolutely not this embassy depends on diligent adherence to you shall not keep telling yourself foreign [Music] open the gates please let her through that gate that is a direct order sorry can't do it [Music] hey barbara hi erin uh what's happening i you know the usual aloy wants something people trying to stand in a way it's not gonna work that's it arrest her i'd like to see you try [Music] supporting fire yeah i'm locked unloaded hey nose off you stupid bastard you think you got the authority to keep that door shut in the savior of meridian's face what do you think sun king of vod is gonna do when he hears what you did promote you huh he's having a party they're through boys saving the world forget something back in meridian look it doesn't matter i made it just in time so this tribe that marat told us about the tanakh we need their permission to go west yeah well i figured it'd be nice if they weren't trying to kill me the whole time but this embassy hasn't started yet we're just gonna barge in no more politics no more delays oh well now at least you have some backup i guess i do we'll see how it goes back up send back up they look friendly that is the line between east and west cross it and die hold on now let's take it easy none may walk this valley until our signal sounds that was our accord with the karja i'm not karja i came here on my own to ask for right of passage but they opened the gate for you did they not what is the meaning of this violation why send a child do they want to parlay or not the karjar can't be trusted this is no i forget the batista this has nothing to do with them i need to go west to save lives maybe even yours the only lives you can save are your own by turning back now hold she's telling the truth about one thing she's not karja she's a nora from the savage east and if she seeks to save lives should we not listen let me speak to her one last favor for a fellow marshal before he's taken away a fearless red-headed nora you must be the so-called savior of meridian just eloy i am unyielding feshav once of the karja high command last of the army of the setting sun you all have to forgive my comrades tensions are high this embassy is a delicate affair they're about to return me to the sundom a gesture that might help soothe painful grievances and now you arrive unheralded i'm not here to cause trouble i just need to go west so you say i might be able to help but i need to know why along with some assurance that i won't regret it you asked why i need rite of passage i'll tell you but you won't like my answer six months ago the world almost ended in meridian that threat still exists it's getting worse every day much worse calling down storms poisoning the water enraging the machines the source of it all has gone west and i'm the only one who can stop it i've seen the signs and i've heard tales of incredible occurrences in meridian an army of demons vanquished by a red-haired champion yes ma'am so i'm inclined to believe you the burden of your task is written across your face clearer than any mark of mine i'll grant you this to serve as proof of your right to travel into tanakh lands a task so important and it's just the two of you take it from one who aspires to be a diplomat allies are essential chief akaro knows the west better than anyone he may be able to help you he can be intimidating to others but don't let that deceive you he is a man of his word maybe if i need him your choice you can find him at his palace pass the mountains to the southwest tell him i sent you and he'll listen to look the sky clans banner marshalls it wasn't easy but i brought the skyclan with me and the commander uh no i could only convince a few he isn't yet aware we left we have banners from all three clans if there are fewer from the sky clan it can't be helped he's right sound the horn what's going on not all tanakh can stomach the idea of parlay with the kasha but enough have come for us to begin then i'll be on my way no the other marshals were not permitted you wanted safe passage you have it after the embassy the carja have opened the gates uh [Music] as the sun rises over a land at war so too can it set over a land at peace today is such hear me marshalls you who claim to be tanakh regala chief akaro's biggest mistake a rival whom he should have killed you have forgotten that our people were born in blood the blood of the karja instead you pledge your spears to achieve who conspires with the enemy picaro has betrayed us the embassy is proof and all of you marshals are his accomplices for this i condemn you to death you'll need more than toothless threats to intimidate us exile that's angela bassett isn't it she's got some velociraptors lancers warm up the riding machines where'd they learn to do that silence vishav come with us now or not at all our turn light them up [Music] [Music] no [Music] rhinos i'm not

it in damn okay here they come don't stop those uh fires there's one oh those firearms are really good i use the acid arrows though on those green things i think that's gonna explode isn't it i'm gonna overload it cut them all down there it is that's really effective playing in fidelity mode christine you should be able to tell it's 30 fps right through the sternum i think oh my god just you and me now we've survived stuck in a corner yes that's what i wanted so it's gonna blow no one more good enough i hope we get to ride those raptors outlanders i'll skin you both [Music] chief grant me

load of resources here because i couldn't craft any additional arrows oh your turn come down here i don't think she will i think she's going to go away it was an honorable challenge you've earned your life today comrades mark this day today you have decimated the marshalls slaughtered the karja so begins our war honeycomb the chicken out i knew it get him to the camp now you're gonna make it you're going on without me aren't you because i'm stuck with aaron for now come on i'll take you back to the fort [Music] i got you it's salvage time boys [Music] here i don't think it can take a hit i should be able to use it to collide nice hey lloyd we're still trying to sort out this mess seems like the tanakh have a civil war in their hands it sounds about right the marshals weren't expecting regala to attack and the entire karja delegation was slain nozar voidis pashav a massacre what will you do now i have to head west hopefully this rite of passage is still good for what i'm after i'll cross all of tanakh territory if i have to then you have a long road ahead of you this is only the threshold of the forbidden west the tanakh's true domain lies over the mountains that border plain song home of the utaru tribe this isn't to knock the territory all that out there that's no man's land it was supposed to be neutral ground though obviously this regala ignored that her rebels approached from the north with all those machines they were riding they must have made camp up that way the rebels were riding bristlebacks and there were bristlebacks in the daunt are you saying the rebels let them into the dot how would that even be possible i don't know but it's worth looking into while you're at it there were a number of karja and asaram who went out there before the gates were shut for the embassy maybe you could check in on them see if they're all right i can keep an eye out is there a tall neck somewhere nearby a tall neck there's that one over there near the uttara border but why it's uh it's hard to explain it'll help me get the lay of the land if you say so is there anything else i can tell you before you go i need to be on my way then i wish you luck the gates will always be open to you should you wish to return and don't worry about your friends we'll get them patched up [Music] i'll be fine son watch over you eloy i hope you find what you're looking
