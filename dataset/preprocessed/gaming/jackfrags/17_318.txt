ladies and gentlemen introducing the c-58 this is one of the new assault rifles in warzone season four and it's nuts you can do things like this rocked up to a squad here two down straight away almost got killed there throughout the stun throughout the nade got a stick as well with that first one another down gonna reload so i maxed this out yesterday get up on the head glitch third fourth and that's it for the quad kill i love this gun i think it's awesome it's actually got a quicker time to kill than the amax and i think you're going to be seeing it a lot more because there's just so many more viable guns now in the game the mg82 i talked about that in the video that i did a couple days ago we know that's ruined it's stupidly overpowered raven actually made a tweet as well saying that they're gonna nerf it and i'd imagine that's coming on monday because i don't know if you played warzone the last couple days since the patch but that gun just absolutely rinses you but here's the build for the c58 if you want to copy it you could use a wrap instead of the grip at the front if you wanted to but i like this build works really well on pc i thought i'd show you this as well these are the red doors i missed this in my first video because i just didn't really see any of these and i had to go looking for him these are all around the level and when you go through them they teleport you to a completely different part of the map and into a room and in the room it's full of loot you get a load of money satchels i think there's a guaranteed advanced uav in there too but through natural play i didn't really find these but i jumped on a little easter egg hunt with geeky pastimes and a couple of mates and we were just looking at these seeing if there was anything weird with them but i think they just loot rooms and kind of connected to the black ops storyline with the numbers and everything but we'll see with that said i've got a great game for you that we recorded earlier today and it goes full sweat twitch rivals competitive at the end and we're up against it really because there's a team up the hill that has a really advantageous position on us and we start running out of plates we start running out of ammo lacking westy get killed so it's just me and stodd and it's really really intense game at the end it was good fun but nice balance here using that c58 great secondary for it is the mac 10 which i was using in this video or something like the bullfrog or the ppsh but now the amax has been nerfed i reckon this could be its replacement for me as always thank you for using my code in the cod store guys jackfrags in caps loads of you have tweeted pics saying you picked up the battle pass blueprints operators all that stuff cheers guys your absolute legends love you lots so here is an action-packed game for you if you like it leave a like let's get it what do you think is the least used gun in war zone uh [Applause] but no one takes the ksp because it's just hard to use what about the uh the deagle surely no one uses that i mean i could actually check if you want on the stats you could use that thing yeah go on have a look see what it is i'm interested i reckon it's something like it'll be a dlc weapon like the iso are there any other like incredibly bad smgs um the ic was pretty bad pp19 no it's not it's not the worst no but no one uses it because it just wasn't worth it i remember when wilson came out a lot of people were using it because it was like they met a weapon in modern warfare but it was just trash and yeah was that but they thought um i'll be killing warzone it just wasn't i remember the first meta no stock m4 those were the days yeah yeah those are the good days the good days before the dark times before the empire okay so the least popular weapon in warzone at the moment is the r1 shadowhunter the cross is there yeah that doesn't count though in terms of guns like him guns guns and v okay rose shotgun seven two really no way okay people use that's good yeah that makes sense striker 45 sks evr 14 mark 12 mark ii carbine type 63 origin 12 et cetera et cetera yeah i just found one it's the car 98 followed by the mg82 followed by the a max jack's in the meme over a car park yeah there's a ladder over here that was rude putting the c4 down two above me they're not moving okay [Applause] oh they are moving now they're on my level oh man this thing is insane the teacher can it's nuts so quick he's on the bottom down red marker oh my god what was that jump that looks so weird in my game isn't this based off hijack and black ops two it's black ops two wasn't it [Applause] nice one jack is there anyone on the train yes there is people actually there just one guy on the train there's a motorbike on the airfield [Music] hey nice jack you absolutely beamed him jack no i don't need to waste that do i keep you know one bullet definitely there was fighting going on in the compound down here [Applause] come on yes it does work at this range oh yeah we have to go far anyway look at that we're gonna have to use the truck you either ah oh they're in the gondola they're in the gondola broke him oh dude what this thing is insane yeah it's very very powerful isn't it drunk in the compounds yeah up on the hill up on the hill oh absolutely legendary shot again guys up on the radio tower careful let's not throw let's not throw it nice throw out yeah i'll be back from behind keep going keep going don't expose the back of the truck yeah bloody hell it's a bit of a twitch ride was fine i'm not going to last year we drove through three teams warfare then there's nothing we have no place do we no i got nothing we need that built we need their building that's what we made yeah we now have no plates and anything you just kill just some random dude though it's prone broke one in the window there on the top floor or downed one sorry up here on the hill guys i'm purple another team there you got the zone again i'm keeping an eye on this team that are here did any of you guys hit him or was that just me that was just you jack just you know what that was so quick they're all out of gas they're all out of zone again though you could wait face just wait 30 seconds one over here to the northeast like they have to press you guys can you see his head what's that's right i'm moving broken i do they push these buildings yeah they push me out again there's not much i can do yes got him north of these he's looking through that with a light okay no there's nothing i could do i literally had nothing was the outsider inside cam inside he pushed me he pushed me i've got 11 shots todd wait we if we kill this guy we can get his loot and we need it can you stand the door open then throw our thermite in uh hold on double stack okay you ready you beaming right side you just see forward me i broke him yeah he's got no place good job hang on now building it me up i think he's upstairs you sure come with me come with me [Applause] dude the worst thing is they're dropping they have no place yeah right what about that guy in the other building we can maybe do something about him and nobody has plates do you need ammo sod um what do you need let's plate this across the crease and it's gone to them and they can stay in the building they can actually stay in the window of the building i hit one i mean we ruined only like well you do have the most powerful gun in stod's hands but there's also one guy in the building to our left so can you get in there it's three places oh he's pushing that push and the pushing the pushing they pushed them yeah they're fighting but now it's your chance there's no plates though no there'll be no place there'll be no place at all the only one might be on no you'll be none now is your chance to close the gap that's our airstrike 2v2 v3 yeah hold hold hold this window or 2v4 v1 maybe you guys to the right i'm just watching he's shooting someone saw a riot they're dead you can hold you can hold this position you've got to go before i've got one done i've got two stuns be careful because they now could push out and just take you i've tell me that i'm down nice nice nice two down that's two down oh my start surely have you done that last guy last guy come in all right on the right right he's full behind me [Applause] how do we keep pulling this off that's three in a row three in a row three in a row and like in a row we've been chalked at the end of every round full sweat that was one that was sweaty that was really sweaty i think if i didn't have that stone i wouldn't have won there because he had the high ground and he had cover rn jesus was has shined down upon us on a saturday afternoon in the building decided to push up and fight them in the film yeah yeah that was a silly mistake i mean that's that's el hatrick you
