hi everyone and welcome back to battlefield 2042. today i'm going to be playing rush for the first time and this is actually the first time that i've played online since the patch earlier in the week so i'm looking forward to seeing what the game's like now most people that i've spoken to about rush have said that it's pretty good so it'll be interesting to jump in and test see how it plays but i'm looking forward to it thank you for coming along tonight guys if you enjoyed the stream if you watch this as a video make sure to drop a like down below thank you it's a great way to help support me appreciate you guys also i have to say a big thanks to epic games for sponsoring this one if you guys pick up any games on the epic game store do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that and rush is actually part of portal at the moment but please correct me if i'm wrong but i think they've enabled xp and stuff in portal again well let me know in the comments if it actually is back like xp leveling up your guns and everything like that in portal i read that online i don't know if it's true but let me know either way we've also got sniper and knives in portal which we'll try a bit later on this is a game mode that was made by stodd so i'm interested to try this it's an old-school game mode it's kind of similar to one in the chamber in a way you only get two bullets and a knife of course every time you get a kill you get ammo to make those shots counts it feels like it's the perfect kind of game mode that stod would put together also i'm nearly level 60 so i've almost got the last unlock which is the ntw sniper rifle i used it a bit in the capture event but i didn't really get much chance to play the game at all then and there was just like one round where i was using that sniper rifle so i'm gonna test it in the main game but to start with we're going to be playing rush rush of course classic game mode i think the best version of rush was in bad company 2 because those maps were designed specifically for rush and they just flowed so nicely but as i just mentioned a lot of my friends people that i'm in touch with regularly who play a lot of 2042 said that rush is actually quite good in 2042 so it's on those maps but we'll jump into the game now get playing see for ourselves looking forward to it thanks again for coming along tonight hope you've all had a fantastic weekend so far uh emily thank you for the 20 months appreciate that memberships are back on the channel now by the way we had a bit of a blip last week i had to leave my network but we're back now memberships are working again and if you become a member you do get access to the discord server and of course you can use those remotes and get loyalty badges if that's your thing completely optional of course so what we clean okay so this might be an interesting map it's quite flat though isn't it i feel like sundance is just going to be really good although i'm defending to start with what weapon should we use guys very infantry focused rush might go with the m5 to start with see how we fare so i don't know any of these layouts i haven't played any games today either i've been out and about today so uh it's gonna be interesting is that a there's a mav right outside isn't there [Music] what if i get in this get on the gun i did actually unlock all the weapons for this lat v so i've got the 50 millimeter not really used it though apart from against some bots so i'm not aware of its effectiveness against players but the minigun's pretty good oh there's a guy here you know what i actually went to press c there to heal myself you know like in bf5 you get a health back you press c on pc that is and you can heal yourself i tried to do it then i mean the game feels like it's running quite well i think that's probably because it's less players isn't it how many players is rush in this right so we've got a lot more i know yeah we've got a lot more defending than attacking right now is it 32 players guys enemy charges have been defused it's cool that the anti-armor grenades actually lock onto the turrets the turret is considered to be armor for some reason i suppose it is in a way right can i call anything in nope can't use the menu 16b16 okay so it's old school 32 players then that's what the mcom looks like check that out eight seven two one four do you reckon that's an easter egg or just a bit of set dressing maybe yeah my game is running really well i feel like i'm getting good fps what fps am i actually getting um render.draw is it that one render no it's not that what's the command to show fps draw is it perf overlay enable one damn it i forgot what it is guys what's the command draw fps one no that didn't do anything draw off overlay that's not working oh there we go okay you have to close the console yeah thank you guys oh my god there's all sorts on the screen right now why didn't i just do um great gameplay here i could have just put my geforce experience up couldn't i i'm actually getting 150 fps what the hell this guy here how do i get rid of that bit at the top now what the hell's that it looks like hacks or something oh f4 yeah that doesn't work guys sorry scott thank you for becoming a member now i've just got some hacks on the screen one of those commands that i put in yeah that's it i think yeah there we go goodbye rush is boring yeah fair enough i mean this oh hello mav what's up suck on that they're not really doing a very good job of attacking are they i've got smoke grenades as well stop texting my dad i'm not texting your dad it's not me it's someone else i don't know your dad i'm sorry why is it yeah they added that as well it was in the patch notes i don't know if it works so i've not been killed yet but apparently you can see when i met it's going to come from a five view [Music] everything's just shouted is rush like front lines from bf5 no rush is um like rush it's basically two m com stations that the attacking team have to destroy and if you're defending you have to stop the defending but as you can see they've only got 14 tickets left so they're not gonna do it [Music] 128 player maps run this well like the mouse actually feels good for once yeah they really didn't do a very good job of attacking here the sensor balls yeah people are gonna be using them loads on this seven tickets i prefer to attack on rush it's way more fun i used to anyway unless you're sniping sniping can be quite fun when you're defending our tactics were superior today there we go victory is ours i mean that was an easy first game wasn't it nine kills in the back hey james ripley upgrading to 12th gen intel soon yeah i've got a new pc coming next week james it's sick it's like absolute top spec i'm just going to try and brute force the frame rate because the performance on conquest is awful so i reckon if i just you know get the best possible system maybe i can get 150 fps on conquest fingers crossed i've seen some videos on youtube uh calf thank you for the 18 months kino what's up man how you doing kino jasper 128 players was a mistake i've seen a lot of people say that jasper you know i know that they're gonna bring 64 player conquest and breakthrough back hopefully they're permanent additions so broken an extra squad or two would make this perfect do you mean a couple more players in the lobby broken or do you mean just like playing with two squads or something what's 12 gen i'm getting the 12 900k 12 the spec is pretty much 12 900 k 32 gig ddr5 um asus strix 3090 two m2 ssds 1200 watt power supply it's all liquid cooled overclocked i'm really looking forward to it so thank you for the five months i'm defending again i don't want to defend again i'd like to attack now i've got the war hawk yeah it's the wrong objectives and setup control of the sectors we're loading yeah very few issues on the xbox one x that's cool john pc's um really ropey so far i mean playing on this map with a decent frame rate my brain isn't working i'm i'm just like this isn't this isn't right why haven't i got good fps it's weird [Music] overclocked yeah it'll be pretty overclocked a company called pc specialists are doing it for me they're building all usually i build my own pc but um i can't buy ddr5 anywhere i can't get it all the system builders are just keeping it for themselves you know fair enough because you know if you're a system builder you want to build systems and you can't do that without memory right so i think a lot of them are just keeping the memory but uh yeah it'd be nice um when it turns up oh my god i'll do a setup video and everything you know when it when it comes because i haven't done a set of videos since 2019 because i haven't really changed much since then to be honest that's a boris turret wasn't it don't switch quick enough how many players in rush 32 above muhammad apparently uh muscle man if you claim free games my creative code do i get anything no but you should do it anyway muscle man because it shows epic that people are using my code so that's cool like if you want to use it on free stuff go ahead man it helps me out honestly thank you that maria might revive me again what's the company name pc specialist boys okay so they are attacking this they've actually managed to hang on was it dead body shoot oh no it's just a peak inside the dead body i was confused there i felt like a dead body was shooting me uh clark thank you for the 15 months you watched the f1 race yeah kicks apparently the f1 was crazy today i was out i've been out all afternoon so i didn't get a chance to to watch it um apparently there was a lot of drama i have to catch up on the highlights i need to get a zip line maybe i should switch to mckay perhaps don't die on me paul mckay is asleep i don't really know this area than that you're an enemy oh man it's so nice to play a good fps like i can actually aim at stuff it's a bit weird though i mean no complaints like the gunplay works what's going on do you think they'll actually manage to get it optimized for 128 players i hope so get across here that guy saw me just going to wait for my health to come back emp grenade what year is it who does that the race was crazy go go it's between hamilton and max isn't it that's been the drama this season there's been all sorts of like crashes and weird calls and stuff right like it's uh i need to watch drive to survive everyone tells me that's awesome i knew it it's just sensibles everywhere go high again high height i don't quite get an angle on that other guy down there we're losing where did you come from okay use the spider-man trick it was my emp was it this falc is great thank you oh no res again oh oh no dead dead no coming back from that i'm going to switch to mckay this could be in a better position couldn't it [Music] [Music] right really aka is not great at that distance casper what are you doing okay so defending is quite easy so far another good round in the back is this on portal yeah it is graph but this is an official game mode so apparently the guys in chat said you get xp and everything what's up alfonso 1000 likes yeah if you're enjoying the stream guys hit the like button thank you sam what's up man great video yesterday was nice to see some warzone content yeah yeah i mean next week is going to be great like new map i'm really looking forward to it andy what's up i'm new to online gaming do you have a top tip when playing just enjoy it andy don't take it too seriously we're level 60. that means i've got the ntw let's go how do you look at your scoreboard on console jack um i think you just press the options button but it's it's a different scoreboard to what we've had in the past like this game doesn't really have a typical battlefield scoreboard so what's up cheeseburger cod better bgt fast games yes indeed have i tried nvidia image scaling ashab no i haven't hey dongga what's up gabby alex matt how you doing man matt is eating a baked ziti what's a zt i've never heard of that before matt hey scott been watching since bf three days defending again i try sniping then soon as we're defending all the time um that's the new sniper i've just unlocked it try it out oh my god what the oh that's really slow abs speed the enemy will try to push looks great is that you is it i mean that's not a bad way to start with the ntw 50 is it i missed it i was going to try and get a kill with every single shot that sounds incredible guys that sounds so good it's got such a slow rate of fire though [Music] oh my god i love that sound it is the worst scope though yeah you're right you know i'm impressed though they got the two points there really quickly dude is it supposed to be this good what the hell it's literally my first time using it in the main game i love this thing it's awesome i need to get a better spot than this yeah they kept the whoop whoop didn't they are we going at the top then okay um maybe this isn't the best spot but i'm gonna stick out like a sword then it's okay oh good shot svk ruin me it's primarily for use against vehicles i mean i know that it's got anti-vehicle rounds in it right how many kills we get then six did i unlock anything for it probably not um you can click on these now oh my god they've actually made it so you can just click on them but i still okay so that's an improvement but when i'm here i want to instead of having to click back just let me click on a different category because my brain is like jack you can click this but you just can't explosive charges richie thank you for the 13 months has it crashed my game's crashed i think we've crashed that's a shame i was enjoying that f in the chat guys it back up again still get crashes every now and again that sucks maybe we can attack bro [Music] that's a lot of f's can we get 7000 f's right now 7 400 f's in the chat it is what it is happened to me a few times since update three okay try again that's a new sound as well isn't it after the patch youtube is going to think my stream is just like full of bots or something though i need to i need to use that sniper some more man this thing is sick whoa it's a bit stuttery okay it's actually marking you guys as spam now so stop stop with the s please guys i think that's enough f's for battlefield right there see now i should switch to sundown shouldn't i i think there's an mav here right oh come on it's around the corner there guys need to take out that movie i like that squad as well the the felt character in the squad was actually really great medic oh well i'm sure i'll see them again one day okay we gotta actually destroy this mav because they're using that as a spawn point i feel like movies are going to be key in rush oh that's so good literally throws them to death i'm medusa maybe he's gone oh that's sound man that has to be the best sounding gun in the game right is there a better sounding gun in the game than that this thing doesn't have excessive bullet drop on it though that's the downside right love that song oh no okay so if you've got armor it's not a one shot but that's the counter to it you don't want to be one shot by an ntw you take armor better sounding going anything from bf1 bf1 did has some cracking sounds in it to be fair martini henry oof so good enemies down i feel like you could just make a sick montage with this oh nice shot imagine the amount of one-shot kills you could get imagine that going with dismemberment night hunter you know now you've said that are the things working look bottom right it actually tells me there was a medic nearby [Music] yeah it reminded me of the intervention from mw2 when you said that though i'm not sure that did that have dismemberment on it i think it did this guy here i'm right there as well bravo i go to the roof i feel like that shot just went through that player maybe i wasn't aiming high enough oh yeah this sniper is just all about moving isn't it you take that shot and then you move i can't wait for a new scope though because this one is uh particularly awful not a fan of the scope do reload tanka bear yep as far as i'm aware from recollection i don't think battlefield has ever had proper dismemberment has it i don't remember a battlefield game that has dismemberment in look at this guy that's the only acceptable angel skin right there like i reckon i reckon bf one could have had it but it didn't is that boris dead they need to fix that glitch man so annoying oh my god guys this gun is nuts what the hell why aren't more people talking about this thing what the like this is insane isn't it am i crazy like this thing is nuts ah fair play sneaking up on us i unlocked a new scope did i which one did i unlock there's no medics around what's up latin thank you for 15 months appreciate that buddy it's very kind here oh they planted it she sheesh let's have a look this what is this eight times okay you would think that the eight times was unlocked automatically but apparently not let's have a look all right it's just a classic eight times 80 sp's on that is a lot quicker than the one that i just had what's the bullet drop going to be like now get used to it again sheesh let's hello sheesh get him with the battlefield theme i can hear classical music playing oh if i go to the roof oh jazz music did i have the music off before i've never heard this before that's good that's some good music right there i like that oh this is the bot farming spot right here they don't have many reinforcements left they don't have many reinforcements left and that bullet travels very slowly if we're up here they're gonna win although they've only got seven tickets so and that pokeball back i mean victory is ours it's three in a row i have been defending though every time how's the performance um carol slaw i'm getting great fps on rush it's only 32 players the cookie monster el alamein is straight up weird to play in portal i played it in conquest i had a good time with uh matimo playing now on main we were just driving around in jeeps trying to explode stuff they are nerfing prox grenades are they done is that why they're everywhere on the ground hey intron what's up hello kyle kiko welcome to the stream thank you for coming alex have i been stream sniped yet no i haven't need a full 64. i think 64 players would be too much for rush with these map sizes anyway does this game feel empty do you mean does this game feel empty i mean sometimes the maps can feel a bit empty matt yeah there's not much in between things you know a lot of flat ground hopefully they improve the base maps in the live service that's something they did in bf5 you know they went back and changed some of the maps so i don't see why they wouldn't do it here okay right we're sniping this time so this is what we played first but we were just using the m5 but now we're gonna snipe sws would be better though wouldn't it the enemy will try to maybe objectives and control the sectors where they spawn yeah they're gonna get that maven aren't they interesting turret there i think that's quite a good spot oh this scope is very zoomed in oh right at the back i got counter nw50 ntw 50. i'd like to i'd like to attack it just seems to be putting me on defense the whole time what's going on it's nice that i can see when medics are around come on donkey let's go donkey i can see you donkey you got five seconds don't get donkey donkey from shrek no wonder he didn't remind me um maybe i should switch ac for a bit it's bugged is it really i want to attack i don't want to defend [Music] what are you firing up [Music] the enemy has neutralized objective oh nice shot objective ntw 50 okay so it's a one-hit kill then like i said earlier if you don't have armor it seems like it's a one-hit kill oh geb gibb thank you for becoming a member that's a great lots of people have had with it jack you get on one side and you seem to get unless you quit and re-cue okay well i'll re-queue then after this game hey larry what's up yeah i much prefer to attack their explosives no no no no no you think the ntw 50 will be a problem when more people unlock it and everyone can just get one bangs cool my rocket went through that i think it just went through the middle bad idea didn't expect someone on the roof how many people in rush 32 i'm not going to get a risk here am i not on the roof voiceover ip it's not in yet will it's not in the game yet sadly are you in combat come on dude can i blow that up i don't know a lot of people in there i love this gun so good crazy to actually have a good burst gun in a battlefield game don't often get that i can miss you hold up oh no sniper there looking at me okay i think i'm outside my welcome here you know the reason they would take out voiceover ip i just don't think it was ready marcel they just should have delayed the games uh a bit longer there's a lot of features that weren't in at launch voice over ip's one of them a bipod better watch out on the left because it's going to be a sniper i think that's not round i might as well try and use this then i don't have ammo it's only dead dare i go closer i should turn it around shouldn't i i turn it around they can't snipe snipe me they can they can snipe me mid turn good shot what's up gabe gabe thank you for becoming a member dude glad to see you having at least some fun in battlefield catch you live in the member can't wait to do it again it's very kind here thank you what do i think about the progression in 2042 i think there needs to be a lot more will it there needs to be a lot more primary weapons i mean i know that for a fact like 22 is quite quite low my helicopter what the hell why is that there whose helicopter is this uh come on my game just closed nice okay so that guy actually blew me up so hard that it closed my game that's cool that's cool yeah i think they should as i was saying about progression there should at least be like another maybe two assault rifles another two lmgs one more sniper one more dmr there's not that many secondaries either really angster thanks for becoming a member yeah that helicopter was weird man nice cursed i got i got the helicopter i got blown up and then my game closed helicopter helicopt i've heard that everywhere that's one hell of a rocket you're done right [Music] character got sent to the desktop blown out of the game does this put me back i'm attacking all right okay good fresh lobby attacking he can't make that up yeah that's powerful whiplash yeah that dude has got a gun a rocket launcher that's so powerful if it kills you you leave the game come on then take me to paradise mav let's go what is that big cannon on the front these boys up here come on take me where i can shoot some people that's not that's not what i meant oh there that sounds cool put me in coach there's a guy here in the dead it's still there bro i'm sure there's someone there there's literally a guy here [Music] how's going on well that's a way to get the point isn't it at least families have destroyed objective alpha good job with the mav buddy wait it's still alive how did i die i was in it i was literally inside it the hell reload nice please just let me reload the damn gun i need to take hills or something there's a guy up here and there was dice why is that why is that mechanic force open what so they can they can lock it from the inside there is that what happened then yes trip come on trip let's go please kill them first oh my g the timing the timing guys what what is that door thing man it's crazy all right let's try the mov again it won't first time just got to put it on the b point everything will be fine don't no you give that position away all right take me to b i'm sorry the the jack rabbit i mean what's the smoke i can't see if the smoke dude oh no you've ruined me please okay they've actually just got out right now that's it shoot i'm sure i'm gonna go put it on the objective oh god i actually hate this meccano advanced vehicle simulator that only happens on pc what only happens on pc come on charlie i don't think we're gonna get this one guys it's gonna be the first failure of the day how many tickets we got 10 now there's nowhere seems like it's quite difficult to without these first two points on breakaway smokes would be good though someone said in chat you know it's a good shot you crashed a hole in the wall and then tried the door did i make a hole chris i didn't even realize i made it oh hard work pays off sometimes i never see anyone play as well spectacular yeah i really don't like those doors man not a fan of those i've just learned a new mechanic and i hate it did you know you can grapple the smoke from smoke grenades i've seen that a few times gavin yeah i've seen a video as well where someone throws a sensor ball up into the air and then grapples onto that so maybe we should test that because that could be you could do something like insane sniper shots with that right like quake 3 style jump up into the air shoot someone manifest okay yeah the voice lines are terrible night hunter like they need to like completely rewrite some of the characters the 20 millimeter on the map does almost no damage to infantry needs a bit of a buff maybe does the kill feed not work no i've changed it so it only shows nearby king is bf1 still worth buying yeah it is but i if you um if you want to play bf1 you should just get uh ea play or xbox game pass so sensible i just want to try this so you have to throw it up we have to destroy their objectives get control of the sectors and keep pushing the enemy back maybe i was too slow then oh my god it actually works okay right that's that's really interesting i can't believe that works what the hell i've got i've got to make a montage doing that man that'd be sick explosives shoot eddie tango who gets nero trying to shoot my rocket down there i can't believe that's the thing guys that's kind of sick though the fact that you can do that come on folk you got me look at that pro medic smoking let's climb hello can go down gunny see if we can defend this he's friendly it's gonna come on blow friendly good objective job okay one more grenade so i can mess around right underneath me heading out oh no nice sorry make sure they detonate i need help i'm gonna get this surely there we go what's all these dead bodies that are just like not real yeah right check this out here we go both objectives have been destroyed gonna do a rocket a rocket sensor ball you ready for this area there we go g gotcha that's that's that's the player right there guys that's how we do it that's the tactic although if i do it really high do really high up and then use a sniper rifle i'm okay so fun oh where'd you come from it's a mckay of course what's up sam the man this is the most fun you've had in battlefield 2042 in rush i mean i think the best thing for me is the performance like it actually runs well jack weed what a legend actually came up and resume reloading now threat neutralized oh come on you should have died can you grapple a rocket drasico i don't know should we test i think i don't know i don't think you could grapple your own rocket because by the time you fire it and switch back to your grapple it would be too far away to grapple but i mean i'm willing to try let's try no it's go it goes too quick i think maybe we could test with a teammate's rocket might work with the teammate if you got the angle of it right and then you can just just fly away on the rocket [Applause] objective good work up we go i can't i can't wait to test this out some more man this is a thing like this is actually a thing i like this a lot imagine like hitting a helicopter or a jet doing that that's so sick yeah grapple someone else's rocket jazz sure yeah ps2 graphic i'm playing all i know richard it's all i know i'm just trying to get as much fps as possible really can you grapple onto air vehicles yeah you can what about grabbing a drone i don't see why not holding out i don't see why you couldn't grapple a drone if you got a teammate to fly it yeah that'd work bro a grenade was lethal charge is set gone let's go up here oh it's gone right there i think we've got this one i was uncle's mom i'm sure she's fine i haven't spoken to her for a while let's go on the roof there let's have a go right okay i'm gonna try and rocket the guy on the roof ready i hit him but he didn't kill him i'm just like making myself into a clay pigeon that's what i'm doing right now when you die do you hear the half-life 2 death sound there's definitely some half-life 2 kind of sounds here yeah rush has no objective yeah the objective is two m-com stations jeff you have to go and blow them up penguin no i don't think you could grapple the penguins you can't interact with the penguins at all i missed it though you do just end up ruining yourself though i mean you know it is what it is good fun though down okay a little sensible there i'll get rid of that come on defend yes what's up agent do you think you'll check out tarkov 12.12 in the upcoming weeks new map um i haven't really followed it to be honest i uh i need to brush up on it has there been like a big update recently nice you need to watch your ass mate got one that's right behind me that's a quick res man they sped that up i feel like they sped that up i gotta get to b it doesn't really matter that the enemies underneath me there because we just need to take out b i've always wondered what this part of the map was for now i know it's for rush you think i can grapple onto a molotov wouldn't it just kill me if i did that though apparently i've taken out objective bravo it would wouldn't it destroyed we now can try what what that was the smoke okay that was a smoke so you can grapple smokes as well hey jack weed i'm coming for you bro don't worry i'm dead i'm dead that went really high as well then i'm getting all sorts of ideas here guys all sorts of ideas sherrock it's it's a little bit better thank you um it's not fixed though which is bad i don't think it's ever gonna be fixed playing objectives in battlefield yeah i try my best gin you know thank you rush is it new since the new patch a few days ago sky i've just not had a chance to play 260 degrees 70 meters away from my position hang on you could i know because you can't play as uh you can't get the grapplers sundance i was just thinking you could like grapple and then wingsuit to just get some height from the ground wouldn't work though with it what these guys doing here i need some ammo hey david sure you can bud sure you can you're here for the memes good good rush seems like the most coherent experience pretty good so far retro i enjoyed it is that an osprey condor ah this team are good you get the win that was it that's it it's over we're feeding them kill someone with the grapple it's the two hit yeah it is i've killed a few people with the grapple grapple on to other parachutes oh that's interesting don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes please angel could you just stop existing it's like the most annoying skin as well [Music] [Music] just try and tell us about russian bf3 metro daman pig best rush maps yeah you're right matec those maps were amazing for rush down my van peak like you get the first sector up on the hill then you push down a bit get the next two and then you do the base jump oh aaron patterson thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly well they bring back cte i don't think so khalid adam get your mate to throw a homemade and grapple on it adam this is a great all the there's some great ideas here hardcore metro bf3 metro rush on bf3 was awesome i remember playing that in the alpha don't be sad don't be sad sometimes it just works out that way don't be don't be sad please angel can we just stop think about the children hoping they bring their f4 to paul i mean they could bring any bf game to paul couldn't they why not right they've done 1942 bc2 bf3 they're all different games why not bf4 bf1 hardline you know whoa there were a lot of people there we need you hold on now johnny's in johnny's my mate oh there was another one on the right i'm blind didn't even close it but close enough yeah you know what i mean bg johnny johnny there's a man there oh my god so skip i'm gonna skip you can actually grapple onto a puff of smoke yeah i haven't tested that yet if i was gonna get kicked out the game then johnny oh you can't resonate i think c5 time is johnny still alive that someone's alive here okay please okay johnny watch out okay i think i can get him here we go you ready for this big play coming up big play he's over there enemy vehicle let's throw the smoke grapple no it didn't work i missed as well how embarrassing we'll get them next time don't worry i wonder if johnny could help me test some of these things that we could grapple onto why am i in single fire mode what did i select that i don't think i selected that that sucked okay [Laughter] okay i can't go over that way anymore why am i in single fire i suppressed it accidentally hang on is there inertia dude i'm just trying to test things bro leave me alone like to see the baby you know like i'm not interested in if you stay there i'm gonna shoot you again and you're gonna explode okay fine ow the enemy has described our explosives no i missed i missed the opportunity where's that that just came out of my face yeah we're not going to get this one only got a few tickets left science that must look so funny from the other team yeah they just see a man like fly up in the air from nowhere it must look so really really stupid like so dumb i think we've resigned ourselves to defeat here that's nine tickets remaining the only acceptable thing to do is try and hit some sick snipes hey they absolutely owned us this much they'd really well why is your m5 different from what i have in the game what do you mean santa back it's a skin enjoy these moments when they come hanno are you still in touch with andersel i haven't spoke to anders for years i hope he's all right a good day's work but i'm not one to brag a good day's work but i'm not want to br maria please frank's the eternal childlike scientist seeking knowledge of gaming physics and memes you're done right oh we got a new member as well spelk thank you for becoming a member did they fix the dxr i don't know i haven't used it since the patch is it broken hi johnny i just want to test if i can grapple onto a rocket that you fire are you still in my squad when we start just stand next to me fire a rocket and i'm going to see if i can grapple onto it are you playing as taika waititi he looks more like jake gyllenhaal what's up express how you doing they all look so plasticky i mean i've got it all on low like it's like absolute potato level graphics um here johnny all right get a rocket launcher a grenade yeah go on and push them further that didn't work try again no rocket launcher okay i think he's going to redeploy oh this guy's got one wait hang on okay go yeah i'm ready try again really hard hold on i stand here you stay there get to that position okay go johnny that's too quick it's another that's a note from me trying to predict that taking fire my name's mckay and i'm ready to play what's up mckay nice shot buddy okay right you think you think you're clever you think okay i bet you've never seen i bet you've never seen a counter sniper do this have you i'm just gonna spot that roof get moving okay here we go here we go it's always like too slow on the first one all right we do it from here away we go oh no we had armor on that would have been a kill that would have been a kill i swear like i had armor on i feel sad inside part of me died today all right age mckay and i'm ready to play i remember mckay from toy story he was great in that oh stephen you're welcome ow dude i can hear someone near me johnny i need some meds thank you johnny's such a good medic oh no johnny oh no no no no no no no no no no no can you even shoot through this the guy this guy like there somewhere i'm trying to like come on dice please i don't have enough fine control to get the right position i need a controller why are they just going for it what the hell it would have been a collateral too yeah talks that would have been great wouldn't it that would have been a clip i will hit one of those though i swear maybe if i had the dxr because the dxr is always a one shot isn't it so let's see see if i can find a sniper to shoot i'm not playing the objective at all but i don't really care to be honest what's it bobbin johnny's a medic to steal all the drugs johnny's the best medic our reinforcements are getting scarce johnny it's risky i know johnny's gonna go for it though watch this watch this got eight seconds johnny dead he tried you know can't blame him can't blame him for trying these spawn beacons are good though oh my god here's me i'm just trying to hit clips you know that nearly killed me um we go up here sometimes it doesn't work i feel like with the first one it's a bit hit and miss like 50 50. johnny's dead again we are pulling out the enemy it's a one-shot if they don't have armor paddock i mean i was one-shotting loads of people earlier at the start shopkin would be fun to say yeah i'm ready for a run too i wonder if you could like could you be quick enough to throw it like a 45 degree angle and grapple on it and then do an arc that kind of thing [Music] i'm reading you i'm reading the chat general that's where i'm reading the comments from and the questions up saka hey heart so battlefield fan [Music] is this hardcore no it isn't grappled to smoke i wonder if smoke's more reliable than the sensor yeah dxr is not a one shot the ntw 50 is the dxr can one shot you within like 30 meters though to the chest if you don't have armor we tested it so if i go smoke and if i pick it's going to be difficult though with the ntw 50 because it takes ages to scope in touch my monkeys in them in this vehicle interesting they're destroying their objectives keep pushing the enemy back play more halo your last gameplay was entertaining thank you man it's very kind you say that logan let's try it's really inconsistent the first time you do it it doesn't work usually the second time see every time i will actually play the game today guys i'm sorry i'm just you know when i find a stupid mechanic like that i like to test it wow okay a shot matthias yeah everything's on low i've got a config on as well so it looks uh it looks really bad but my fps is pretty good on rush i don't really care about graphics in like competitive fps games i'd much rather have good performance so the mouse actually feels good jack weed thank you it's a vector isn't it johnny i need to get an assault rifle i'm sorry i'm just messing about with snipers all the time i'm good arturo thank you right we'll switch it up now we'll actually play the game playing the game i can't oh my god i can't look up and down oh there we go let's get going please turn to the encasement area oh my god the entire squad just came up there rush is now in official mode yeah it is i mean i do i do care about the crashes christian i mean there's just nothing i can do about them like what can i do hopefully they fix it what more can i say i mean it is what it is what the hell why did i see a red dot there someone invisible there what's going on how far can i go here go right up to the corner never on the roof on there no no no no oh why did he have to see me that was the fight well rush stay i hope so jenna it's quite fun man i've been enjoying it so far am i looking to new battlefield friend episodes yeah for sure i'm sure they're going to come up with some really fun stuff we'll just go get b it's always difficult though when uh you know there's only one left everyone focuses on [Music] what's the guy doing back there with the scar just defending can't blame him for that get down what's the assault rifle skin called um i'll show you i think it was part of the uh the ultimate edition a good day's work but i'm not one to brag [Music] you mean the one for the m5 this one looks completely different doesn't it yeah this is low matthew is russia custom map no paradise it's official what's up shapeshifter how you doing man is there a meme gun i'm not really paul no not really you mean like the calibri yeah i feel like um proc senses are a big issue here because you everyone just spams them and you're constantly spotted it's such a beautiful skin it's a nice skin spoof yeah i like the fact that it's different though you know that's the most important thing for me with cosmetics that they look physically different they're not exactly the same it's um this one here obsidian it's called i've got a dinosaur charm i've not knocked many others there not many in the game and keep pushing the enemy back weird skin it looks different what's up daniel how's it going man hey breacher karma milson is the last girl mark we played that um like that couple weeks ago it was uh it was interesting we thought it on rush i'd like to play on conquest though and i think you know maybe it needs to be tweaked a little bit but i'm sure that they've messed around with it since i last played it it was like two weeks ago isn't it i need to switch that remember your training ain't too aggressive here i think hey kevin um i think the biggest difference in this game mode i've noticed is uh no not really any helicopters i don't know why that helicopter was there on the other map i feel like it shouldn't have been the other one that crashed my game we need smokes ak versus m5 ak ak is way see if better can defend this it's cheaper grenades man keep healing me johnny let's go legend good chills that the enemy put down here reloading yeah i might try the ak next match maybe get my try hard on still only for high-end pcs um yeah like i i wouldn't want to be playing this on a uh mid to low range spec can't be a nice experience oh they really didn't defuse that i know they did we armed it again very nice i'm going to stay here under these stairs this is the player right here literally don't have any ammo left they're on the roof aren't they we're gonna get that why is the ak better it's damage damage profile's a lot bigger depends how you play though doesn't it like the m5 you can put that smg magazine in it can be really strong but that's what i had when i did that little flying back then i will wait for you jack weed can you even res me here oh there was a player there what i didn't even see him charlie mike hey fbs on high with a 30-60 yeah that's pretty bad in my opinion i'm reloading get up johnny tango down i'm reloading i think they can be on the roof there can they not sure they're shooting at me 230 degrees oh this is bigger than open ground isn't it dangle try that do i use nvidia reflex yeah you can ping when you down yeah you spot people interesting map design here like no cover whatsoever the ram speed is really important that's true very true let's climb do this ah i'll get you moving hold on in terms of cover well we have no cover yeah there's none there yeah i've heard a lot of people complain about aim assist on console as well tank just came and smashed us all there airplay hopefully guys can look into that because i know they've lost a lot of console players because the aim assist just sucks like playing on controller apparently is awful can i go up to the top and wingsuit there's not an elevator there is there is that disabled why is that disabled i want to winx it off is that even a repel i don't know probably not you've left the engagement area we need you back um yeah i should put the short barrel on if i'm going smg ammo to be fair you can't use the calling system either johnny i'm sorry i don't know why you spawned on me it's my it's my fault please forgive me 70 degrees 250 meters away thanks honest now we're not going to make it lance i'm sorry definitely need smokes now johnny quagmix where's that tank yes uh taboo i use a controller without aim assistance and have zero complaints not fair enough i mean some people are just good you know without aim assist but you know the majority most people need it [Music] i keep playing with the same people here what's going on love that little like breathing sound i did all my builds in a video recently waffle [Music] um i'll show you what the ak-1 is afterwards when i pick it good shots he dropped me so quick there with that mp28 yeah lots of people do disable aims this is fine majority like 90 though we'll keep it on i reckon maybe even more than that 95. oh that one okay thank you for letting me know that that's a lot better hopefully they don't spot me there's bullets just coming out of the ground now what the hell is that about second i armed this though they're all going to come running here well it's just me so guess i'll die tried i'm gonna diffuse it now maybe not yeah it's the same thing as bf3 where if you diffusing it doesn't matter if the time has changed but me doing that has actually enabled them to get b which is good it pulled everyone off that point i'm happy with that [Music] 14 tickets our last chance really game assist doesn't work like in past games simply too many people there [Music] i instantly got revealed there by a sensor as well i feel like this game mode would be a lot better without the sensors you know just get rid of them someone could make a custom server where you couldn't pick them makes flanking really difficult is gg i'm here to help one ticket johnny's trying he's trying hard ah nice kill we are pulling out an rtb the enemy is one does it give you full amount of ammo when you switch ammo time yeah it does scott i told you to keep you get a full mag different types of ammo anyway but i'm not one to brag come on what's your game mode moment there's no incentive to use a suppressor yeah how long do they last they seem to last ages now i invited johnny there we go that sounds good suppressors are dead yeah low settings me all one low okay we didn't get past the first point last time on this but i was mainly just mucking about trying to grapple onto grenades and stuff you should give away a ps5 i don't have a ps5 to give away fernando you should give away a ps5 how about that that's that's the grip that i take warhol compensator nice oh my this okay has it crashed it's crashed again johnny we'll have to make the party again i'm sorry bear with me mark thank you for becoming a member it's very kind to you what's up muhammad hey hanley pierce i'll give away a ps6 dave yeah when do you think the playstation 6 is going to come out like 10 years which monitor hp and x27 if you do exclamation mark setup or exclamation mark specs you can see all my specs but it's changing next week i'll change jack can you say bottle of water there you go that's how all british speak people speak like bottle of water you should give away a ferrari okay so it's getting more expensive you should give away a house jack give away a house man come on i know you want to give away a house are you going to play the new warzone map when it comes out yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah jack it's matt's 33rd birthday what today matimo or matt from discord happy birthday matimo all map from discord to your best american accent well there's all sorts of different american accents isn't it giveaway spaceship yeah oh same map okay i'll get in touch with elon musk then anyway so i was i was showing you my ak build wasn't i and then the game crashed please don't do it again not like this this ui please okay we did it ready we did it no we did get we did get past this trip the village can't take the village charges no it's a standard mag i don't want that one standard issue johnny we're back here again whoa my game's lagging a lot uh sebastian thank you welcome to the members jack does all your equipment and vehicles and weaponry reset every day to default it resets usually after i played portal so i'll probably reset after this uh it's a bug there's a book unsurprisingly it's another bug man i could arrest you dude can you destroy those yeah you can actually just shoot the proc sensors you don't have to throw them back there's a guy right on the other side of this i don't care if i die whatever there's a wingsuit there they go one down okay there's a car there i didn't really say that how's the rush server what's up jake i don't really want to host one i'm just playing official i think if i host one it'll mess the xp up or something not sure johnny how is johnny doing jono is living the dream man he has a good life you know he's living the dream he's a great medic he's a great friend i like him a lot this one behind me not even gonna look it's an ostrich tactic gvt-4570 that's the mk2 isn't it okay play with acolyte he's probably playing with stoneman i'd imagine and we didn't take that point then okay he's still alive nobody killed that guy with the mk2 he was just ruining everyone from that position lever action yeah that's right what's up william b how's it going man johnny look best medic best medic on the battlefield living the dream no i nearly killed that casper i didn't realize it was two there good good i see lots of enemies dying good good good medic angel angel i know you can res me you literally angel just turn around please that squad mate could resume yellow please please guys i feel sad inside it's really sad like i would always go for a rest i don't care about like dying or whatever i mean i understand that there's a tactical advantage sometimes for not going for a res but i'd always try at least at least we got it god it looks rubbish on los angeles yeah it looks awful possible pillars mocking trouble you're up johnny you're up okay good [Music] i want to go to the roof it's nice blocked off can anyone res in this game so you can raise anyone in your squad no matter what specialist you play and angel and falc can raise anyone on their team don't have to be in their squad so mr smokes try this again is it this is important nathan yeah kyle thank you man look at all these that's the whole team there surely not clear not clear that was a an easter egg for uh alfred does anyone put a c4 on this no charge is set until they blow well it's just me again too late lads sorry [Music] look at that it's a floating bluetooth speaker that i just got stuck on what the hell what's up k-west no problem man thank you yeah you can redeploy whenever you want ron is voice chat coming i think so for yeah i think dice said they're working on it it should have been there at launch though for console on pc but it wasn't away from my position come on you got to plant that bee objective lads let's go i'm trying my hardest to be a distraction here i don't think i mean i i did take that objective by myself yeah johnny spawned in on me but they didn't realize i was too quick because i redeployed they were still just at that sand dune and i just flew over them all the team's got to push up though from the other direction we've got a nice born beacon here but if they don't push there's no point of us being here i'm here make sure that system is awful all right they've actually armed it the guy in here i can hear him is this as good as bf4 no it isn't well the f4 was a very different game when it came out to what it is today though return to the fight we're there's clear guy that's not mk2 guy isn't it dead yeah dead that's cool johnny my grenade lock on from here yeah that's so dumb [Music] too low wow that dude is uh doing work with that thing you know i've not i don't think i've even got a kill with it maybe once or twice i i've got to use it seems like it's good oh johnny oh damn it still says that the medic is incoming when they're dead so that needs to be fixed that sucks bro  target target lost there's a guy in here get back in the right in front fight him nice [Music] what the heck rich wow okay not really disconnected from the game there zombies so you're implying that the medic gets shot but they can still revive you when they're dead like a zombie is that what you're saying they could just reigns and then just get the defense out and do a zombie revive on you yellow you've done this to me before yellow to be fair there's a player here i don't think that could get me johnny and jack may be the best 2042 joe yeah johnny well he says good lad i always sing his praises every time you mention him looking looking dicey good joke uh mp28 nuts actually sorry the tree killed me i was killed by leaves i'm gonna wait for johnny you know i believe in in johnny

johnny for about 20 years now we're going to need a vector aren't we i think to clear this out or peepee maybe pp let's go problem with the vector is that i aim down the site and it scopes out oh damn

johnny is the unsung hero of 2042. is johnny a good chopper pilot he's not really into the vehicles to be honest chris um i think he could do it in a pinch you know if if it was if you really needed him and it was like johnny we need a pilot mate and you know will you do it it'll be like well okay you know no guarantee of success though you might end up in a lake somewhere that's just how it is sometimes there's a helicopter can i spawn on the roof found the target excuse me you could zip across couldn't they i think we could zip across back on bf4 and giving hell that lucy girl michael yeah both good games man i need to get back on hell let loose i've played it in a while what's up eddie ramirez i love your stuff being a fan for years thank you music all right i'm just full sending it whatever bad idea note yourself don't full send that guy killed me incredibly quickly though with that let me tell you we planted it your face is broken sundance there's a problem as the elevator is not going to call itself it's not based on motion here we go the f1 was fire yeah the f1 was a great game what is going on with my hand i've been ready for using it until they blow i think we've done it johnny johnny [Music] my hand is so broken like what is what is going on with that nice nice enjoy these moments when they come this is what i expected yo that skin is sick what the hell is that boris skin i'm just better than everyone else that's really cool he just got into a rush game with acolyte awesome davis yeah have fun aculite's a legend man great guy how's the new patch i mean lots of bugs i've crashed a few times uh performance on rush is really good though i'm enjoying rush you can actually feel the gun play a bit because you get more frames oh breakaway this is the first one we played in it we're attacking now shall use the score i'll try this car still no portal progression i think there is now dark scared my chat was saying that they've enabled it now rush mode's 32 players three-day planet what's the pros and cons of the vector crapload of recall at medium and long range short to medium range it destroys anyone johnny went beast mode he's obviously the end yeah johnny's always the mvp every day let's go let's go johnny i got rockets what the what is this put me in johnny johnny put me in johnny [Music] johnny johnny's not going to put me in um me i'm reloading line up hello [Music] ow i was successful [Music] charlie mike move up oh yeah what the are you still here nope chuck tester wow okay i switched targets because i thought guy was dead but he just had armor on you can't seem to do good with the scar this guy's sick one second i'm okay i'm okay let's move piss off oh johnny ah didn't get in quick enough is the grenade launcher any good on the scar the incendiary is pretty good the normal grenade isn't very good though the smoke grenade's kind of bugged as well it just produces like a pathetic powder smoke it's not really worth anything guys calamity of errors there what's up rambi tango how is this guy always getting into my games thank you yes everyone just kept falling over broken now might be time to put the uh keg k30 back on here i need the rate of fire close range let's do it nice born beacon here make sure they detonate [Music] [Music] get stoned immediately johnny that's what johnny's there for man you know yeah he's that type of guy johnny johnny's dead how long has it been since i last played daisy lock years so many years it's negative over i want to be able to fly around a bit jordy look to your right slashing looks here yes this is good i think people are learning how to play the game and actually like reviving now which is great that's what you use a vector for ow c5 how far did you throw that my friend wait that's a good throw she's got lipstick on yeah it kind of looks like it maybe odd stuff look at this legend oh they tried man that's it that's it that's it that's it yes guys we're living the dream he's getting stuck on everything how do i get in here i'm shh it's off [Music] i wish all might oh there's a bug if you use toggle ads with a vector you right click and it unsculpts you and it did it twice then in that firefight that's unacceptable that needs to be patched asap because a lot of people use toggle abs it's so frustrating please dice come on i hope that's on their list because it's so frustrating i don't know if it does it with any other gun it does it with pistols but it happens all the time with the vector excuse me what is there not like a there's not a roof entrance there any measure we're at half strength i'm just gonna hit fire i'm reloading then we got this there above on the roof can't get in can you no no no no [Applause] so many frags there why not just break the wall you know what i didn't know you could break the wall i assumed that you know because of the lack of destruction in this game that you couldn't do that was like see did it there as well something it's an evil sunday i got you is johnny a streamer no he isn't he's just my mate chris he's a he's an old friend oh attack interesting that this vector i picked up they're using the suppressor okay you just fell over and died thanks i guess uh that's why you take the vector right there i need health i'm dying shoot all the tangos nice what the what the slow door did you kill that guy oh no it's not reloaded this map's cool when you get to the end i like it a lot ah didn't only pre-fire me that's it it's over we've beaten them have you seen what dice wanted to do with orbital in the unreleased concept art the flood yeah yannick it's really cool i might do a video on that concept art because there's some really interesting stuff there i just learned there's two sprint modes in this game yeah there is it's tactical spin it's like modern warfare but there's no uh stamina so you can just do it infinitely what's my favorite sniper dxr i mean i've not used it since the patch so i tried the ntw earlier ntw is really good really slow rate father grim reaper fraggy will you take me to the dance tonight deep in the sticks yeah sure no no worries grim reaper just give me your um give me your deets and i'll come pick you up dave the squid modern warfare has two sprints yeah it's got normal sprint speed and tactical sprint i saw some of the concepts aren't for their specialists as well and they like a lot of them look a lot better i think than what they do in the game now concept art was sick it had much more like a gritty serious tone to it pbx why not i will colton yeah although my office is is uh it's just boring i'll show the new pc though for sure get control of the sectors and keep pushing the enemy back i didn't intend all the enemies to be there you know of course they're gonna be there oh too far away for the pbx there i need to get a lot closer it's bad okay man thank you for becoming a member you have downloaded the art book you get it with your edition no ollie i didn't know that um i just seen it on reddit people sharing pictures all around sir we need you hold on friendlies have taken out objective bravo [Music] do it there it unscoped me on the pbx friendlies have destroyed objective alpha sector is secure both objectives have been destroyed oh i'm a little early that works let's go johnny you're outside the combat area area secure advance to the next sector [Music] did you get that groove going with it explosives armed shoot eddie tango who gets nero damn what color is the like burn that's an old trick isn't it some youtubers do that they go they make like a message and they pin it on the chat they go is the like button black or white and then it just gets people to click the like button because they're like oh i can't remember just a trick indian papi come on i'll wait for you get the kill get the rest come on come on you got five seconds four three indian papi please i believe in you when is battlefield going to be an esports game like cs go league of legends never fadi battlefield's never going to be an esports game i feel like if i don't try i can't i can't leave the vehicle there we go rest in peace indian puppy i'm just ruining your frank [Music] i mean battlefield has had competitive scenes in the past but they just they never go anywhere i played like i played competitive bf3 and bf4 i do think it can be a good competitive game but the audience just isn't there for it like battlefield's a casual arcade game i've tried in the past to do 5v5 stuff um but if you do 5v5 and you want to be a big esport you've got to be better than cs or valorum and i just don't i don't see battlefield ever doing that 8v8 can be interesting with vehicles friendlies have destroyed objective alpha um dyson ear have never really supported it though that's the problem like i remember back in bf3 like before the game released they had like virgin media and richard branson going oh we're gonna do a tournament and the prize money is like six million dollars or whatever it was and it's gonna be on a a battleship it's never happened just literally never happened seems like it's just on the smg's that that happens when you radius [Applause] i'd love battlefield to have a competitive scene because i think it could be really interesting but i think you know you've got to come up with a formula that's interesting [Applause] i mean they tried it with incursions but it just wasn't very good again no i didn't really get much support so i don't think they've ever had a proper go at it i don't i mean i don't think they did support it narco i don't think they really did and not many people played incursions though because it wasn't very good so like the game the game mode itself was just a bit in there i think like from my experience like the best competitive battlefield that i've played was like bf3 conquest small like some of those maps and layouts were actually really good i enjoyed playing them conquest small could work domination is just a bit too boring to watch like they had like esl finals and stuff with bf4 with domination but it's not it's just not that interesting a game mode to watch because it's hard to follow the action and you don't get those clutch moments you get in a game like cs or valorum you can occasionally but it's really hard to follow especially as a spectator bf3 conquest more was actually a good competitive game mode because of the map design i really enjoyed it your team is just running through this map yeah yeah i think the problem that battlefield has as a competitive game is that like i just said like the fundamentally battlefield is an arcade casual game with 64 players 128 players that in itself doesn't lend itself well to competitive games and also one of the key identities of battlefield is vehicles so just hold on you know people might be like well if we have a competitive mode it has to have vehicles in otherwise it's not battlefield and again that goes back to the world if it doesn't have vehicles and it's just 5v5 you need to make something that's better than you know the competition that's better than cs i don't think it can be done also it's really difficult to balance vehicles and infantry in a competitive setting i'm not saying it can't be done it's just like it's really tricky that's all and there's some really passionate members of the community you know that um battlefield competitive has and some great casters as well like bretfx like i don't know if you know who he is he was always very good at it solid effort but it's kind of just all fizzled out now you know i told you to keep up i don't think we'll see it for a long time if if ever again enjoy these moments when they come hard work pays off sometimes [Music] and they can't like imagine imagine having a uh 32 v32 land tournament the amount of people you would have to bring the amount of pcs you'd have to set up the amount of problems you'd have it's just not it's not feasible to do it with that many players so it's got to be it's got to be smaller scale like 8v8 5v5 in my opinion competitive rush could be interesting yeah but yeah bf3 i think that was the most fun competitive for me that's the first time you've heard a line from rao yeah people don't really play around that much there's a lot of communities as well in battlefield that like they organize competitive events like they will you know say okay right on this night we're gonna get this platoon or this clan to play against this clan and and they all get on the server and do it and they spectate and they stream it it's just there's not this it's really small really really small minority so it doesn't get that much traction so try sniping um i might try the dxr seeing as uh everyone's telling me that it's been changed so it's broken or something it's rush ranked apparently it is now yeah push the enemy back sector by sector and destroy the objectives what did they change on it scope or something maybe don't know this i'm going to rest johnny now oh nice shot if jack helped you off a tank would you what does that mean bf has ranked modes no it doesn't mr k not this battlefield try shooting shot after shot it's broken okay i'll see if i can replicate what you mean oh yeah the animation's busted now control the objectives good job i'm gonna play down light too yeah yeah definitely use lmg next game i'll tell you what sniping with good fps is nice as well those are there with the shell head there [Music] nice still good man it's still good right there for my marker i don't think so dlss only works for me at 4k really 1440p doesn't do anything i couldn't i thought i'd be able to wingsu then target dude that thing has so much hp don't watch football not really zade i watch like champions league and world cup that's about it sometimes match the day can you use the ntw 50. i used it earlier i'm checking out the dxr because people said it have changed but it seems uh it's definitely something broken with the animation but the gun itself seems uh pretty decent still [Applause] i'm not noticing anything different with the bullet velocity a little bit [Music] it was very alpha though when i charlie mike played up these turrets no you revived that player i want that kill oh glock burst fire is pretty cool yeah it is although the sounds really messed up with it in this battlefield you have auto healing yeah you do himalayan have i tried the game on console i tried it at day one of early access on the series x and i just played like the classic portal maps really and that's it got it johnny johnny i can't res you sorry oh god it keeps doing it man so annoying special how did that sundance not die then what the hell that was weird pokeball nice objective noise it's too low ah i thought it was a friendly blue dot behind him what's up infamous your biggest fan thank you man hey simon b how you doing man ali bond ali what's up man did you enjoy stockholm johnny won't be here for you forever i'll start for that's really sad but it's true that's why it's sad how many players 32 bento 32 players oh where are we oh my god i'm dead i'm dead missed the money shot an assault rifle now admit you want all the previous beer three and four maps in portal uh mike it would be great if they had a way to just port them and put them in yeah like sure why not oh billy thank you fair blow detox going ham angel turn around and go make sure they're dead and go dead what's up catherine how you doing man first time watching the stream thanks can i just throw grenades down here that's fine sorry are they what was going on with that foul oh they were coming at the repel i was a bit confused there they was going on are they still over here [Music] that's a cheeky spot isn't it okay i'm good i can hear him defusing it no dead what are you do i mean that guy could have easily diffused that i think that's good i enjoyed that enemy forces are in retreat excellent job i mean i'm i'm actually really liking this rush like it just feels like a cohesive experience you know like i can actually focus and make tactics and stuff and play with my teams conquest and breakthrough just seem so sporadic and random sometimes and there's so many vehicles that you can't really get in a groove it's nice this is a nice change of pace see you later johnny love you they've never updated the m-com sound asphalt i think they've done it on purpose for the nostalgia i prefer it you know i'd rather they didn't update the m-com sound i like it it's the classic bad company too nothing wrong with that i think more tickets would be good yeah oh discarded have i played this yet i don't think i've played this yet shot can only rush that'd be mad yeah pbx doesn't have any recoil at all it's not real gabrielle there's no recall on some of the guns man very easy to control it on pc 32 players euro love you johnny is johnny in the stream johnny are you here um mo show thank you for becoming a member a phantom as well thank you very much um i'll whack out the ac i think with a range maybe i've not done a c4 gpa in this game

[Applause] got beamed the batman he is a bit batman isn't it to be honest when you think about it the wingsuit i don't think i would enjoy the game um as much as i do if it didn't have the wingsuit i feel like the wingsuit is a big um boost of fun you know that the game doesn't have let's go come on let me out rest nice wow that's a mckay am i going to try the new fortnight now pablo i don't not really not interested in that game who gets nero i just can't keep up with the building you know like just crazy it's too sway if it was just the game without the building i'd probably play it but then it wouldn't be fortnite would it so there you go i like a lot of the mechanics in that game but the building is just um just insane craig do you have to be a member to join discord yeah you do craig um you either become a member on youtube or you can become a twitch sub stay back anyone know any good ways to level up daddy big mac do you mean xp or do you mean weapons if you want to level

down cool okay it's fixed yay are you talking about xp just play conquest be a team player pack flags get revives get some kills the good stuff i think this is the most satisfying weapon in the game definitely out of the assault rifles what's up with the plastic bags floating around i don't know maybe they've done it to add a bit of ambience and it's not really worked not sure oh my god i'm gonna get grinded the true beta experience i'm just getting grinded into a pulp by this thing pain how you doing joe what is rush two m comes one team attacks one team defends pretty good oh what a great spawn i don't understand that right okay there's something wrong with that vehicle that mav that's the second time tonight where i've been killed inside it and it hasn't exploded the vehicle so the passengers are taking damage when they shouldn't hopefully um guys are aware of that because that sucks hey chris yeah i'm good thanks plastic bag ambience frags doesn't really roll off the tongue does it i mean the m-com is actually isn't it on this side please got the guy the queues and i think no there was another one on the right damn it score is surprisingly good yeah the score is great great weapon any medics screw that latvia man bye [Music] oh dude just ate that rocket yeah i need a chucky milk shirt i'm sure you can buy that online somewhere chill vibes surely that was a slug to

yeah it does tom our charges have been disabled yes it does who gets nero how would you spell that laugh you gotta have an h in there somewhere sure prefer ultra wide or triple screen triple i can't focus ultrawide is really cool for racing games and third person rpgs but the first person shooter is it's difficult to focus because there's too much in information in your peripheral vision why is this hmm can i get one of those invisible chairs is that like a perk that angel has angel here living the dream definitely seen some stuff but don't worry sometimes it just works out that way you keep doing you buddy strength hmm i can hear a lot of enemies a dirty little gap there you're dead you're dead you're dead don't understand your hope and your passion is gone friendly down [Music] i'll do it myself [Music] what the hell blow up already blow up dammit what the game is falling apart what is going on it's a glitch in the matrix remember that tick tock mean from a couple years is no hit markers and i've got a kill what is have this game man like please i'm having fun but it's just like lacking a severe level of polish man shoot any tango who gets nero there are so many bugs that just fight against you [Applause] okay hey i'll leave with someone the quicksilver scene from x-men yeah it was a bit like that special no lock on to the one right there oh my god what's up tomahawk yeah rush is fun man like this as i said earlier this actually feels like uh a well put together experience in terms of the game mode the game itself is still falling apart but the game mode i've had a blast playing this game mode sometimes ow damn it what's my favorite film of all time i don't have one i have lots of like ones that i like i couldn't pick one oh my god dude this gun is so sick well bloomer load there didn't i family look at jack grew up on daisy and now wants polish games yeah daisy was the worst man but i had so much fun in that game like when it came out there's nothing like

let's go grizzle oh my god did my grenades not do anything then is there a weapon that i struggle with in this game not really though i mean i haven't really used the mk2 yeah bitters please isn't it i said tank please i told you to keep that danke thank you a good day's work but i'm not one to brag yes everything as i expected that that's cool proper sundance mod those is jack hi la mao i'm high on bugs right now oh well kick w kick w if i played insurgency yeah i used to play in the mod back in the day like on half-life and i played the one on source and i played samsung renewal i've not played this yet on rush i think this is last one i haven't played no i did play it damn it we just okay so brain stupid the ones where we don't push past the first point my brain just goes now i didn't play mate sorry that map nah didn't happen this game remembers me the last medal of honor what like warfighter you mean liam i'm so tired tonight get get yourself an early night liam yeah just go chill out for a bit go relax you know get yourself in bed have an early night why not treat yourself bugs not drugs what should we use try the um these shotguns nuts by the way let me show you should any tango who gets nero thinking is hard man why did i just fly reloading make sure they detonate i need meds just came up and punched me in the face how is my mental health statement we've taken out objective alpha and the less we say about at the beginning this cannon is just absolutely trash i don't get it like the machine gun's actually better than the cannon i think it's like an anti-vehicle thing this is what we want this is it oh god dare i cross there though i mean i'm dead if i do that gonna defuse it he's gonna defuse it lockers thank you for becoming a member kanye don't let people know about the 12m auto listen people already know it's too late oh yeah [Music] advance to the next sector [Music] sweet enemies yes sir make sure they detonate yes sir it's too slow look you can just wingsuit straight to the mcom before they even get here i mean no scanning for you fake thank you i don't think it should be that good well do would you agree with me chat like the range that you can kill people at this should it be that good len thank you for becoming a member i like your your icon that's a cool profile picture the arming times a lot quicker than you remember yeah yeah quite fast in this a wing suit off this no not not high enough above the ground that one unfortunately i'll see if i can get you guys some better examples i mean i think like shotguns should be pretty decent like uh you know in that close in between like close range obviously yeah you want to shock them to just these people but they shouldn't be completely pathetic like close to medium range you know in that 75 bracket oh i see okay that was actually a decent use of the shield there yes i think it's um i think it's in a good place personally i don't mind it it's just when you get that drum mag you can really go to town which is kind of cool i don't think it's like super overpowered or anything like that i need somewhere high to jump off so i can get in here this will be the perfect time for the 12m as well sensibles everywhere what kind of pokemon are you how do you do the things you do you can glide to the i think maybe they have to be placed a little bit further apart andreas because you can get there so quick wait angel you can res me nope don't want to okay charlie mike move up got three seconds cody try what's up brainy how are you doing yeah i've tried it off it's decent you're getting underneath here can't you little little entrance here perfect for shotguns look at this in the new call of duty you could be the dog have you ever wanted to be the dog now you can i'm dead if i run for this no it's fine there's no one here it's fine it's fine come up the stairs my friends come to see mr jack with the shotgun no problem for you no problem five shots that iris just just like you see that it's like breakdancing or something and then just it's so weird i think that's a controller player uh jboy thank you for subbing man thank you for becoming a member yeah it's a really good route that is good to know disappointed with level destruction yeah dalton yeah i expected a lot more to be honest [Music] i wonder if they'll improve it over time does the pellet spread narrow if you crouch yeah it does pull battlefield's been like that for ages uh i spawn here see you later zane thank you for watching have fun at work appreciate you being here on the roof die to the battlefield then someone's sniping me there something going on over there is it applying some kind of suppression to them when i hit them ah dude i didn't know the angle our bigger brush lobbies 32 ppp penguin death yeah you can use it like that you have to make that sound as well if you don't make the sound it doesn't work in the game it doesn't ping oh you're kidding i just went the first rocket just went through it man this is the full bravo team insertion here robo6 going dark i need to go upstairs dance let's go 13 tickets this is it of course there's a sensible right there i should have expected it i should have expected that to be 28 sensible there would be good to get a rest here wouldn't it no i really wanted to be there for that attack our charges have been disabled by [Music] i told you to keep up hard work pays off sometimes yes it does wow don't be sad don't be dead i just tell you right okay i'm gonna play one round of studies game mode because i promised i would at the start but that's a solid three hours and 40 minutes of rush on paul right there uh gamer's great love the game mode um still lots of uh bugs with the game you know hold back here uh enjoyment at times i appreciate the fact that you actually get good frames though as well i get good frames on rush less players smaller maps you can get into the gunplay a bit more you know feel it a bit better oh my god so many things snipers knives let's go don't be sad sometimes so you get two bullets and a knife every time you get a kill you get a bullet back i think that's how it works i feel like this round's already started draw good game guys thanks for playing great game mode start loved it 10 out of 10. zero xp on feels bad man hourglass okay i sound like a sims character they speak backwards don't they is big sim singlish do i think we'll get classes back i think maybe to a certain degree cold blood i think they'll split the specialists into calgary's have i been eating donuts no i haven't had any donuts today i had a new york chicken with french fries corn on the cob onion ring coleslaw on the side and then a rolo cookie dough dessert okay here we go two bullets you all play as casper i don't see any enemies i don't see any prunes either where are they got any cat food there that's yo i want that air conditioning that's stealthy oh someone here okay use two shots but because i've got the kill i've got two shots back oh no gotta get a headshot fail let's go let's go let's go let's go 1v1 crazy chris thank you for the 10 months one it's funny because i know like this is so funny it just shows like the the cultural divide so in the like most people in the uk would know what a new york chicken was but i have a lot of american people that watch me and obviously americans don't call it a new york chicken oh that's quite funny where's there's a guy over here somewhere where did you go don't be sad sometimes it just works out this way i went for the no scope messed up you got it you know you missed 99 of the 100 of the shots that you don't take 100 of the time what's a new york chicken okay so if you go to like a restaurant or a pub in the uk you order a new york chicken um it's a chicken breast with bacon on top and then uh cheese like melted on the top and then usually you have it with like french fries or uh coleslaw onion rings corn on the cob that kind of thing intron yeah i properly with that one didn't i i'm not very good at this game but am i i'm losing are the chickens actually from new york um no don't know nice i missed again how have i lost that fight i don't understand that it's also called hunter's chicken that's another word for it sometimes they put like barbecue sauce on it we can we can make a
