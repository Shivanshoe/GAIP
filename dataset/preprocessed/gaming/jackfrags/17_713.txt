so yesterday I was playing some war zone with a couple of friends and in full player squads the new mode the new table is different loot that you find on the floor the stuff that you get in these supply crates it's all new and it's changed from what you've been used to in season 2 and at the start of this match here I found this just in a regular blue crate a gold legendary weapon called the dying light now what's interesting about this is the in-game here it's classed as an assault rifle but as you can see when I pick it up I'm pretty sure that this is the holger 26 which is usually an LMG is a bit weird but I picked it up and I used it the entire round and it really surprised me it's just devastatingly good in war zone I don't know if they've changed any of the specs of it for this particular blueprint if you happen to find it but it's a monster primary weapon and it's inspired me to level up my own holger and see if I can copy this build but with that said I've got two great games for you guys to watch today playing with the two angry gamers and Johnny the first section is absolutely bonkers I don't know how we made our life but I think you'll enjoy this with that said if you do enjoy the video leave a like and subscribe to see more let's do this right brother sit oh my god dead straight away there's nothing on back there on the left that's the mule with a spinning
