i can't believe i have to say this but here we go i'm saying it anyway a couple days ago i posted a video on the new mind male addiction skin in warzone it's a really unique looking skin with a cool inspect animation and i thought it would make for a good video to use this gun in a solo match and see if we could get a win with it so i posted that video as a really fun game unfortunately we didn't get the win but i did see a few comments from people wondering how i knew people were in certain locations during that match so the way i play solos is i like to get uavs spam them attack people and just move around i can't camp in a building it just balls the hell out of me so i don't do it and there was one clip in particular a lot of people commented on where they were like how did you know that guy was exactly where he was some people actually accused me of cheating as well but all it is is simple knowledge of how the minimap works and before you say oh everyone knows this these are real comments people left these comments so i thought that i'd explain how the minimap works in cod warzone so if you didn't know maybe you could take this information use it yourself and bring that into a game of warzone and take advantage of it here's one of the clips from the video i know exactly where this guy is in the house based on the uav so you can see the dot on the mini map i approached the house and i've got my mouse ready i know this guy is in that window even though i can't see them based on the mini map so i prefer get the headshot that's an easy kill and a lot of these comments thought that was a bit suspicious so let me explain how i knew that guy was there in warzone and in other call of duty games in the past when you've got a uav up if an enemy player is on the uav and they're on the same level as you they appear as just the red dot on the mini-map if they're above you they appear as a red dot with an up arrow or a chevron on top of the dot if they're below you they appear as a red dot with a chevron pointing downwards below the red dot so with that information when i'm pushing this house i know that this guy's on the same level as me i know the layout of that building the only place they can be is in that window so i just thought i'd explain that because even though to a lot of us that is common knowledge i guess some people just don't know it it never really tells you in warzone or modern warfare how the mini map works you might be a new player who's never played cod before and you just didn't have that information but there it is if you didn't know it now you do and you can use it to your advantage now then moving on today i've got an old video for you we're using the reactive all skin here it's a beast of a weapon again solo match so you'll get live commentary from me and all the drama that comes along with a sweaty solo game of war zone but a bit of a twist today asus got in touch with me and they wanted to do a sponsored video on one of their new brand spanking new gaming laptops and they sent over this bad boy the rog strix scar 17. at the time of making this video the components in this laptop are top spec and we'll be playing warzone on this today and i thought for a bit of a change we'll play on high graphics to really push the performance of this and you can see the frame rate in the top left if you want to check it out under the hood here we've got a ryzen 9 5 900 hx cpu so that's amd's zen 3 architecture eight cores and it can turbo up to 4.6 gigahertz and i was seeing that kind of speed in the armory software where you can change all the profiles if you want more of an aggressive fan profile you can add that if you want it to be quieter when you're gaming you can add that too so all in all it's an absolute monster of a cpu as for the gpu in here we've got an rtx 3080 laptop gpu so this is nvidia's latest ampere technology and you've got all of the brilliant features that come with the nvidia software suite like dlss the nvent codec for recording and streaming which i use all the time real-time ray tracing for some snazzy reflections some max q features in here too like dynamic boost 2.0 and resizable bar which increase your game performance by optimizing the power going to the components and giving the cpu access to all of the gpu memory and also nvidia reflex which can help reduce input latency on your system and just make it feel a lot more responsive that brings us nicely onto the screen of this laptop which is a 1080p ips panel at 360 hertz it's incredibly smooth great to play fps games on and you tie that with higher frame rates and you just have a nice responsive gaming experience it's also got one of the best keyboards i've ever used on a laptop and that's because these are optical mechanical switches so they feel a lot more similar to your typical mechanical keyboard rather than that mushy feel that you can sometimes get on laptop keyboards all sorts of rgb on there to dolby atmos sound and it's using a liquid metal compound on the cpu for improved calling which i found kind of interesting i've never really heard of that before sounds cool apparently it's very efficient at keeping the temperatures low if you're interested in checking out the laptop for yourself there's a link down in the description below and a big thanks again to asus for sponsoring this one and letting me have a play with it with that said let's get into the game if you enjoy it guys leave a like it's a great way to help support me let's see if we can get a win okay just to show you guys we're playing at 1080p and uh most settings are on high so it should look pretty good i haven't even looked at the map the frame rate's in the top left by the way if you want to see it tv let's go down there why not i think it's going to be quite a hot drop with this line of the plane here few people above me let's have a look i don't see any boxes i do see a gun here you just got an ffa i'm done i'm out there mate yeah you can have the roof it's fine i don't want anything to do with that i really want a normal plate though look at that what we're gonna do is ask ow that's rude oh there's someone in here on the roof [Applause] and there's one still on the roof of uh you've got an algae all right did you ever go cracks just kept peeking for some reason that was weird and there's my 10k you reckon this guy's coming to the bye let's see no they're not going anywhere it's not worth a shot is it i'm a lowly first instead of your wife okay here we go reactivation give me that it's cool a skin coming back [Music] i'm dipping i think if i run around here i'll have an angle friendly loadout drop on the way get to them before they sell press king got the monitor yep that was close man he's a decent player i think like he expected me to flank as well the owl just uh [Applause] dominated it man look at that it's already changed a bit with a bit of damage it's kind of glowing that's cool dude right here and a little fine aren't they missed a couple bursts there he was looking down here he said exactly the same thing because what i do any gear for me i kind of want some cash so i can get you over here you coming over here moving yeah i think so fuel come on look at that it's just dirty absolute dirt going to truck as well just keep putting damage on it anyway i should buy a self-rest before i uh get sniped in the head i really like their keyboard on this uh laptop though it's nice the screen as well i mean i don't know that many games that you could get 360 fps to make the most of it but maybe something like valerian or cs and maybe i should try jailbreak all prisoners are being released from the gulag jailbreak you don't have to get that in solos you see how many come back heads up combatants are redeployed 37 one one person i guess it's because when you play solos you just like as soon as you die you just leave and queue up don't you that's that's solos what's the point sticking around right i think i saw at the corner of my eye there though something here isn't there wrong place wrong time oh that's funny i don't know where this guy is no i'm backing off there oh that's bad timing mate that is a really bad timing look at it now though what even is that on it almost looks like a downtown area doesn't it that's super cool okay all right we've got to get to the other side of the stadium there's always rats in this door now isn't it look at it in the dark man that's sick this ffar as well another cool scene those actually bounce right towards me oh man like these buildings are going to be really strong position there's probably already people there should we chill here for a second see if we spot anyone or hear anyone losing ground no one down here is there contact there is is that guy just afk okay just a random afk dude that's strange maybe they thought they were safe there but apparently not i'm glad that i looked there it's the easiest kill i've ever got in my life afk maybe run to the door trying to make a cup of tea mid game you never know is that trucking i think that truck might be the left keep the pressure on okay so someone just got beamed from there that guy died and was killed by someone there i think i'm gonna go now get down early enemy uav overhead gas is moving wait here someone fighting right in front of me then is it worth trying to finish that i don't know i'm going in [Applause] there's one down at the back as well [Applause] uh ah good [ __ ] fair play one more [Applause] okay okay i mean that's just made a lot of noise right there they're wearing the same skin as well weren't there got gas inbound safe zone relocated [Applause] this is such a bad position isn't it just i just kind of feel like i'm holed up in here gotta hear footsteps then maybe that truck comes in here i'm gonna absolutely destroy him come on come on come on come on come on i promise it's clear in here there's nobody around is that someone firing at the truck just gotta keep putting damage on it man contact that was a guy firing him i think oh my god two others left my heart is pounding right now my heart is pounding are they firing okay 1v1 sounded like an ffar to be honest for a mac 10. come to me come to me are you serious dude no no no i didn't have a chance he must have known where i was fair play and that's the m16 that was a great game anyway i think we're gonna post that that's good fun the zone just screwed me just bounced in completely the wrong direction i didn't see that dude well played how much damage did we put out 3800 not bad at all well there we go guys sad times unfortunately couldn't win that one second place i'll take it i'd like to keep you guys guessing anyway i did actually check valrant on the laptop too and downloaded it and i was just in the practice range here and you can see the fps there pretty good like 350 360. and i had it running on medium settings so medium 1080p that kind of vibe i didn't get to play a game of element on it yet because i got to edit the video put it out there whatever but really nice performance thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed this one once again a massive thanks to asus for letting me use that laptop beast of a machine loved it kind of upset i've got to send it back but it is what it is and again if you want to check it out for yourself link is down below i hope you enjoy the rest of your day guys subscribe for more i'll see you next [Music] time
