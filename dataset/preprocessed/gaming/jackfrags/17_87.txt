hi guys and welcome to tiny tina's wonderlands today you're going to be playing through the start of the game with tomographic and study over there if you enjoy the stream of the video do consider leaving a like and if you're new also consider subscribing thank you for coming along here so this is a spin-off i suppose to borderlands it is made by gearbox software and apparently it's a successor to a couple of other tiny tina's borderlands games that have released in the past which i think were called tiny tina's assault and dragon keep and we thought that this would be a good laugh today jumping into it always good fun with stodd and tommo i don't know what stud's doing back there he's just jumping around like an absolute mad lad also i have to say a big thanks to epic games for sponsoring this one today this game is available on the epic game store and it's a link down in the description below and also in the chat i do have a few codes to give away as well so big thanks to them and if you pick this game or any other up on the epic game store do consider using my create code jack frags and i will get a bit of kickback from that so without further ado i think the boys might be ready to start and i think this is kind of like uh dungeons and dragons fantasy world but there's guns it's borderlands you could say you know maybe it's like borderlands 3.5 or borderlands 4 in anything but name but there's a lot more fantasy elements i know it's got a really good score on metacritic as well i think it's an 80 at the moment so i'm expecting to have a laugh and i appreciate all you guys being here today let's do this study hello it's time over here um oh he's moving he's he's just moving he's crouching up and down and that means he's alive i think he's alive or his cat is on his keyboard well there are some green boxes over here starter you see this did i not already oh no i did see the other ones that's the classic you know borderlands green light to tell you that there's loot in it yeah if it's not green then it's mean yeah it's useless and you might as well not go near it that's what they say in the borders yeah as avid borderlands fans that's true i did take all the other loot because um that's just me there was more loot was there yeah can you mark any ping i don't think you can ping actually huh there's some did you open these boxes here yeah i open that there's some there's more over there at the next house as well stud i found the emotes yeah you well how did you do that i just hold zed and then hello my friends hello graphic how do

tom that accent please well on your quest to defeat the dragon lord it's wise to explore everywhere you can you'll need experience and powerful gear to take on the tougher challenges ahead you might find your path blocked along the way but there are friends to be made in the wonderlands who can aid you on your journey very good can i throw myself of a cliff in this game why is your obsession with jumping up cliffs oh god what is this me in real life look there's a way there's a secret here but we have to go look at start's character he's got carriers oh my god [Music] wait can we have it how do we get that that's so annoying no apparently you gotta go through this is like uh you know like in the mario games where you have like a little area between worlds it's basically what that is yeah it's the d a tabletop encounter it's a green goblin what's hiding in the tall grass be careful of enemies in the other world touching them will start combat and count defeating your enemy cows will earn you xp we're gonna have to roll some dice come on are we fighting in first person now i want i guess okay yeah this gun is sick it just freezes interesting concept oh yeah cars like discs bye you

ultimate ability it's a semi-auto like cosplay mine's just got goop that's a laser beam oh there's a big sniper let me get lovely love that all right let's go that's the one that i was just using it wasn't very good but maybe that's because i don't have much decks um is it because the accuracy is like one percent could do with being better okay don't go in the long grass avoid the pokemons you immediately oh you're about to order right now i'm scared of it what's this there's an invisible thing here i collected that already oh okay uh he's coming for you no no no no no no no he's still

my dragon he's called belle and you can think of the second name i can't believe i don't get a mushroom it's called magic mike i want my own mushroom rather control well you should have chosen a better character russians through the character creation huh tom we spent 25 minutes on the character chris i spent 25 characters a minute but you you got stuck waiting for me you spent two i spent 25. we are not the same did it explain that you would have a companion who was a dragon yes it shows you the companion flying over your head or beside you so i literally don't get one then ever wow

technology yeah that's body but it was running crazy how they do that these days how do they manage it man likes just like the uncanny valley is not around anymore really isn't it just think about it what do you think about this if you think about technology oh the door just blew open what's in here moving around oh it's the bonner boss i've entered their chambers i've killed them immediately really you know that wasn't even the final boss was just a random name it was marked for some reason [Music] we're finishing this game today welcome to our 27 hour playthrough it's actually like 40 50. rated by willamette stud your mushroom's got some cheeks on them have you seen it have you seen the cheeks oh my god i'm just saying i'm just nervous someone's been cooking did you say that mushroom busting [Laughter] i mean they should probably cover that up we got some cakes on him [Applause] the hell just happened there just blew up the unicorn did a nuke i think yeah if you get 20 kills then you corn doesn't mean clip clap clip clap clip crop i'm gonna have that whatever that is oh but stallion just said nay guys subtitles just informed me of that this is gonna be a boss right this seems like a boss area and read the fate makers created allowed read something aloud any points available there's a party there i messed up i threw that down oh is that why i unlocked it's uh i think what do we do oh my god i can throw my hammer like thor now no what where are you get how are you able to do this at the top you can see where it tells you your character is like the two things you can go into one either tree the top two select your actual probability oh my god yeah first two where is that in skills going skills the first two tiles are the ability itself you can change it oh damn oh that's the one that you have tom i think right terrell surge no because we've got the front ability please okay we'll try that each class is so you've got like is that you that's my hurricane no way oh it's my this is my um throwing hammer uh missed it this one and then i press g again it comes back to me you thought that i am thought it's kind of cool and my new f does this oh my god we have to find the tone of fate yeah so here's why this thing follows me around how do i put the bubble down again the spiders it's spiders then that's a nice freezer belay there that one gun cray and a secret i don't know what this is a giant egg a giant egg half that spider that did massive damage and it's bleeding and it's dead i am thor son of odin that ability is so sick man [Music] is that a long range i missed yeah if i miss on the first throw then obviously pull it back and it kills them on the way back there's the thing there okay how do i ping again the hell was that something just ran past at the end of the hallway now it was a ghostly figure the game the character went what was that it went to the right you go first there's nothing here tom you're seeing things you're going crazy another weapons crate the guys it was a ghostly figure you've gone crazy oh my god hold on jack you're gonna have to read it my old nemesis my old nemesis [Music] can you name your companion that's what you can't you also be called the cake chicken [Laughter] fate brings us together that's going on my vision board do you really believe that oh my god sly counsel but i guess you know they brought us together yes it did i don't like this thing that just follows me on the ground like how did i even get this god traps you did that oh you stepped down no you stepped on his side i jumped over it hey jack if you step here basically all right okay okay it's good to know that yeah it's good to know that this yeah doing quite a lot of damage to jack oh there's one there's an axe if you stand here guys and just take the full force of the axe in the face actually doesn't do any damage whatsoever is drop something what's that who's the what's this what's this electro crate is it okay wow my spell's the same now electrocrate i'm still cursed with the following wine i runes son of odin wait look at my ability look at this okay are you getting ready hannah there was something up here that i missed oh a sexy blade is that what it's called yeah that's what i've called it anyway there's a little corridor here where it's just got some dyes in it oh yeah well that's good where is it how'd you go [Music] oh wow oh wow oh man well i can order all right look at my buffs and stuff like that just forget so that that's making me have a random rune thing the following the shotgun there i simply don't understand i'm simply blown away [Music] that's nice this is this is a pistol with a taser [Music] highly effective versus armor [Music] oh i can buy a legendary thing i just jumped over that trap like it was nothing it didn't damage me what is that well mine now [Music] how many guns are in this game there's so many unlimited what do you mean because they're all um randomly generated all right so you get like everything looks different money hey a lot of that stuff i can't purchase oh you're gonna have not enough money we'll have the money here just there's the left of it i've got something for the berserker what is it that i think it's like what it's a thing i'll drop it for you maybe we invent peaceful maybe that's the problem what do we have here donkey [Music] so this is [Music] you drop it son it's behind you somewhere order regeneration right area damage sell sell so sell spells i've already got purple in there though what's this do then versus my axe 36 damage and this one does hardly be spoiled so no okay let's buy that uh there may be a boss in here guys and i may have dropped down um yeah there there is the boss just started the bus oh my god he stuck me in oh god it sucked him has anyone got um what's it called poison no yes i'm i'm acidic i might do actually he's being acidic he's dead all the acid levels gone anyway [Music] no [Music] i

a swampy musk a newborn baby smell he's not a baby though is he's like 1500 years old yeah but like is he actually yeah he's old yeah but regardless of that i just feel like his species probably emits a pheromone of uh baby baby okay yeah but is a newborn baby smell from like talcum powder and like the stuff that you put on the baby yeah but it just smells of it so naturally he emits what i mean is actual like newborn baby like the baby's just popped out he smells of that that's right inside inside then yeah is this cannon yeah i'll message george get george on the phone see what see what he thinks i've got my speed though g lucas what does chewbacca smell like wet dog yeah i also understand this will be the fertilizer she's going to use the loin cloth as fertilizer well all of the smelly
