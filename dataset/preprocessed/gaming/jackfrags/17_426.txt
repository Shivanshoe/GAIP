i can't believe i'm saying this but there is a burst rifle in warzone that doesn't suck the m16 they've changed a couple things on it recently with the barrels and the grips you can do stuff like this beautiful so the m16 came to war zone when cold war arrived and i just wrote it off to be honest i was like nah burst rifles just suck in war zone and typically speaking they aren't very good they're just not that versatile there's always a better option you can only pick two guns at the end of the day but last few days i've seen an uptick in people using this and i watched a video by a guy called true game data who also has a fantastic website kind of like how synthetic used to be for battlefield where you can compare weapon attachments and look at gun stats and everything like that and he also has a youtube channel where he goes into great detail about weapon stats attachments which one's the best which ones to use for certain situations whatever and he put out a video on the m16 like the buffed m16 i should say about a week ago and there was a more recent one where he goes over some stealth changes great youtube channel by the way i'll link it down in the description below if you want to go check him out if you're really into stats and attachments and everything trying to optimize your warzone experience he's one of the people that i think you can really trust in that space so i thought you know what give it a shot so i leveled it up a bit in cold war luke town 24 7. uh if you don't have cold war you can go into plunder and do supply runs with the helicopter it's really quick way of leveling up your guns especially if you've got double xp talking with double xp's on at the time maxed it out this is the build here this one definitely felt best and there's already a meta building around this loadout so i would say for now if you want to try this max it out use these specific attachments and you'll have a good time with it a couple of caveats it does have a bit of a learning curve to it i have to admit i thought um you know i'd be better off with a an amax here or be better off with an m4 or something but what this gun has got going for it is the ttk very quick and also the recoil the recoil is almost perfectly vertical and whether you're on a controller or a mouse you should know that's quite easy to control some pc you get used to burst timings when you can click when you can fire again and you just just pull down on your mouse straight down and you can put those three bullets almost in the same spot even at long distances like this still works just pull down a little bit as you click the lead time takes a bit of getting used to as well and knowing how far to aim in front of someone based on the distance at longer distances it gets a bit wishy-washy it's a good way to put another thing and if you've got a sniper maybe switch to that but i was running this with smg i was running it with an mp5 for this gameplay session and that worked out great because when people push me up close just quickly switch to that mp5 with amp take them out medium range to long range really good extreme ranges yeah you might as well give up you can try but the spread of the bullets is going to be bigger obviously the further away people are but the way the recoil is on this gun also has a massive advantage for you in terms of getting headshots so if you just get this gun fired at a wall you'll see that the first two bullets are quite close together and then the third one jumps up a little bit but what that means in practical terms is that that third bullet if you're not countering the recoil too hard will naturally just hit someone in the head because if you aim at the chest first two bullets hit the chest that third bullet will pop up to the head if someone's full health and armor that's usually an armor break and then it's just one of the bursts to take them out that's why it's so deadly especially at medium range because you're getting the two shots in the chest boom up to the head and then you knock him down or you finish him off with that second burst very strong you know it's quite satisfying to use this kind of gun in a battle royale game too reminds me a lot of the battle rifle from halo and there hasn't really been a good burst fire gun in any br game really for ages i can't remember one anyway so it's uh it's awesome to play a br game where there is it's satisfying just the sound of it getting hit markers spacing out the bus really good fun to use makes a bit of a change absolutely toasted this squad here as well this is like the perfect m16 range when the character model is like a third of that three-time scope that's when you know you're in the sweet spot i think i've got the win here yeah although the gas mask animation nearly ruined me because i couldn't hide yes yeah i think that's when i fell in love with the m16 so i'll be using it man i'm gonna be on that m16 grind now this kind of situation look at the time to kill and yeah that guy was being shot by lachlan as well i think a little bit but this one here check this out just up above spotted the target drills just absolutely drilled in the head two bursts and that guy was gone nice couple of kills here too enemy on top of police that i spotted didn't have armor full health in one burst i think deadly a lot of it can come down to your play style too like the m16 with mounting oh it's even more of a laser beam you get a decent angle mount up just put three bullets in someone's head i'll think twice about peaking you again you can't just run in there obviously it's not really a close range weapon especially when you have a three-time scope on it like this but if you play medium range play to your strength you can also do this kind of thing as well call this the fade away because those three bullets fire like that you can get on target click and then get into cover without them even having a chance to shoot you but this was really annoying we were being pushed by a couple guys with right shields seeing loads more of them hopefully they don't fall into the meta because they're bloody annoying to fight against but a couple of stuns and semtex is all sort of out and i've got the mp5s back up just in case i still using this trailer as well every now and again look at the armor break there the damage but that was on a sprinting target as well it's not like that guy was still still or anything but this kind of end game position australia can be quite useful two downs here without them even having a chance to shoot me i just knew where they were get the angle with the m16 perfect range again two bursts they're gone and that got us the win i think yeah that was the last squad it's a monster man try it out for yourself m16 use that build that i showed as well along the distances here on top of stadium look at that chunked so quick so fast if you throw a couple of headshots in there as well it can be even quicker than that yeah give it a shot so build i'm going with now at the start of the video if you want to copy it it's very good anyways moving on i don't know if you guys saw the warzone cold war season two trailer that came out yesterday didn't reveal too much it was much more of a cinematic with a few locations in the jungle for cold war but the wars and stuff is what i'm interested in it looks like there's going to be three new guns coming which you'll be able to use in cold war and war zone the galil the crossbow like a proper big old-school stock crossbow and a new smg so it'll be really interesting to take a look at those when when that's out some people think there might be a new map i don't think that's coming yet i'd guess that we're much more likely to see that the anniversary of warzone which was sometime in march but we may see some map changes there's been some zombie machines in the warzone wemble mode and it looks like you can activate them i feel like that's a bit of a teaser to what's to come maybe but i don't know if there'll be any big major map changes next week on the 25th perhaps some little things building up to this room in new map whatever it is exciting times for warzone it's been pretty good last couple weeks since the ban wave although a couple days ago when i streamed warzone on youtube we did come across three cheeses in three hours but then we played for three hours today and we didn't have any so i don't know if they've done another bandwave overnight or something but feeling pretty fun for us at the moment i'm enjoying it that's all for today guys thank you for watching as always cheers to all these lovely folks for using my creator code in the store jack frags and all caps i appreciate you if you do use it tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one also you may have noticed that speaking a bit funny today that's because i've got a massive ulcer on my tongue underneath on the right hand side and whenever i talk it's like pushing against my teeth so i'm trying to just naturally stop it doing that so my tongue and my mouth are in funny positions but yeah that's why i'm sure it'll be better by tomorrow but bloody annoying ghosts are anyway guys thanks for watching again if you like the video hit that like great way to support me subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye [Music] you
