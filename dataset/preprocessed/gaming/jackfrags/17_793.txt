in today's video I'm going to show you how are quite this this and this now I'm no talk of expert but as far as I know these are not items that noob should have and I'm definitely a noob but regardless let's see what happened oh you guys look significantly better than me oh my god Jack yeah that's sick em for ya they'll have four times on it it's nice oh god I've got three sites on it okay I don't know that that's unnecessary isn't it what you've got a canted ein site you've got the mentok oh I've got a Camden iron site I've got the nice gay but then on top of the men's go there's a little insight good people spawn here don't they straight away you're going weapons Hagen yeah I've got my crunching ear pods on people in here somewhere but where's the question we don't know let's stick together very quiet so far it may have been someone in this red building there's a good chance that he's upstairs don't see anyone on the stairs there just run this border going after him yeah yeah yeah is there anyone else and I only just have a look I would say defend barely scratched my armor he's got like some sort of rig a doubt backpack I'll put that in my backpack this corners clear down here I think I heard a suppressed shotgun on the ride somewhere you probably only thought was one of us shot at Tom missed and then three of us bow on the corner home yeah shots they were over the river under other trains in front of me that grenade ice kill me oh that's into that he's running he's running away got a hill I saw him run off yet the death stranding backpack he was he was right here and you run off well don't you stop battling if someone cut my stuff in a nearby bush that's fine we'll get it back do you want to go into the red building Adam but we need scars just secure - oh he's down there so he's the cheese jack use the cheese that's it eat it try to get under the track yeah hurt me a bit there well if I should try and flank up the wall ad you want I'll try to keep an eye out for where you might be yeah I think I can get behind him maybe if I go all the way up there I think I'm nearly round behind him add that didn't do him in I've just crept all the way up he knows where I am that's the thing I kinda want to get back to you jack through those sheets of the Backson that's bound to happen oh he looks a lot more trunking than I do yeah yeah yes just running back back on it's the full death stranding bah I underestimated him it was my downfall see if I get behind him is it better to shoot him in the head or shoot me hard if that's what he's got really this is where I thought we'd be Adam well he shot me when I was in the middle of the yard and hit me on my left side and I was looking at this way so he he must have been further than on that way towards the white truck we're heading back to your body now some scouts here I'm back at Toms body top okay I'm dead asleep god I'm on my own now I hate this just try be as still as possible see if I can hear him Adam and Tom were kind of over in that direction Adam was a bit closer to me though when he just died right here in that path I got him I killed him no I spoke like he is armored as hell man yeah he's so chunky well I mean your main objective here is just to get mine and bond stuff into a bush like somewhere safe just it just just in the corner it was somebody somebody nondescript we're all just gonna just come and happen to come across it and then raid like that I'd guess loot him and then get out of there fast the only thing I really want is company hyung telling my gun on every care anything else just a gun in a bush somebody you know I picked up a nice us again for a one five five six four or five nasal Tom yeah I picked it up I'm like a full time scope on it yeah yeah that's fine so do you want to just dispose of it just don't throw it in a nearby trailer nearby Buster quickly yesterday evening on you up from your guy he had the killer body armor is that yeah on the bus class five oh my god he's got three guns in his bag I feel like I've hit the jackpot why is this gun the riad the DTM dr was something look at this i'll dude he's got thermal scope on it it's probably how he found us so easily why isn't anyone else turned up though to kill me I don't get it I think there are a lot of PMC's died there there yeah there was like at least four of the guys dead Jack would it not source more players in though bike Scouts well later on yes no careful what I mean load yourself up you want your students track points dorms eggs easy be 101 two's there be 101 one and all the gas station well 101 again you've got to go down the roads have you been to the what the bunker before the extract one Cruiser mmm don't think so I don't know the month on so you'll have to just tell me where to go I guess and I'll tell you where I am okay guiding private Jack acordes your current lady and the customs big red so you've just took the gap in the wall yeah yeah all right we need to go across one of those like bridges across the river yeah so I need to cross the river yeah okay cross the river I wonder guide me through here on up don't that scope is so cool out of the thermal the thermal scope yeah I've never used that before we've got one now if you extract when you go across the river they said oh you go cross this little land bridges yeah you're gonna cross one now yeah I'm gonna cross the land bridge okay so then you get to the top it's the are you AF roadblock with the tanks you've been there before you remember is that a pyre yeah on the road yeah just keep going there's a road as a tank that's the roadblock yeah where it says welcome to tarkoff yeah follow through the road go through the gates there is this usually stops there though remember okay so if I can take him up okay I've gone left I'm following the road follow the wall all the way to the end yeah cuz they gonna get stuck on the bridge so there's another gate here yeah go through that so you've been through the gate you've gone for the second gate yeah through the second gate now you should see this so this sucker shot like you know it's open you can see the road goes right doesn't it yeah you need to follow that right road but I just followed all follow the white wall to stick to the wall okay there is lots of scabs so then to your left you've got the dorms but you don't go down there through the forest serene by the white wall keep going that way you'll get past a bus stop okay so I've gone ride the junction I see the bus stop and there is stabs on that road sometimes so just careful mm-hmm can't see any on the thermal think on your right there will be a door that's okay it's got the factory key you need and you can go through there that's a shortcut but if you've got a fat key can't go through that it might be over there someone might have used it should be on the right hand wall no it's locked okay so you ever need to go directly well you can have needs to go through directly through the gas station and obviously watch out for any scalps cuz that's a spawn for them and a boss born or if you look in front of you there's a pipe that runs yeah I see the pipe you can't get on top of that pipe and do a running jump over the barbed wire at the end you'll take a tiny bit and it avoids going like yeah you won't go all the way through I'm gonna do a little spin and a jump you should be able to get over the barbed wire and I'm gonna attempt it oh gosh Godspeed this is where it is now guys I made it I made it yeah right so keep following that wall no scams up ahead so we turn right go to the wall you'll see the track duct like this all train tracks just follow the train tracks right to the ends okay breaking the walls here going through some shooting at me where was that from not on the right what where is this guy is your pie don't see oh there he is okay okay got it all right that was scary I'm back on the train track now I'm gonna keep pushing up it's a really dark now oh god I can barely see anything more scout solder I've dropped him okay so just keep following the train track well just until you tell me when you reach that there's another train car there's a run going up there's a ramp the gold you want to follow that but the train car take a left from that and then follow up the train tracks follow the train tracks left all the way basically it goes to the corn at the very corner of the map yeah and then I gotta show you like this let's go push this pace see where you extract okay I'm running down there now then how'd you get right to the corner there's a tiny little square building you open the door and some stairs going down that's the said b101 one exit yeah I think I see it it kind of looks like a bunker right yeah it's just a small bills looks like a you know a shared almost run in there and hope no one's in there well they could be it's got stairs and down that's the exit I'm going in [Applause] don't think there's anyone here it's the end and it should extract you [Music] yeah I'm clear she made it it made it just for for Jack Jesus intense I only wish Jack had bundle all the guns of his arms like some sense fear that's running okay oh good news is you can just gobble all that down and do a scam run now very good direction stop half goodness is that B 1 11 12 we are our exits I mean sorry I tab back in a fired oh my god Jack I did you just turn back in and it fired I'm sorry fresh swoons lovely I guess that fresh wound means grab Alicia completely alright the bottomless fine the stomach is completely ruined yeah machen if it was a head shot I think I'd just delete the game I think that was just an ogre had a big blue helmet on the cars just in front of us here isn't it yeah I need to go up and unlock the usually a guy on the roof here yeah yeah there is get him dead yet I will come with me Zach this is the pocket watch yeah Paquito let's eat da okey-doke and you need a key for that dear yep don't you open the door and then look in by the footwell and there's a thing you can pick up a sovereign son like them that goes into your bag what was that don't know wasn't us let's regroup back where we were I'm up I'm up put them up a spout Oh God look don't worry it's fine it's a plate vogue is that what are you know that was no one else on near the tank yeah just run this way this time guys I'm a relay he might be down I don't know I him quite a few times but think he's that what's that massive I just put thirty bollocks to the top of his head though he's definitely dead why did he run away when he saw me into the firing I thought I was flunking no no it would I first saw him just ran towards me I went hello bong hey you just earned run run off when everyone looks around he wasn't you he didn't sighs eat me thank you cuz I've lost my stomach I'm on borrowed time now it's my water stripping out it's my water that's gonna run out and then I'll I'll just drop dead I've just drunk a bottle of water topped it back up its dropping really quick so we need to find some water oh that's actually hurting me to run out there my screens fading to black it says hello hello come on yeah I could see your boats because I was because I was sprinting okay we won't spring we'll just walk run day walk walk don't run okay you need like a can of coke or something that's all what's gonna happen well just what happens was fatigue all right you're just tired is that sniper right the top yeah dead you climb all the way up there I don't think so no I don't think so he's just spawns up there he's horrible what if we go in the gas station there might be some food of water in there I should go check it the rest your weary head those guys here though Oh Joe will even be the boss once dead checking foodstuff I don't dislike okay I'll get a jack you sure yeah you said check that guy Ford's it supplies the bomb yeah I'm checking I'm checking no he hasn't anything or no food or anything no nothing about the shelves inside that's not going gas station but Jack yeah I know come and come surely there be some food in here how good is that sniper listen oh it's a quick hint you know you can try I mean if it needs must it's just a plastic line sir why is there no food in the store they just keep healing while we're moving I can unlock these come on wait it's a pantry I know it it's nothing and it's a med bag it's a med bag that might be worthy of it and they put those bandages can you eat tape why is this so many bandages Oh God look at the time I'm helping I've got the whole thing in there you know at least I'm stoned by a sandbag there was a guy father shot sounded like it was at me by that maybe it wasn't might be submitted outpost but there's a couple scams here really laggy what's that a player maybe that was a player he's dead right we're gonna check these bodies see if I can find any food I'm running up the road now Big Shot is that you guys eating no that's a sniper or something then I see him I think there's a plan it was a plan I killed have just shot me oh wow I said is anyone is anyone there this is my guys
