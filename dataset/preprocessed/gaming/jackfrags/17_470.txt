hi everyone hope you're doing well happy new year if it's already 2021 where you live if not then happy new year for later this will be the last upload on this channel in 2020 i know it's been a bit of a crazy difficult year for a lot of people all over the world i just wanted to do a live commentary today talking chatting but instead we're gonna focus on some of the positive things that we've seen and done this year and hopefully keep growing and improving next year yeah nothing will really change overnight but i think there is some significance in turning the page and jumping into a new year the footage you're seeing today is a bit of a meme like i said in the previous video with the ak-47 rocket gun which loads of you guys like that video which is great it was a lot of fun to to play that and make it so thank you for your support on that today it's two m4s i thought it would be a bit of a laugh just run with an m4 and the new xm4 absolutely awful loadout never do this never copy it the m4 is still a good gun if you build it with the classic meta m4 but the xm4 it's not the one i was using it as an smg in these games we actually ended up winning like three matches yeah i would not recommend running a dual m4 loadout warzone of course is just dominated at the moment by the dmr can't wait for there to be a patch hopefully it's gonna come next week or the week after when the studio is back because it is a bit insufferable to play at the moment when everyone's using the dmr but it is what it is so there you go so for me personally i wanted to start this year by saying thank you so much to you guys for all the support on the channel but most importantly for the generosity that you showed earlier in the year i was inspired by a friend to set up a fundraiser for a charity called special effects and they help disabled people get access to video games by giving them advice building them bespoke custom equipment information whatever it is i think they're a great charity i did this overnight i just thought you know what let's do it let's see how much we can get and originally i think i put the goal at five thousand dollars and i announced this in a war zone video and within two hours it was already at ten thousand dollars so i kept increasing the donation goal increasing it increasing it and by the time the fundraiser ended you guys had donated 57 797 for these guys which was just i was speechless i was like i can't believe that we've done that 2 385 supporters donated to that and that money will go such a long way to helping people get access to games so yeah once again i did say thank you back then but just to wrap up the year like that's that's crazy like the fact that you guys chipped in and you helped it's gonna make a difference to so many people honestly it's great so i'm really proud of you thank you so much for getting on board with that and jumping in in terms of the growth of the channel last year i did a video every single day and then in january of this year i did a big analytical thing where i broke everything down and which ones were most successful which ones didn't do so well total views subscribers that kind of thing i might do that this year we'll see i haven't done a video a day every year this year i just didn't want to go at it as hard so i don't know if i'll do a full breakdown but i wanted to give you guys a few stats right now just to show you how things are going so in 2019 the channel scored 211.5 million views and gained 259 000 subscribers and of course i was over the moon with that but in 2020 we are missing a couple days because the data is usually 24 to 48 hours behind but this year we scored 283.9 million views so a bit of a bump there and we've gained 536 000 subscribers so lots of growth this year which is awesome again big thank you from me and of course a lot of that has come down to war zone warzone released in march and i think it was just a perfect storm right at the start of the lockdown free-to-play cross-platform great gun play cool map in-depth customization with the loadouts and everything the introduction of a gulag and being able to buy your mates back if they needed a respawn everyone could play together it just went down really well and because of warzone i decided to go hard with that game put a load of content together from guides loadout videos just me and mates having fun messing around on it the crazy things you could do in warzone which was super cool and yeah it's have its ups and downs we've had broken guns along the way and we've got a couple right now we've had plenty of cheaters definitely a problem with those and there still is from time to time you've got the skill based matchmaking debate which has been going on but generally speaking the amount of hours that i've played warzone the amount of fun i've had the amount of videos that i've created from it it's been a blast for me this year and also being involved with the alternate reality game stuff where activision infinity ward treyarch sent me some stuff in real life and it was part of the puzzle with the chess piece and the projectors and the nuke stuff like that was really awesome to be involved with that i'm just generally working with activision on sponsorships getting the support of creator code as always huge thank you to anyone who's used that this year and there are rumors already that there's gonna be a new map in march i don't know how accurate those rumors are but that'll be cool to see and it would make sense seeing as it launched in march and that would be its first anniversary so i'm sure there'll be a ton of warzone content coming up in 2021 in regards to the other major game franchise that i covered battlefield i think it was in april dice announced that they stopped supporting the game so no further real content for the game they were focusing on the next game they announced the same for battlefront 2 so dice are obviously all hands on deck for the next battlefield game they've left a bit of a gap between the game so i'm expecting big things in holiday next year but battlefield videos always perform really well on my channel whether it's just gameplay or theory crafting talking about news whatever it is bf5 videos in particular do really well i still really enjoy playing all the battlefield games and apparently you guys like watching them based on the stats so that will continue and i'm sure we'll ramp up when we know more about the next game probably i'd guess around april may june that kind of time is usually when they announce so battlefield's gonna be huge next year looking forward to it i did do a little bit of escape from tarkov in january the start of the year it was popular on twitch when they did the loot drops but i didn't really take to it that well and i didn't feel like i understood the game as much it's had a bit of a surge in popularity recently they're doing twitch drops again and they've just done a wipe so i might jump back on board i know acolyte was perhaps interested in playing some games with me and showing me the ropes because he is way better at the game understands it way better than i do so we might do some stuff there hell let loose has been a constant source of enjoyment for me as well this year it's definitely a more challenging game and the skill curve on it's quite steep it's hard to get into but if you play with the squad hell at least can be great fun and i have been making videos periodically through the year on hell let loose they've done some great game updates there too so i'm sure we'll see much more of that and then i suppose as we're coming towards the end of the year for me personally covering the new next-gen consoles was awesome xbox and playstation 5 they sent me both of the new next-gen consoles a little bit early so i could make videos on them play the games show you guys content what those consoles were like so i did dip into the techie side of things a bit more and those videos got great responses great views lots of positive sentiment in the comments so i'm really happy with that and i hope you guys enjoyed those vids too just unfortunate that so hard to get them this year but i'm sure march april next year there'll be loads more stock and really it won't be until holiday next year that we'll see some true next-gen games appearing also working with nvidia as well on the launch of the 3080 and the 3090 i've done a load of sponsored stuff with nvidia this year from live streams to videos they're great to work with too and it was sweet to be able to get all those cards and again show the performance of them in early access content similar to the consoles they are quite hard to get hold of though but hopefully that will get better soon live streaming has been pretty big for me this year and that was one of my resolutions for the year so i upgraded my internet and since september i've been live streaming in 4k so i've been playing games in 4k live streaming in 4k maxing out the bitrate and the quality on youtube i don't know if there's any other channel streaming in 4k for gaming it probably is one or two but i've got to the stage now where i'm really happy with my internet with my streaming pc the quality i love live streaming interacting with you guys leaving it up as a vod afterwards so anyone that missed the live stream can watch it anyways and there'll be way more live streaming in 2021 but yeah i suppose that's it just speaking from the heart really today as always a huge thank you to everyone who's tuned in this year and subscribed kept on watching the videos kept on coming back for more massive thanks to all the other content creators that i've played with this year one of my goals for this year that i said at the start of the year was to try and collaborate with more people and i definitely feel like i've done that this year and it's great to see so many of my friends who i play with regularly and record with also growing their channels and doing what they love and yeah i'm just quite positive that things will start to get back to normal by maybe june july 2021 when a lot more people have been vaccinated and we've done more national lockdowns and hopefully we start to get everything under control anyways with that said got loads of content planned for the new year once again a happy new year to you i hope you're safe i hope your family is well take care of yourselves take care of each other subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye-bye uh directly northwest
