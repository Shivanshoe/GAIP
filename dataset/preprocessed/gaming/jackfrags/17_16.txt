today we're doing more sniper elite five invasions otherwise known as ruining people's day simulator to get you up to speed basically you match make into a random person single player level as a sniper hunter and you have to hunt them down and kill them ultimately ending their game you can really mess with people if they kill you though you're kicked out of their game they get xp and that counts as a loss for you it's a deadly game of cat and mouse a great concept and simply put it's incredible i hope you enjoyed this if you do leave a like and a comment below thank you right we're back are you styled already where are they gunshots down here up there what was that there's a mark in that building too dead guys hang on they just they just stood right there i'm just gonna send it [Applause] oh no in the side of the face well that first one was pretty easy this is a big amount though i think oh is that them the glint over there i know that sometimes it can be ai glint like an ai sniper okay right so they've done an objective so that means that that is just a friendly yeah friendly sniper so where was it there's some smoke here so it could be around here oh hello they just peeking around the corner with the camera that's a kill oh no we got a man down here oh shocking look at that who was it imagine if they were in that tower there this looks new round here so i think i'm in the right spot the fire is still raging there too maybe inside no nobody there no one looking for him oh there i completely missed goodbye i've gotta shoot at me dude that's the wrong way i didn't realize that they could do that that's new i almost completely blew that one not today this is guernsey in the english channel i couldn't tell if that was in front of me or behind me i played this map i don't recognize it i'm still not done the campaign i mean that tower looks like quite a nice ah but they've destroyed a radio mast on the coast somewhere and where would that be i mean it's a lot of beach isn't there it's an island so okay i'm looking for a radio mast there's one there maybe that's where they are then okay i don't see any other radio mass so i think they are actually over there somewhere so i'm gonna head over there now there's the tower so i guess the sniper could just be in there still the thing is this isn't going to be easy to get across is it there's so many windows there they do have a phone in there though so i don't know why they've not used it yet they use that sounders cover to sprint in where are you could be upstairs [Music] okay this is pretty tense now i don't know where this guy's gone oh they just shot someone there is oh in the shoulder so they actually moved out the building they got in a firefight in that little bunker there gave it away gg this is so good i love this what the pigeon what's that for why would there be a a cardboard cut out of a pigeon oh i don't know it's some kind of mock-up of a u.s city and then that's like new york it's a theater or a bar politician's office school maybe why would they do that i don't know look at this place massive cathedral beaumont saint denny i don't know much about this place in world war ii what happened here massive cathedral look at this level design though that's crazy i suppose you could get up there [Music] come on is this entire map yeah it's mostly just a big cathedral in the middle that's cool anyway i need to focus on finding the sniper i can hear gunshots over there down to the left you hear mr sniper this place is crazy the amount of verticality look at that painting very renaissance that isn't it like salvatore rose kind of thing in that hut down there maybe just kind of looks like harry potter tower how do i get down there there's a little monastery or a church down there or something what someone just screamed right they're definitely down there dead guys [Music] many dead guys over on the left that's a friendly they're right down here better go they had no idea there absolutely no idea another one let's go i kind of wish that i could drive these vehicles look at this this one's so fancy that's just a truck that's fancy are you sucking on the job mate come on ship shape we've got something going on over here look this is where i hit that really long range shot last time oh i wanted to go for it i missed i thought that could have been the money shot you know they just go in the barn i think they're just on the other side of this wall here i just keep creeping and they're in that barn they're right there i just heard them reload what the massacre i'm gonna jump in we are danger close now i don't think they saw me then he's right there look guy's got no idea trying to take down so we've got any time to talk about your extended car warranty please can you imagine the jump scare can you imagine it oh so good you can unlock an stg for the secondary what what about pistols oh that looks like a luger doesn't it should i go with that type 100 no the damage is much better on the mp40 look at these boys there what are they doing it looks like hagrid's motorcycle adventure universal studios i mean that is just a motorbike at the end of the day i guess these guys are just on a patrol then all right more lads on a patrol swinging that ng-42 around very nice can i send them into hyperdrive it just goes super fast it's like i'm back at hogsmeade where's the butterbeer i love all these little vines that you can climb i don't think i even realized you could do that the first time that i played you know so many little flanking routes that you could make i think they get auto pinged like if they just camp in a building and don't move for a while it spots them automatically it might be an overlooked position here they're right there okay if they come across that wall i'll go for a sniper shot they were eliminated for camping that's a thing that can happen i didn't know that they can literally be killed for camping that's when you know you're a true camper when the game decides right that's enough mate come on you're at the game so many parts of the levels that i've not really seen or discovered yet it's a beautiful looking game look at the size of that what is it an antenna relay maybe i'm not sure is this like most code equipment here communication devices i bet if you're a history buff you know exactly what this is the online engineer killed the sniper nope i mean it wins a win right right now this map has got red circles everywhere is it just where the ai are like alerted oh these guys are looking down here why are you looking down there are you using your butt wall hack to see the enemy player through the walls is that what's going on here tell me what you saw tell me right now he's not going to tell me i'll go down there then can i climb down that oh maybe i can whoa oh you can hang off it oh you can jump across as well i'm such an idiot for not knowing you could do this kind of stuff if i played the single player i guess i'd know wouldn't i look this gone full tomb raider now imagine the sniper's just looking at me doing this like what is this idiot doing oh maybe there's been some kills here that's weird there's just four mp40s and these guys over here appear to be alerted as well no it's a friendly the plot beckons that's where you going you're trying to show me the way oh no you split up damn it i don't know what to do now confused so i was in completely the wrong location we're in this tower here i think grenade [Music] what was that can i even get a grenade in there does that work i've been tagged that's a trap isn't it [Music] okay i think they're just camping up here [Music] yes [Music] oh that was a nice one that was cool just hold up in here chilling good i am starting to learn the maps a little bit as well i feel like i'm just because i've done like 15 or 16 invasions now if i play the single player though is it actually good let me know it's so picturesque and beautiful let's shoot that down hmm that looks like something that you could shoot down and drop on ahead maybe because i'm invading i can't interact with it is this guy just reading practicing their lines maybe i think there's supposed to be a guy here so i'm gonna be the guy yeah i understand totally yeah i agree with you i think if we send the troops to the western line there hang on i think i heard it i'll be back what was it a large big mac drink milkshake strawberry milkshake okay got it oh you're running why are you running why are you running something happened i'm just going for a nice jog in the countryside here it's peaceful summer's day ignore the fact that i've got a pistol a sniper rifle and an smg it's just to add some extra weight so i can train more effectively i promise right okay there's definitely something over here oh wait it's just a bike exploding was i baited oh no oh no sir what happened that's a rough way to go if i was a sniper where would i be um dead guys here as well so did they come through this way i'm on the wall path here look this body's everywhere i can smell them i think i'm getting closer okay phones are available use this that's not how you use a phone 200 meters i think i was in roughly the right area i just wasn't thorough enough apparently didn't look in the right place are they in the tower here is that the head there yep oh i thought i saw it oh my goodness that was so cool god there's nothing else like this is it really is there any other shooter game that you can do this kind of thing in or the war factory now this is an awesome level it doesn't come up that much though this is one of the first ever levels that i've played wasn't it hello i don't think you would spawn that close to the sniper would you no surely not enemy snipers completed an objective but pray tell which objective i don't know where they are i've got no idea sometimes it gives you the cutscene dead guy imagine you could drive one of those okay my location's revealed something went off here was it a flare if you're playing this if there's any tips i could give you if your location is revealed just move as soon as possible because it isn't a live track or anything it just shows you where you were at the time but they're going to be moving to where i was which was over there maybe they've gone straight there it must feel horrible being the person that's being hunted in your single player game the difficulty just spikes doesn't it you think it's like mr x in resident evil or nemesis in resident evil hunting you down constantly i go on these pipes i keep i can go in the pipes okay right this is full enemy at the gates doesn't this happen in enemy at the gates i'm pretty sure it does good match so far this i've not been able to locate them at all okay they've got my location [Music] 300 meters away i'm just gonna send it i think can't be waiting around in before they go to where i was and i go to where they were yeah i find that the single players though always tend to be more passive as soon as they know that you've located them they'll just kind of stay there if it was me i'd move straight away i'd be out there [Music] well i don't think they're going to be in here still but it's worth a look isn't it the hell was that is that the move there i'm sure i saw movement then they're gonna be around one of these corners god this is horrible how do you get in there i think we keep missing each other [Music] was that mine [Music] oh well played i don't know how that mine didn't kill me that was a good match man my heart was starting to go there i thought that guy might beat me gg okay we'll do one more maybe they didn't expect me to just climb the ladder straight away and they thought i would heal instead oh that guy's happy i spawned in he was right here they're carrying supplies around hmm oh okay well that's a dead giveaway imagine if the enemy sniper left muddy footprints on the road because it's raining how good would that be okay so enemy snipers in there then 100. is that them there in the bunker window it's difficult to tell i think i saw them right there could have been ai though okay they're in here they just shot the ai there didn't they let's get a grenade try and get a grenade kill kobe oh my god i think it got him yes that's my first grenade kill oh my goodness yes that's a good one that's a nice way to end it isn't it cheeky grenade kill guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like leave a comment
