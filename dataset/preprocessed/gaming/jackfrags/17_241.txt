hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to call of duty vanguard beta so a couple hours ago well it's three hours ago now the early access beta went live and it's on pc now i think it was on playstation only last weekend but this weekend we've got playstation xbox and pc so we're going to be hopping on and playing for a couple of hours i haven't leveled anything up i just jumped into a game to get a thumbnail so i've not really played the game yet but i'm interested to see if they've made any improvements from the previous beta because there was a couple of things with the gameplay that i you know is a little bit critical of footsteps the visual effects when you shoot it difficult to see visibility wise and i think they've added some new guns for this beta they've also added search and destroy so we might try that and i think is there a couple new game modes as well i don't think there's any new maps we're looking at the weapons here i can't i'm i'm not level four so it's reset my progress that's fine [Music] killstreaks that's all the same i think yeah so we're gonna have some fun thank you for tuning in guys if you're watching this live i appreciate you thank you for being here if you're watching it as a vod thank you very much as well hopefully we can get some decent games in here and also for the duration of the live stream i do have 10 codes to give away big thanks to activision they gave me 10 early access beta codes so at the moment it's not open beta until the 18th so in a couple days it'll be full open beta but if you want to play it now i think you've gotta be in the early access so i'll be dropping 10 codes in the chat and they are for pc xbox and playstation and if you get one maybe you can check out the game for yourself hello wicked gust mike what's up x factor how's it going brown how are you doing nick thank you for the two bazinga right that said we're gonna queue into a game here see what we get first i might do some champion hill as well because we didn't play that when we did the previous live stream it was just all multiplayer what's up intron ducky ashafar how you doing hope you're all having a fantastic week it is a thursday evening well it is for me at least it's been a very busy week very very busy are we going we're going straight in 14 v14 red star i think this is the map that i've played the least as well so this would be interesting so we've got full cross play going on here we've got playstation pc a couple of xbox players there at the bottom let's check it out here we go now i feel like this is a sniper map but i don't know if the default sniper loadouts are any good that they give you these two are locked so those are new guns aren't they team deathmatch team deathmatch this will separate the wheat from the chef oh wow yeah i need to tweak my mouse sensitivity as well put it on toggle ads as well because this is hold and i i can't stand using hold i know i know a lot of people use hold and they're fine with it it seems like that's the default now for a lot of people but i have always used toggle so i need to change that i wonder if we can play this first game using hold see how it goes it's the mp40 isn't it [Music] what's up explicit rando hello blando chris welcome guys thank you for coming along [Applause] so we're playing this on pc this is native 1440p here i don't suppose the mp4 is going to be any good at that kind of range is it atticus thank you for the five that's very kind of my man thank you this guy's got gas on it i didn't even know there was gas in the game to be honest with you guys we're falling behind what can you get hold on i'm going to be the kool-aid man you guys ready for this yeah oh yeah oh you can do it twice that's kind of cool why are you dead who killed you nine millimeter parabellum i kind of feel like i need a class which has got stuns on oh my god is that a rocket took a gas nape there stop anyone pushing oh where'd you come from i know where what are my obs settings um well i'm streaming at 1440p that's what you mean pretty much max quality 18 000 bit rate why did i pick up this shotgun i want my mp40 back i've ruined everything guys should i just throw a grenade at my feet this shotgun can't be good on this map right uh harry thank you for the five yeah i mean they haven't really said anything about it have they so we just don't know that's better ow is this a custom stg they've built here you know what it does actually feel a bit different to last week i don't know whether it's the mouse or the frame rate maybe ready i'll tell you what this isn't a bad position is it that's it for the intel i use this glide bomb i think if i just put it down here maybe oh it's really difficult to control that's a miss yeah of course it's a miss i can't control the damn thing what's up emmanuel hey jamie it would be great if you let everyone know that jordan sucks at cod oh jamie you've been mean to your friend there haven't you i'm sorry jordan i was debated into that one maybe i should have carried on shooting there oh you can't hit fire with that execution kill stone i'll try it i will try it oh we got a little flank on here there's an enemy up here i'll start doggies no we don't want that that really confused me because the shadow look at all these poppers that shadow was above and i looked at the shadow rather than the player hey intron was it wild type that's entirely up to you again entirely up to you probably not great idea that i'm just running through this open bit in the middle with an mp40 is it [Applause] jump in there i'm gonna jump in there [Applause] am i seeing things i swear it's turned into a polar bear gerard thank you for the two you should voice over all the game trailers i don't think i'd uh be very good at that to be honest with you there are people with much better voices than is [Music] throwing gammon i just threw some pork at them did i i mean what ah squished into me dude catch you reloading how you doing today jack did i get caught reloading today yeah i think i've been killed reloading once in this match is it out on xbox yeah in early access yeah chan what's up hey dj gibbs i wouldn't be surprised if the dog did turn into a polar bear you know what i'm gonna watch that back at some point when this becomes avoid afterwards i'm gonna watch that back and i swear there's a frame there where the dog turned into a polar bear maybe that's just my worst nightmare and i'm projecting onto the game you know my brain is making me see things that aren't really there interesting thing about polar bears by the way a couple weeks ago i went round the tower of london in london as a matter of fact and they had a as like a pole a polar bear out the front like a an art statue of a polar bear made out of wire and you know it was a bit confusing like why is there a polar bear at the tower of london and if you go through the whole tour you get to a bit where you learn that back in back in the olden days back in the crazy days you know before people really had safety procedures or knew what they were doing the visitors that came there would bring exotic animals as gifts to the king at the time and once someone brought a polar bear and they used to have a polar bear there they had they had monkeys they had uh tigers i think they had a cheater there at one point but then they had to end it all because one of the cheaters like lashed out at a kid and they fell off one of the walls and uh it didn't end very well for them i'd say so then they stopped doing it but apparently that's how the kings of olden times used to try and one-up each other that's what the rich people used to do mate i'll tell you what you know i've just been i've just been to the antarctic i got myself i've got a polar bear do you want this go on then are you gonna want up a polar bear that's not a bad first game is it considering that we were just talking trash uh we got a donation from nicholas thank you for the 100 that's very kind of you mike thanks for the five is the beta out on xbox right now in early access yeah so i'm gonna drop two codes in the chat right now first come first serve helen thank you very much for the five that's very kind you i recognize you from before helen thank you i know you've been watching for a while uh byron thank you for the five been watching you forever love the content second only to neebs gaming on youtube can't beat battlefield friends neebs gaming a legends man they're great [Music] yeah if you're watching the stream and enjoying it guys hit the like button thank you it's a great way to support me two polar bears was it i need to switch my aim because i said i'd do that it's in gameplay isn't it [Music] ain't on site behavior there it is toggle i don't think i really need to change much else i mean it's just the baser right now so those codes can be used on any platform but first come first serve like i said you go to that website put the code in pick what platform you want and then that will give you another code and then you can redeem that on pc xbox or playstation uh dog thank you for the one hey gabrielle what's up casito how are you done i give it come in hey sam colt online cinema what's up i do use toggle yeah i've always used toggle i think it's because i've been playing pc games since like 1996 and originally they only ever had toggle and then as more games came out they decided to introduce hold and stuff but i just never got used to hold team deathmatch search and destroy we try champion hill maybe mr gibson 4040p stream looks great thank you man is it cross-platform yeah yeah we were playing with oh look at this it's put me in just the pc lobby for champion hell [Music] i mean that's input based matchmaking right there at its finest yeah so the previous game we were playing with xbox and playstation players boston thank you for the five man love it andrew cheers for the tent is for your delay woes thank you andrew wasn't rw sign my finger i mean it just rub off wouldn't it wash off in the shower i presume that you take showers [Music] hoggling since 1994 that's it andrew [Music] when are you going to play daily defeat again we need your batman oh man dare defeat absolutely banging game that was such a good mod for half-life and then they made day defeat sauce which wasn't quite as good but it was still good what's up joe i'm just queuing up random thank you man thank you for offering welcome to champion hill friends uh helen that's a good point actually we need a command for that for discord if you want to join the discord go to jackfrags.com and there's some instructions there how to get on it what's up corey who's my oh my partner's abraham lincoln i get the bomb i've not played this since the early capture event weapons i just bought i don't know if i can buy any weapons at the start armor plate full armor yeah i mean you want that don't you really a grenade for free cool right abraham lincoln what did i need some abraham lincoln quotes i don't know much about abraham lincoln 10 seconds until start time or scorn seven years is that right something like that i know he's got a big statue in marble where he sat on a big seat and you go some stairs was it bizarre hey jf welcome to champion hill and all other teams for the week this is a really interesting game mode you have 12 lives in total every minute you rotate and play again against a different duo and if you lose all your lives you're out the game can get really intense i mean i've died twice and i think mr lincoln's died twice careful there you go also abraham lincoln was a vampire hunter so we lost that one 4-3 so the enemy team are going to get bonus cash and there'll come a point in the game where you can spend that money on upgrades so we're against a different team here there's usually an extra life as well somewhere there it is cook this nade can upgrade my weapon as well if i want put a little sight on it not actually sure if i like that site cool that's a really good round for us six to one so we i think we get a bit of cash there these guys have only got four lives spawns flipped there i think you got the extra life and they've got one life left so one thing that i don't like about this mode is how you can hear the other you can hear the other arenas fighting and that's really off-putting at times because you think that it's in your match but it's actually not you got 10 seconds so i think they've been eliminated now oh no oh wow they were just hiding in the corner that was a waste we just lost two lives still won that though is it a buy round now it might be a buy round nope it is a buy round cool so what should we get then how much money have i got stock up while you can three thousand and fifty man if i get an sdg upgrade a little bit ghost that's probably a really good perk to have just 10 more seconds spy plane gammon bomb a couple more upgrades for the sdj okay we're in the lead right now but this game mode can flip on its head suddenly spy planes up once that was a nice double kill they were just lined up there for some reason [Music] double kill all right that's them out i think oh no they've still got one life left he's over here you've got 10 seconds i don't know why we're still fighting these guys surely they're out now yeah we eliminate them okay well there's um nice work soldier a load of money good good good feeling spicy i like this very good oh what why are these guns here mad upgrades there on the stg oh they're playing super passive can hear one above me we got the extra life that dude was shooting at me right from over here somewhere [Music] wow visibility was pretty bad there you got ten seconds i've only got three lives play a bit passive ah damn that's a shame i feel like we should have won that one we're playing against fox this is where it gets really tense there's one quick reload nice he got my life just played passive vape oh baby yes eliminated two lives left [Laughter] come on there's a byron before the final round as well how much money do i have 3200 spy plane on the plate okay all right here we go we're gonna kill this guy oh they're on their own their teammates left the game i think only ten seconds left oh no they're over there it's gonna be tight gonna be really close this one here we go i think i bought a spy plane didn't i we've got a life advantage one went over here they're actually just prone nice abe he was here somewhere the other guy left one life left give it your all is he above me he's gonna be camping somewhere for sure 1v1 hey we got him i think no that's gotta be it yes oh baby man that really gets your heart going i know it doesn't really like mean anything but it's um it's pretty intense at the end there did my stg have incendiary bullets on it then is that is that what that was as you can put 10 attachments on the guns in this game that i've unlocked any yet yeah i don't know why they kept respawning maybe it's because they got an extra life or something [Music] are we gonna drop another code in the chat here guys eagle's nest this map's crazy glenn have you played half-life alex no i haven't i watched lyric play it it looked really good i don't think i'd play it myself though raphael max upgrading champion hilly's incendiary okay that explains that so this is one of the guns that wasn't in the base last week and this is basically the sturmgiver i think that's what it's called i feel like this is going to be the meta rifle when this comes to warzone as well look at that i mean that's that's a warzone gun isn't it right there [Applause] oh you move really fast with it oh my god i heard footsteps maybe i've improved the footsteps a little bit what the hell was that i got a kill with my lethal then but i don't know what it what it was what is it like a incendiary or something it's gonna burn and kill people now a bit of destruction in this bit sir ready for report oh yeah imagine doing like running through running through a wooden barricade while getting on the phone to your co so you can call in the uav a dragon it's a thermite yeah i think i think i'd like the footsteps to be a bit louder no one hurts my people oh just termite myself cool it didn't go through the bush it just hit the leaves the gunshots don't sound the same yeah maybe they've changed something was hiding in the corner ow uh he was blending in with the bookcase what's up crash how's it going any more codes yeah we've got eight more codes to drop this is not a hip fire gun oh they're behind us stuki i'm dead a solid bush yes it was indeed a solid solid bush eric you don't see many of those nowadays huh it's quite rare oh come on that's my kill what's up mccreed hey jay hey bill intron oh okay [Applause] uh that literally fills up the entire screen i didn't realize i had a panzer shrek as my secondary on this class is it a one-hit kill oh no well it was a one-hit kill when i smashed it with it in the face yeah was it vaughn oh try again i mean you move very very slowly with it it's not going up grenade i kind of want to just repel down here and see what's down there but you just end up dying if you do that yeah i want to see if this is a one-hit kill if you like just miss you know yeah this gun's going to be mad in war zone because obviously they're going to integrate this game into warzone so all these guns that you see now will be in war zone i don't know whether they'll be there at launch or will it just be when they do the new map but there's gonna be a whole new meta it's gonna be crazy hey name it panzer shrek literally translates to tank scarer really i know panzer's tank but shrek i mean shrek's just a big green guy that lives in a swamp right but in german apparently it's scared all right it's not a one-hit girl only if you hit him i think that's fair yeah there's an mg42 imagine that in warzone i mean warzone's already got an mg34 right so oh my that's the ultimate head glitch right there i hate that i need to go kill that guy we get a flank on here maybe [Applause] i think i blew it trying to be sneaky sneaky biggie ready for report intelligence coming in mark in hostile location ah come through the wall there i think that's a good game we lost by five points though unfortunate uh rob is the m1 garand in the game yeah it is is sean going to play with you do you mean jacksepticeye i don't think so i don't i don't know if he's into this hey benny what's up david are we rank four now so we can actually make loadouts so we're gonna have a look everything level one most things are level one that one's got ghosts on it though so you can put 10 on you know what's really interesting have you guys seen that iron trials mode for war zone that's actually got a blueprint in it that has 10 attachments and i feel like that's raven and call of duty's way to slowly top start testing what 10 attachments is like in warzone you know they're going to start creeping that in but imagine when this game is out um you can use 10 attachments in warzone like that's that's pretty crazy isn't it some dudes join my party orbs playing as well connor's playing warzone yes duo's only in tron for that game mode spm yeah i think javier it's probably got spf in yeah same engine as modern warfare and probably using the same system as that what gpu 30-90 hello teddy bear open beta starts on the 18th argentina i like this map this is my favorite map so far but they said in a pre brief that we had a couple months ago that there's going to be 20 maps at launch 20 maps that's just crazy let's put me in a game already eradicate all threats this one might be easy i feel like they've toned down the smoke as well on the gun raphael thanks for the five keep up the good work hope to see some nice easter egg videos on 2042 thank you man i think there is a ping on the ground sorry i'm just i'm looking at the the smoke effects i'm sure there used to be like a little distortion if you look at the iron sight i think that's gone now which is good i mean you can see a bit better when you shoot it's a little sniper nest here oh someone had a sniper there i can't get over when they say throwing gum and it just sounds so weird you go all the way out here [Applause] snipers take so long to eds typical one shot to the chest is anyone going to go and try and deny that one is there one up there is there chosen grenade i want just like everyone to run down here [Applause] can you do that guys can you run down here that'd be great i don't think they're going to do it guys what's that foregrip i don't know i mean yeah it's a game like they've uh definitely taken some artistic liberties with attachments historical modifications you could make to guns in world war ii you know it's a video game i'm cool with it it's not a realistic world war two game and the sdg just owns a range so good [Applause] there's an attachment that you can get for the sdg that looks like it belongs on a tommy gun oh no poor dogger yeah that takes so long to destroy you're mowing them down oh no thanks to me [Applause] there's gonna be someone camping on this boat i knew it shipment 944 this map's a bit bigger than shipment didn't think i'm come back did y'all know didn't i you got me double kill double kill they've got the most british cockney man ever as well to do that they literally went to london i went in hostile right who's got the most cockney accent around here then is it you right then fluency los angeles or wherever sledgehammer games are basically can you shout some things in their microphone and then he just did it does the wall zone update excite you yeah definitely a lot i mean the current warzone map has got really stale for me so the fact that they're doing a new map it's a big deal for me personally i'm i mean it's going to be fresh new exciting i think a lot of laps players will come back and try it for a bit learning all the new areas the spots sniper angles easter eggs yeah i mean i'm really excited for the warzone map it's a completely different biome environment as well progress from the bay to save for full release tom thank you for the two i don't think so tom i don't think they'd do that doesn't make sense because then people would have a head start when the game comes out feels unfair moose whisperer what's up hey ennis seth what's up hey snoke what's up dan franklin hey nicholas comstock that's a good second name if that's your real name nicholas there is an m1 garand sushi yeah i just i don't think i've unlocked it yet no i can put an optic on i need to be level three for that stuff this isn't really an uh assault rifle map though is it i'll choose the thompson box team deathmatch subdue all threats nice little inspect feature there training's over that's the eiffel tower over here the gas isn't usually there though oh my god i just wanted to show the stream the eiffel tower please friends i'm being watched this is server lagging i've seen multiple people sliding around what's going on with that grenade we're in the lead i feel like it's lagging a bit everyone's leaving as well [Music] yeah server was really laggy how many maps in the beta uh i want to say four plus champion hill [Music] dan thank you do you think he'll let loose on ps5 will work given it's more realistic yeah i think it will i think it'll be good there's a lot of console players that have really been begging out for hardcore shooters what the hell just played all the sounds at the same time mg42 go on then someone in chat asked me if i'd use i it you're ready for a real fight we're doing it domination don't forget code jack frags in the store boys yeah is my game sound messed up stephen no it just sounds like the the audio in the game is just a bit funky at the moment like it sounds a little bit muffled doesn't it i wanna i want it to get a bit crispier you know i want him to punch it up a bit i want him to tighten up the graphics on level five that's an old man [Applause] hostile record in the air you do run a lot slower with the mg of course nice lighting effect there not great for visibility though um matt thank you for the fire thanks for all the great entertainment all these years happy upcoming 10th anniversary matt we're doing something special for the 10th anniversary nothing major just um a little cosmetic change pretty cool [Applause] i wonder if you get a bonus when you mount with the mg42 oh yeah i can't resist every time i see that i have to do it i am the kool-aid man like do i get a bonus if i'm not with the mj [Applause] i'm not sure the energy is to play guys maybe not on this map please don't bomb me please don't bomb me fps is really good though i mean it's running well spoilers in the sky you can slide a little bit as well in your mouth i'm a slidy boy you think they're going to put that in war zone what do you reckon i can be the true world war 2 sweat lord here guys [Applause] caleb thank you you were wondering if i had any shirts i do limited edition releases i don't have any at the moment but there will be more designs coming up in the future there'll definitely be one around november yeah in time for christmas i mean this is it's not bad really is it but you might appear with the mg no one's really firing at me but this is full sweat lord mode right here i don't usually play like this but it's quite fun to be a sweat lord not that i'm playing the objective or anything because i'm not good location you can how did i do that beefy jojo left the game that's a great name hey it's me beefy jojo what's up almost i love sandwiches i'm just going back to my window yeah hey bro get out my window it's my window i am the sweat lord i'm getting made in there for the intel toby mg42 that's a lot of hit markers [Music] this looks like an enemy at the gates map i think i mean it's based off stalingrad yeah enemy at the gates has that whole section doesn't it with the sniper great movie that is i mean i don't know if it holds up nowadays by today's standards but i used to love that when i was a sweaty teenager who just loves sniping in video games rachel weiss jude law ed what's his face [Music] and that other bloke from shakespeare yeah that's the cast of the movie [Music] great cast 10 out of 10. we're gonna drop another code in the chat here guys first come first serve [Music] david thank you for the 1k will this stream be available as a video later yes all of my vods will be every time i stream i'll post it as a vod ed harris that's it javier yeah i can't play with the m1 grand yeah i don't think i've unlocked it m1 garand you get a level six three line rifle we got a new patrol zone available does that come with the scope by default it does can i not just take the scope off i have to unlock that level 17 to take the scope off are you kidding i don't know about that patrol capture the objective time to get lean and mean time to get luna as the cockney's back he's back again egg tomo you're abusing your position here tomorrow for egg to you as well my friend i hope you're well you have the grease gun oh unlocked it is i've not unlocked anything guys i'm sorry this is four enemy at the gates here wow must've been on the radar joseph finds yeah that's the bloke from shakespeare see like i knew what they look like i just couldn't remember their names i do agree with you though tom egg yeah i i agree yeah i think at this time of the year like in this weather definitely egg mark in hostile locations ow patrol zone is out what did you shoot either then they have the patrols the rock disgusting gotta save ammo gotta hit my shots 10 bullets on this before you have to reload we got an empty patrol zone cockneys will be extinct in 20 years they all live in essex now you know as long as we remember them they'll never die they have the patrol zone that was me saving your ass ah went to the melee am i secretly working for the fbi what a strange question even if i was secretly working for the fbi i wouldn't tell you what i but no i'm not secretly working for the fbi are you maybe you are we got an empty patrol one shot is all i need i mean some of the voice lines are a bit cringe aren't there i feel like this is a good spot right now based on where the capture point is if i don't move though i'm to be on the radar is it going to come across there oh please gotta save ammo is that a transformer oh my god megan sounded a bit mark wahlberg there didn't it i think someone's outside here mean we have five points guys i it's not gone well this round you know we've not really been playing the objective or at least i haven't at least that's exactly what an fbi agent would say well we got eyes jack what's your favorite type of bust to ride on open top bendy coach or regular city bus i'd say regular city bus yeah definitely definitely my favorite you know you can't be too fancy with bus can you ultimately a bus is a bus right it gets you from a to b if it's too fancy then you're gonna start losing perspective you don't become relatable anymore yeah just the classic open top i don't know what this pistol is it looks like it's based off a luger doesn't it but it's fully automatic did the luger have a fully automatic mod in world war ii in real life maybe it did feral yeah you just have to deal with it it's fine control zone secured there are there are modern looking sites in the world what do you get here we're going to get some points here guys enemy has a counter recon aircraft oh no and they also have a tank by the sansa i mean what's that about we got an empty patrol zone bro this is not the luger it looks like a luger to me c96 there it is yeah the luger's got like a fat butt doesn't it you're right [Applause] behind me sdg seems op compared to the other guns yeah i think so i think the stg is going to be really good in war zone as well i think you want to just get an mp40 on this map don't you run around take the zone we're losing how does it run on pc oh really well it's really good patrol zones up for grabs luke is thick just got a big block that's all control zones [Applause] has been around since world war one there you go dropping some knowledge which i assume is correct and i'm just going to believe you because that's what i do it's open beta on the 18th chris so two days two for one mate control zone is ours yeah we got handbag again han solo's pistol yeah maybe yeah it's not a sniper map now i think you've got to you've got to level up your snipers first get really fast at speed on them because by default they're so slow tina thank you sending love from the us your videos help boost our fps confidence no problem tina thank you for becoming a member uh if you want to join the discord tina head over to jackfrags.com and there's instructions on there how to join it it's a perk of being a member just so you know oh my game just closed interesting i wonder if there was a update or something that was weird just closed no error or anything oh oh yeah oh we're back we're back in the game [Applause] it's quite loud that is isn't it mark wahlberg is a good actor okay i really like him in the departed i think he's very good i think it's just updating and restarting or something that's weird i'm just gonna let it do its thing yeah was it shaders what was it no idea has it changed my settings that [Music] i think so [Music] that's strange so we tried searching destroy not played that yet henry thank you for the one [Music] was it shaders i don't know [Music] did you pay overprice for your 3090 uh nvidia sent it to me intron why don't you have some cute kittens or something i don't really care about how my desktop looks to be honest it's just it's just another folder isn't it will it be good on a 1660 [Music] i think this game would run okay on a 1660 i mean it's not the best graphics card by today's standards can you make a room tour my room is just a desk and two computers and then that's it it used to be more elaborate than that but um i had like a load of white desk furniture in it i got sick one day and just tore it all down and uh since then i haven't replaced it so it's just an empty room with two with two computers two monitors and a desk it's really not that interesting leo for 1080p it should be fine yeah maybe have you heard about the 4090s mad i haven't heard anything about 4090s i don't know if nvidia would release another card though this year maybe next year what was the download size for the beta i think it's about 30 gig matthew barton there you go i run warzone on a 1660 and it's fine a super there you go do i use the 39 yeah i've got it in now kristoff i use it [Music] uh this is not finding a match is it search and destroy is basically counter-strike sir uh we're gonna drop another code in the chat here guys we'll do two actually we'll do two codes at once if you want early access to the base a big thanks to activision for hooking us up with those codes and therefore any platform you just put the code in you pick first come first serve super donut my name is jack 2 pog what's up super donut i think that found a match anti-aliasing arm two times i wonder if you're gonna be able to hear footsteps in this mode it's kind of important in smd yoshi's not in this game joseph unfortunately the objective use all your senses sight sound touch smell and gun i can't smell the game i can't it's not a scratch and sniff any of you guys old enough to remember scratch and sniff anyone watching remember scratch and sniff [Music] i feel like it lasted for a few years like it kind of outstayed its welcome is there a grease gun yeah have i ever been to denmark no i haven't larry this dude is hardcore defender come on bubba bubba's got that sdg attachment unlock what would call of duty smell like g-fuel enemies got the bomb see lots of people remember scratch and sniff i think we should bring it back do you remember as well those ink pens that you had when you were at school and they smell of different things like you could have a a a pen or when you write it smell like fruit it's not like a pear or an apple or an orange dude that was that was that's when you knew you'd made it at school oh man this this dude is cracked this dude is absolutely cracked out of his mind and he's called winton as well just wins everything uh chucky d thank you for the 18. beta is causing series to overheat all right that's a shame i hope they fix up stay critical of your opponents and yourself i mean the little destruction features like that's probably really good for smd i don't want to peek that because i'm dying enemy moving with the bomb it's interesting that you can like open that stuff don't know where that glass break was i bet there's someone just camping this lane isn't there 2v5 that's not good ah he was being the cool aid man i thought i was the only cool aid man obviously not guys got me next time i wish this game had a mode like ground war yeah it'd be cool alvin you never know it might do i mean they haven't revealed all the details about the game yet so maybe i love it because you know it's got tanks and planes in it so ground war with tanks it's already been done but with planes nah it's not been done throwing grenade incoming growing stun grenade watch it stand grenade is that guy still waiting for me yeah and that grenade didn't kill him cool bro these guys they're not bad players yeah i think ground war would be sweet under players world war two just make conquest might as well i mean ground wall was pretty much conquest wasn't it for this game as well they did 200 players at one point in ground war in warzone imagine this game with 200 players how sick would that be did i serve in the military no i didn't surround the objective and destroy it time to get lean and me did someone pick up the bomb or can anyone plump he's done grenade throwing grenade we've got a few more codes to give away huh and i've changed my load out here where's the one with the mp4a the sdg on [Music] i like you level up the guns really slow compared to modern warfare mexican food or italian oh giovanni that's tough you do you class pizza as italian food i i love mexican food [Music] i think if i had to choose if it was if there was a gun pointed at my head i'd go for mexican i just like the spice you know i like a bit of spice fullback clocked up what would be on it zack i mean [Music] ignacio sdg is getting the first nerf yeah everyone's using it hey best friends how is it it's cool it's good fun i mean beta obviously it's not finished full game's gonna have 20 maps apparently so that's the objective i'll say hope you like a little challenge the bomb is ours i think if you like modern warfare you'll like this game um but it plays a little bit differently to modern warfare like the guns don't quite feel the same the movement's a bit different if i got the bomb setting the bomb i plan here go and open the door activating the bomb the bomb is good to go it'll actually retain how much i i planted i'm being watched so i'm getting annihilated [Laughter] do i like hot sauce on pizza no i wouldn't put hot sauce on pizza there's no way there's definitely some improvements i think i'd make to this like the footsteps sounds could be way louder it's difficult i mean yeah i've only been playing a little bit already make a judgment on it yeah until it's out i mean you can get into the bomb site before they get there unless they just didn't rush them have i seen any hackers yet no i haven't christian hello craig much love from south africa what's up craig so i would put i would put pizza and mexican food they're equal to me like because there's some there's some times when you just get a nice hot pizza gooey cheese a bit of pepperoni maybe and it just hits the spot so right you know it's just as good as a nice bit of mexican food fajitas tacos the bomb is ours quesadilla burrito i love burritos burritos are overpowered whoever came up with a burrito was obviously like the best player in the game right they're playing the bomb there hey elite frostbite what's up the bomb is in place why am i shadow band on vanguard i don't know log maybe you just can't find a match i know some people were having difficulties finding a game mexican pizza that's the best of both worlds right there oh dear uh chad hey jack i really enjoyed your zero hour video and the shenanigans with the boys thank you chad yeah zero is a cool game it's a it's a small indie team that are making it but i think they're very passionate and hopefully they keep updating it and improving it was up isaac from another part of africa hey biggles i'm doing good thanks from canada eh joe remember when i said your stream always makes me hungry yeah you're gonna be hungry now for sure critical of your opponents and yourself the enemy has the bomb see i just ran into this room when i was attacking is no one else defending a no it's just me i don't open that door i guess i could can i copy this [Applause] i don't think it's gonna reach oh he finds nice line one doing a game zero hour maybe at some point in the future him ttk looks insanely fast yeah he's super quick uh new modes in this max are search and destroy i think there's one other i've just not played it yet champion hills in it what's up zero [Music] hey minnie mouse what's up breath of the wild 2 looks a lot different than the trailers uh this is a quad vanguard pioneer wrap it up do you like taco bell as well or only real mexican food i'll tell you what i've been to la a few times and the best mexican food i've had was from a a truck on the side of the road someone local who i was uh working with was like i'll take you to this place i remember what it was called it's just a food truck on the side of the road and it was delicious defend the objective use all your senses sight sound touch smell and gun i'm still trying to smell the game i can't there's nothing there's nothing there it's not it just smells like my office i mean i really want that perk that gives you the mw i feel like you need that there's one here somewhere [Music] did he kill my teammate grenade i'm a teammate running around but the war still rages it's just taco truck my daughter just got some snack scratch and sniff stickers yesterday they still doing man have they advanced has the technology advanced or is it still the same i think it's been about 20 years since i've tried one of those drawings i was looking at the wrong lane i needed to look further back there didn't i oh well what's up arvin from iran thank you gran turismo 2 smelled you could scratch the disc and it would smell like burnt rubber is that true really surely you wouldn't want to scratch the disc or do you mean the top side because if you scratch the bottom side of the disc then it wouldn't work do you think people did that i reckon that happened didn't it i reckon kids who got gran turismo too like oh mom dad watch it says that i can smell it if i scratch the disc it just like annihilated the back of the disc with a a pen or something or their nail i how did i have the most kills in that match on my team at least i felt like i played really bad then yeah that'd be funny actually i live for that oh we finally got level three the site compensator get yourself a constant tactical stock or how about the k90 outskirt 9x telescopic no i don't know you imagine putting a telescopic sight on an stg why are medium iron sights the last unlock does that make sense i don't why is that thing when a machine pissed or bitter nine i got the radar level seven uh we're gonna drop two more codes in chat here what map we got hotel royale oh which is better ice cream or cookies ice cream actually ice cream you can't keep asking me to compare these brilliant things i'm sorry it's just wrong hey paul don't ask that i mean that's i don't know team deathmatch i don't know do all threats win or lose that shit's on you soldier what would it smell like roses i don't think they'll be doing that chris salt now i haven't got a blind fire kelly yet oh that was my time in the sun and i failed ready for a big kobe here kill me [Applause] so i saw you oh i nearly used the destruction and got a kill guys nearly actually her footsteps oh so many there's like four people looking at me am i content with the number of toes i have yes i mean i wouldn't have a choice because that's you know if i was born with 10 toes i was born with 10 toes and that's all i'd know so i'd be fine with it oh this dude man this wheels guy with the mp40 second time he's done that to me what the bloody hell was that one okay fair enough yes revenge i'm gonna try and get a blind fire kill this match double kill why are you throwing grenades on me bro i don't throw grenades at you locations [Music] in the new call of duty you can be the dog johnny johnny johnny i just wanted to have a word with you johnny come on bro why didn't you want to speak to me i just wanted a nice chat [Music] [Applause] yeah i'd love to play some bigger maps you know i want to see what the bigger maps are like this one just gets a bit crazy can you slide yeah you can you can slide you can't really slide cancel though i thought originally you could but they've made it a bit different you can attack screen slide and then do the cancel but there's a little break it doesn't work the same way as it does in mw and warzone oh my god what the what the hell happened to you bro what was that i feel sorry for that guy i'm behind someone here i feel like i'm double kill yes i think i've got the last kill though i know please talk more german it's very funny nine even luke is that right probably not the mp4 is the best wait did i just hear a heartbeat sensor you guys hear that that was a that was a heartbeat sensor wasn't it is there something that makes that sound in the game what would make that sound i would like to unlock this please krausnik no i don't know maxim silencer oh baby a rat why is it called the rat level seven does that mean i can get that perk now radar the best perk in the game everyone's going to use it enemies appear on your minimap when they fire on silence weapon literally the best why would you not take that perk it's just clearly the best perk isn't it dr richtofen oh you mean from uh zombies yeah we've got 8 000 views guys that's crazy thank you for tuning in if you're enjoying the stream guys hit the like button thank you what's up hannah hello pam i unlocked a new weapon what did i unlock i didn't check thing is on this map you want the sdg don't you you want the sdj kind of looks like bruce willis a great name heartbeat is your heart close to death domination defend the objective is that true like a little challenge closing with charlie we hold charlie we have the lead i'm gonna be the first to die here they're taking baker hello yes closing with faker hero anybody here they're taking baker no that's the friendly up there oh death tone oh the phone i thought it said death toll that's the name of a band isn't it hello they're taking baker it's like a horror game now faker is overrun i should have waited until i had a nice clear line of sight on that guy guys it's the really really dumb idea to be playing the objective right here especially surely there's someone looking at me surely yeah ah i nearly had it as well oh no objective charlie i'm gonna go back there and go back enemy has a counter recon aircraft delayed instantly they're overpowering us take those positions he's right behind me oh he got all the points literally got all the points uh christoph thank you for becoming a member very kind we're dug in at charlie yes thought you could get away didn't you mate oh yeah i can't i just literally can't stop we're back here again i don't want to camp here sorry i did that already i'll jump out here and not die that guy just binked around like crazy you see that [Music] that's the death tone song isn't it shove it it's cold don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me i've become cod i'm one with the cod ready for report i am cod hide from this you donkeys i am card i am cod i am called i am the call of duty i have answered the call i've not answered the call of duty they turned me down i called him up i said guys i'm ready and they said don't think you're there yet mate i'm sorry you're gonna have to practice a bit more so i was disappointed but it is what it is you know they call the shots at the end of the day they decide who becomes cod and who doesn't this dude is sick [Applause] actually headshot me oh yeah closing with baker watch [Music] [Music] grenade come on don't go that way don't go that way no don't go left yes oh yeah literally every time i can't i literally can't not do it i mean they're taking charlie i have to charlie is lost i'm all right here's the hulk maybe maybe i am hulk maybe that's what it is round's almost over time for a comeback time for a comeback taking charlie i mean team we need to play the objectives are closing with charlie video my death tones they are playing on iceberg with shark circling a bit confused i know what you said there but i think i understand what you mean they're taking baker charlie is ours stun grenade out faker is lost why why did i get a hit marker then my teammate was down there i'm pretty sure that you can't get hit makes hit markers on teammates though maybe there was just an enemy in range of islam okay we'll get the a point no biggie securing able where's that come from closing with abel it's 1940 and americans are fighting russians yeah you coming for c capturing able lock down talking bacon you're hungry you just made bacon good for you todd i hope you enjoy is he still there on that angle they got me pinned all objectives secure tossing grenade losing objective maker which can't does the game mostly feel like black ops modern warfare world war two it mainly feels like modern warfare a little bit different taking baker modern warfare with a twist i would say how about that we've taken all objectives still got two codes as well to drop away in the chat they're taking baker grenade tossing grenade tossing stun grenade losing objective faker losing objective faker losing objective able their take in charlie is the combat real i don't know it could be losing objective baker you intel ready for report abel is lost charlie no we flipped it he went to charlie i think we're done for how big is the beta i think it's about 30 gig dead i don't know how big it is on console though maybe the same size i just downloaded it on pc so come on yeah we've not done bad here bringing this back or attempted to at least throwing grenade we dug in at charlie i do have two points right now which is good yeah it's early access at the moment um but the codes i've got two more codes using objective charlie they will give you access straight away we're losing c taking baker oh no why were you there i spawn on c okay baker is lost oh no [Applause] this is just the fight for b and c isn't it really this map i've got a whole bee it's really important you got to protect the bacon guys always protect the bacon securing baker what's baker not bacon i mean we can call it we can call it bacon chat that's fine can you still double jump no you can't double jump you don't have like a jet pack or anything like that they're taking charlie double they can see what we're losing rounds almost over say good night capturing charlie charlie losing objective faker faker is overrun i don't think we can do it guys i don't think we can pull back from this we tried our best maybe nice i don't think there's an objective pizza in the game no i mean i definitely secure it or if there was christoph let me tell you good genos that's some good players on that team if we play another champion hill i feel like it's um it's good i quite enjoy champion hill and get quite intense do you think the ability to change field of view breaks cod recall i mean it's an interesting question shadow because it looks different but it's not actually changing it like if you play on console with 80 fov and then you play on pc with 120 and you fire let's say an stg or a warzone weapon let's say the c-58 the actual statistics of the gun aren't changing but the perception of it does change but the biggest problem with fov for war zone at least because you can't change fov on console yet it looks like maybe they're going to include it with vanguard and with warzone on the new map the problem is that on pc you can see significantly more of the game and it's a it's a huge difference if you compare 80 fov to 120 it's a massive massive difference that's the biggest problem with it i don't think it's necessarily recall your team has a whole bunch of lives lose all your lives and you're eliminated greetings from cali what's up how's it going grab some gear at those buy stations let's start with a different weapon opponents to get more cash you know i feel like the mp4 is just really good though double time just maybe that and then upgrade the gun once who's my teammate who is it hey bands the footsteps in this game are like mice that are running around yeah i said that earlier like i wish the footsteps were a bit louder i think the game overall is a bit quiet and muffled you guys you guys get that do you get what i mean no it needs to be crisp i said this earlier it needs to be crisped up i need to put it in the oven for a bit welcome to champion hills and all other teams for the win grown grenade is that somewhere oh nice team i got the kill cheeky little upgrade there as well got 10 seconds yeah no dude i'm doing my kool-aid man thing come on i just want to be kool-aid guy well that was a good game i feel like my teammate is pretty decent as well i'm trying to get a drink of water yeah my teammate's pretty decent [Applause] passing scene grenade i couldn't figure out where i was being shot from there i've got a gaming thank you for the five good night from france you're one of the my best youtubers thank you girl it's very kindly they actually recorded real meister run around for the footsteps joseph is that right they got mickey mouse and minnie mouse in i don't know i don't want to run around for the footsteps anymore disney just punished me there you got 10 seconds that's it take their lives yeah i'm drinking water eric i mean we're in the league i felt like i died twice then i didn't need to i was looking at the chat i wasn't paying attention let's get that upgraded you guys are distracting me oh my goodness i just got beamed there sdj okay i need to pay attention otherwise my teammate's gonna be upset with me careful there you go oh this is a dirty angle look at this you could see me team fox was wrecked careful there you go under 10 lives left i think he's gone he's just better than mine he's already got the incendiary on it [Music] your life okay so that's the strat isn't it you buy the stg and you just let you just max it out and you get incendiary bullets that's it that's that's what you do although resupply i've only got 400 so i can't even afford the stg full armor i just accidentally upgraded my pistol i'm not even going to use that [Laughter] such an idiot 10 seconds on the clock i think we could pull this back are you an aussie no i'm british english lots of uh non-english people especially americans mistake the australian accent for english and vice versa it's weird because to me australian and english accents sound completely different like they are completely different to me but then again i am a native english speaker so [Music] one life left give it your all don't die bro [Applause] you got 10 seconds last one standing team's counting on you basically don't die enemy took your lives no money either oh this is going to be tough this is going to be real tough we have any lives left [Applause] team dogs seen better days four teams remaining oh no i'm done i mean really all we should be doing is just chilling oh i nearly died then get him get him nice okay good right okay now they've been eliminated can i get their guns nice okay free upgrades this is the incendiary no he hasn't got it that's it take their lives five hundred dollars i feel like no way and mixra are gonna be us there i will say nice there's a guy in there i'm worried about this oh god what about this right flank yeah i can't respawn now so this dude's trying to die the other team are going to push though because they know uh casimir thank you for the five nice try you can be the dog yes in this year's call of duty that's a good game you sometimes sound like you're from new york oscar really really really you think so rear grips opened up recoil control oh the sten beautiful sten i think we've got two more codes we're gonna drop them in the chat now it's quite insane how many levels and attachments are in this game i wonder how it's gonna translate to war zone johan they're all going to go in the game and you're going to be able to put 10 attachments on them that's what it's going to be you may have missed it earlier but there is actually a blueprint in the iron trials game mode of war zone that lets you put 10 attachments on you pick it up it's got 10 on it already oh this game's nearly over i want to use the stand this is your time to shine please let me use the stand oh baby beautiful stem [Applause] einstein's massive one i think if you went to new york and asked a local do you think this guy from england sounds like he's from new york they would go there's nowhere [Applause] [Applause] thank you for becoming a member it's very kind i'm receiving intelligence [Applause] i'm sure there was someone here is sweet oh yes [Applause] i'll go down there you intel ready for report oh there's another one on the right hey randy what's up christoph we are convoys today yeah we've been playing for a couple hours now call of duty in the new call of duty you can become the dog tristan dropping bombs there i wish it hadn't put me in this game which was nearly over it's kind of weird i'd rather just be putting a new game you know isn't that laura bailey that's doing her voice that character i think it is you owe me double kill i thought there's another one running there i've definitely reduced the damage as well the fall damage compared to cod uh modern warfare i know they have me pinned down comrade yeah put me in a new game please come back crush i was gonna crush me i wanted to crush me nice card piece nice arm nice approach nice par chip in chip in chip in i love we golf it was so good and i don't care how many tvs were smashed doesn't matter to me i played wii golf with my name and that's what was so good about it anyone could do it chip in nice double birdie how many codes i think that's it i think the code's all gone now ttk seems super quick i think they've um increased the ttk to be honest antics as in they've made it quicker um like when i played this last time i don't think it was it was this quick what's up evan team deathmatch changes this might be pretty good no no no kool-aid man kool-aid kool-aid kool-aid oh kool-aid's not going to be as good anymore it was all gone by the time i ran through it damn it i just want to be cool late guy everyone just holds me back you know i'm just trying to be me and then nope sorry ow i was looking at the chat hey not yeah double birdie's not a thing is it i just made that one up nice bogey nice double bogey approach boogie birdie it's not even a thing either just literally talking nonsense now [Music] ow you know i think one problem with this game is um the fact that you can unlock incendiary rounds on assault rifles i mean like isn't it just gonna get to a point where everyone has got incendiary rounds on the assault rifles like the stg and it's going to be aoe warfare where you just don't even need to like look at someone you can just shoot here if there's someone around that corner maybe are the incendiary rounds just in champion hill or can you unlock them i don't know i feel like if you can unlock them you know that's uh maybe gonna be a bit of an issue just trying to think about what that looks like when everyone's got everything unlocked no oh hit me in the head and again i missed but then the ttk with smg is like that that range is really really slow so who knows [Music] that guy's pretty good player he is relax you can unlock them okay yeah so that's i think that's going to be an issue obviously it depends on how good they are but they seem pretty good in um champion hill hi kang what's up how you doing i'm just holding that angle yeah oh this is the base i might yeah open beta starts on saturday i'm just getting absolutely chalked this much [Music] maybe not [Music] [Applause] as fast as mw i think i think it's a slower speed for that oh my goodness we actually won that match didn't feel like we were going to win it today he'd be proud today let's repair captain price or someone else i there's a heartbeat sensor again that must be a bug does that play the game really that's a full sbm lobby that is right there cool right um guys i'm gonna leave it there for tonight thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed it did we get a cheeky member there we did uh wyatt thank you very much how did the urukai even know what our menu is rodri that's the kind of question that i love to say you know on a thursday evening when i'm about finished on the stream someone comes in the chat
