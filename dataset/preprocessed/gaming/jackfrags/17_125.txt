watch this you know that phrase shoot yourself in the foot well i don't know why i found this funny in this game you can actually shoot yourself in the foot so i'm going to put a pole there i'm going to put paul there and then there's me hello lost cheeky wiggle oh loving that and then i can just literally shoot myself in the it's so stupid but i know maybe i should actually play the game just under two years ago i published a video on a game called split gate and back then i suggested it was as though portal and halo had a baby i stand by that but now after some time has passed that baby has grown up and it's starting to develop a bit of a personality of its own if this is the first time that you're seeing split gate the premise of the game is pretty simple it's a pvp shooter in which you're rewarded for smart play and accurate shots similar to halo what sets this apart though is the ability to place portals you can put down two portals at any one time and they link together not only that but you can go through the portals to get to another area of the map but you can look through them and shoot through them it's a bit of a weird concept to get behind but you can do some mad stuff every map has designated areas where portals can be placed and if you're clever enough with your placement it can make for some really cool gameplay moments so before we get into everything this game has to offer i have to say a big thanks to 1047 games for sponsoring this video split gate beta season 1 is available and free to play right now and you can check it out for yourself using my link down below now what i liked about the game a couple of years ago was just how satisfying it was and hopefully that's coming across in some of the crazy things that you can pull off in the clips that you're seeing here you've got to remember that the new halo wasn't around when we first tried this game so to get a halo esque game especially on pc that felt very satisfying was quite unexpected for me it wasn't perfect though the gameplay itself was great in my opinion and the gunplay was solid but visually it wasn't really pushing any boundaries gameplay is the most important thing after all fast forward to today and i feel that the game has taken a big step forward with the recent updates and it's heading in a good direction so what's new well right now the game is on pc xbox and playstation and as i mentioned it's free with the first season we get a host of changes and additions first of all every game modes evolution and capture the flag there's a completely reimagined foregone destruction level new features enhancements and even a custom map editor it's nice to have that feature as you can imagine there's also a battle pass too which we'll talk about in good time i mentioned a few new game modes there capture the flag and evolution capture the flag well that should be fairly self-explanatory as it's a pretty common mode in arena shooters but there is a slight difference in split gate it's round based with teams altering attack and defend this means that you've got to focus entirely on defending and or attacking which is a different flow to how capture the flag usually works the flag carrier is unable to use any weapons when transporting the flag and it does take the defending team a small amount of time to return it it's a fun little mode that definitely rewards team play and then we've got evolution which is also a round based mode it's a 3v3 game mode where the team that loses around gets improved weaponry for the next one both teams start with only pistols and then you gradually get better guns if you lose around the first round that you lose grants you a battle carbine then it's a battle rifle and a plasma gun and you get the picture it's an interesting take and it means that for a team to win overall they've got to really outgunner team with worst weapons the maps are a little bit smaller than some of the other ones as it's only 3v3 but that also means that you need to play smart if you want to win especially if you've got worst weaponry the foreground destruction map has had a big overhaul this season and it really sets the tone for the game moving forward the quality level of the map has taken a massive jump and while the overall layout has remained the same the assets and texture detail have improved significantly what's more is that now i'd hope that this is going to be a good gauge of what future maps will look like other maps will receive the same visual overhaul in future updates too now this update also brings with it a map editor which will be music to my ears and all of those budding map makers out there a long time ago people honed their map making skills in games like quake and unreal tournament and while this map editor isn't quite the desktop version of what we had back then it's still got a bunch of functionality you can add in any of the standard blocks of which there are a lot as well as objective elements weapons and of course the portal walls these are arguably the most important because positioning these well around your maps is what will make them flow it's another big factor to consider thankfully the editor features a fully customizable controller and mouse and keyboard support so it can be accessed by all players on any platform it's got some nice features here too such as easy rotation and magnetic snapping to make placing objects a lot more straightforward i had a play around with it found it very easy to use the way that the editor works means that you can jump in and out of playing in real time too which will definitely help with testing and we mentioned the battle pass earlier and it wouldn't be a new season of any game without some form of battle pass would it the past has 100 levels for you to blast your way through and the rewards include new characters banners and sprays some of the player models are also very unique and some of the milestones here do feature paid content as well for fans who want to spend money on cosmetic items if you want to level up quicker there are daily missions and weekly missions that grant you various xp boosts and you'll need to be level 10 for the weekly missions i have to admit that while i haven't played split gate all that much over the past couple years it's been a lot of fun to get back into it i spent quite a few hours playing games back to back and even went back to it over the next few days because i just had a bit of a desire to play it shotguns and snipers and the swap modes are incredibly satisfying and of course reminiscent of old-school halo and just landing consecutive headshots on enemies never gets old if you want to give the game a go i think now's a good time because there's plenty to work towards and there's lots of game modes to try out and if you're not satisfied with any of the maps well you can always have a crack at making your own and that's all for today
