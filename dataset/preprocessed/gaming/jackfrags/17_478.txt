welcome back to destiny 2. it's been a hot minute since i last played this game in fact it was september 2018 the last time that i touched it and what you're seeing here is gameplay on a next gen console playstation 5 at 4k 60 frames per second and as you can see i think it's looking really good on next-gen and the console players can finally get an fov slider on the next-gen consoles which i think is just a absolute necessity for fps games nowadays and something else that we've talked about recently the crucible which is the pvp mode you've got the option there to go 120 fps if you like i don't really play the pvp but for those that do it's cool to have that feature now so today we'll be looking at the new paid dlc called beyond light before we get into the details i have to say a big thank you to bungie for sponsoring this video the standard edition of the new dlc will be 25 off on pc and playstation all the way up to the 5th of january and if you're interested in checking that out for yourself there's a link down in the description below so what is beyond light then well i thought that i could use this as a good jumping back in point for destiny 2 because i think that a lot of this is aimed at new players completely new players or players that stop playing like i did and want to jump back in and try the game out again so there's a revamped starting area although it is in the cosmodrome which if any of you guys played destiny 1 you'll know that was the starting area of that game but they've changed it up a bit made it a bit more beginner friendly i would say but the meat and bones of what we're looking at today is the beyond light dlc and this is a new chapter in the story i suppose which marks a new trilogy for the game i feel like they're wiping the slate clean in a lot of respects and it comes with a brand new story campaign and a new planet europa which you've been seeing in this video it's an arctic tundra and it comes with a new strike which we'll look at in the next video a new raid and loads of new activities at the time of making this video i haven't quite got the correct level to do the raid but it might be something that we look into in the future if i can get a good team together because if you've played any of the destiny raids you know how tricky they can be and you really need a decent team who are geared up and communicative and just know what they're doing generally so i might do some coverage of the raid in the future we'll see now this mission i'd say is about halfway through the story campaign and we've been tasked to go into this underground installation and take out a guy called praxis and steal a shard of darkness from him and this all relates to the new power in the game which they're calling stasis it's essentially ice it's ice powers and much more involved with crowd control rather than directly attacking people because when you get this power you can throw these sick ice axes around everywhere that ricochet but you can also throw grenades down that turn the enemies into ice and also create a physical barrier against them and this level in particular really caught my eye and i wanted to show it in this video because this place just looks awesome in destiny 2 there's some gorgeous environments and it's so full of detail and they look like vast places that you can just get lost in and you feel that sense of scale you feel small as you're exploring these environments in terms of my character i did have my guardian from pc because the game's got crosstalk now but i wanted to experience it as a new player so i just made a new hunter and as you can see i've gone down the void subclass just because the void blades are so cool mincing through all the mobs here never gets old but it is kind of neat though if you have an older character and you haven't played for a while if you want that back you can import it and keep playing from there regarding the minute to minute gameplay it's not really changed that much since i went away and stopped playing destiny is and always will be a looter shooter where the ultimate goal is to level up your character improve your stats by doing the story doing the strikes doing the patrols getting your stats up as much as possible to eventually have a crack at completing the raid with your friends and the raid is usually the most exciting and interesting content from whatever is the latest dlc and as i said i haven't done the raid yet so i can't comment on it and i didn't want to spoil myself but from the initial impressions that i've read and seen online it does appear to be quite fun and also not bad for beginners either so i'm looking forward to doing it but like i said in terms of the core gameplay it's very similar to that initial destiny 2 experience but keep in mind that they have removed a lot of older content from the game too so not everything that was playable before will be available now this area is super cool going up all the different levels love a bit of verticality in my gameplay and you got to watch out for those mines as well i also like swords the purple sword's so good you can just do the normal light attack with r1 but if you press r2 it does a swirly whirly aoe attack that's just uh pretty devastating and here's my potato console controller aim in action for you guys to see i do want to play more on console though next year just so i can try and get better with controller i used to be pretty decent but i just barely play on controller anymore so time has taken its toll and this is the boss room dude flies in here like green goblin check this out there he is the absolute mad lad praxis opened up with a grenade just trying to hit him in the head as many times as possible there and he's got this huge flat cannon thing but he also spawns a load of ads and he throws ice bombs at you or stasis bombs i suppose they are and if you get caught in them you have to break free and pop the super day just to get as much damage as i could and he's got immune that's the first stage of the boss finishing off the ads there i couldn't figure out what to do here i was like how am i gonna defeat this guy every time i shoot him he's not taking any damage and then i found these things in the sky and these are his portable shield generators and on the first stage there's only two of them just take those out and then you can start damaging them again more sword action here that's the swirly whirly that i was talking about so satisfying you can't play through the story with friends as well have to dodge out the way there but tommy and bonk who i played the strikes with for the next video they'd already played through the story i didn't want to bother them so i did do it solo you can do it solo if you want it's a bit tricky though i have to admit during the story i came up on a couple of bosses that i died on where they didn't have respawns i just had to keep doing them that's the the freeze there mr freeze but there's a few more stages where he spawns the shield generators and you have to keep taking them out and then at the end you get the stasis power and it regenerates your super really quick so you can just keep using that new power throwing ice axes at this dude it's a bit of a grind but eventually we take him out there it is mission complete i'll get the shard of darkness there and as i said this is kind of halfway through the story i didn't want to put any cutscenes or really spoil anything major so i left it out but there it is that's an initial dipping my toe back into destiny 2. what do you guys think let me know have you played the recent update and what did you think about it let me know down in the comments below once again a massive thanks to
