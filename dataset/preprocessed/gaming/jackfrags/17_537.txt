hi everyone and welcome to the call of duty warzone halloween event this went live a couple hours ago i haven't played it yet so this is gonna be some fun for us all i'm really looking forward to it they've got a zombie mode they've got a nighttime version of the map in the zombie mode you can play as the zombies so that's gonna get pretty uh pretty crazy i think i'm really looking forward to it they've also added a load of new like cosmetic stuffs different skins as you can see i am billy i think he's called billy the puppet from saw that's the character that i've gone with but there's a load of other stuff too you've got leatherface from the texas chainsaw massacre oh man it's uh it's a bit crazy but i'm gonna play as billy i reckon there was another operator they added was it yeah this dude so i think this guy is a or he was a zombies character is that right guys dr karloff but that guy's got a couple of really awesome looking weapon skins but they put those three in and there's a couple gun skins as well like this one is the jigsaw one the gallo and he's also got a shotgun and then the texas chainsaw massacre guy leatherface has got one for the fin lmg which is like a chainsaw there's a couple of different charms and this knife as well flambotamist apparently that's the jigsaw knife and you throw that at someone and it drills into them and just splats out a load of blood so you know maybe we can uh test that tonight give that a run for its money oh yeah check out this ak as well this is the dr carlov ak where is it i might not use this one in warzone though because aks just aren't very good in warzone but i have to say that it looks awesome right check this out this what is that kind of looks like a sci-fi gun doesn't it that's cool and the last thing i wanted to show you guys is the the leather face horn right the squealer okay listen to this you're gonna love this [Music] so i've put that on all of my vehicles and whenever i'm in a vehicle i'm gonna be using that and squealing everywhere but if you do pick anything up in the cod store use my code which is jack frags and all caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that with that said we are going to jump into the first match now the haunting of the dunks i thought i'd show you this too apparently there's 16 things that you can get and if you get them all you get this uh pumpkin gun the pumpkin punisher but you can find these in crates around the level and some of the crates give you jump scares and apparently there are ghosts running around and hands coming out of the ground and all sorts but like i said i haven't played today so let's get into it i'm gonna be playing with tommy and bong from the two angry gamers here i'm gonna unmute and we'll get into a game are we back in the room and we're back in the room with jack frags right so do you want to play zombie royale first i think that might be the one yeah i'm just putting my chainsaw going on that i got a chainsaw yeah oh did you get leatherface another boy yeah i'm just trying to see what else i got i got some stuff for it but i bought it and i actually don't know what i bought okay i bought something like oh there's a pig squealer yeah i got the big spoon i got the squealer did you get you got both of them did you the content yeah i bought both of them numbers three actually well what's the third what did you buy there was a like a weird doctor guy from cod zombies no one really knows who that is players do no he's not from films zombies players what um well i can't even see what i got because once you bought it it's gone oh how do you equip a melee weapon that's what i want to do you have to take overkill off hey i haven't got overkill on what means how do you customize it onto your loadout you should just be able to do it then and there have you seen the um sorry i don't understand what you mean by that in there so on the loadout yeah you where do you select a custom melee skin uh as your secondary weapon ppg oh yeah yeah the um the doctor guy has got a mp7 that fires like electricity and vaporizes people well i've got a gun that fires chainsaw loads that's not true is it well i don't know jack that's what it says it says legendary dismemberment yeah i mean it does dismember them yeah but it doesn't fire chainsaw blades but it says it's fine as chainsaw blades well that's a lie well it suggests it fires chainsaw blades let's just try it out and see what happens yeah you apologize to finnty first change something i feel like you can't not be a horror guy at this point i'm a whole lot you need to speak doctor electric or whatever doctor electrically 16 pounds 79 and then you can have an electric mp5 that vaporizes people it sounds right up your street doesn't it it does yeah electric mp7 i think you're quite enjoying the skin actually as well actually probably is the best of those three skins yeah i am come on donate 16 pounds now and then you can feel better oh dude leatherface looks sick he's in the map somewhere nice there are ghosts and zombie hands and and pools of blood well i was watching people stream this earlier a little bit do you fair the skins for dr carlov are really cool they're like um district 13 district 9 sorry um yeah the ak well you get for the doctor this one's got a skull on it it's kind of horror pong you buy the electric man it's fine that's ghost listen let's just get into a game i'm not happy about this zombies night mode go i go bomb oh look at my red crocs do you like them i've just noticed um all right edit loadout there you go all right who's who's leader bonk am i yeah zombie royale bong let's go okay got it zombies can collect antivirals from dead players if they want to redeploy as a human yeah so you can become zombies when they die zombies take more damage from headshots they're live last team with human winds what's he gonna have a zombie on your teams yeah you could have a zombie friend the two of you could be zombies we won't stand for this no i wouldn't stop it i want dr carlov as the third so i want the full horror team there'll be plenty of horror i want to see what this um his skins are these guns are actually really cool here we go second chance humans become zombies alive zombies take more damage from headshots i'm looking forward to this ascot do you think it's a jump scare if you told us there's a jump scare well you don't know the jump scares coming dude i just love how people are going by the way guys this jump scares when you do this yeah great you've ruined the surprise thanks what do you want me to say for that well it's a chance of a jump scare it's not always a jump scare but why even tell me you know [ __ ] twitter i've got to be the first one to tell you sir it was me either me like what what why what's up duff hey dragon boss serena what's up guys yeah so this will be our first game no lewis this is war zone zombies hey jethro good for you man i hope you enjoy this i'm looking forward to it should we go for a couple hours right here we go here we go so a lot of the map has already gone i am a leather face that looks so weird i like it these kids are going to be in like somebody playing with this in like february yeah trick or treat well yeah that's true trick or treat locations let's go down here apparently farmland or uh prison is quite cool tv station that i'm going to i'm going to i don't know i don't know yeah go on then zombies are more powerful in the gas what yes zombies yeah gas zombies apparently uh should we go up and do the that scav up there yeah yeah yeah yeah there's people fighting this is like have they changed the droplet i don't know maybe since season six yeah i don't know when the last time you played was adam what did i do over here overhead on the tv station yeah i mean i'm in the tv station though he's peeking at me well unfortunately our box is in there so our box yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i'm in here still on the roof oh he's in here it's really low guys i know my right that's it yeah you're going to be a zombie huh can we have a look at you when you come down oh i'm going straight for this guy don't you worry somebody's just endlessly responding hello guys that's it hang on is that an enemy zombie there i don't know no next why do i stay there and then oh no no no no you should come back as a zombie no if he dies zombie you're out i'm gonna get one chance as a zombie guys one chance as a zombie i'll see if i can sell this could zombies buy back as a zombie i don't know i think i think so yeah now you just crunch the flower i can't load either of your guys you can emp blast and you can also throw a gas grenade a charged jump what is this get an antiviral one you need one more then two months so you have a melee attack what the charity zombie viral whoa bong's what does the emp bus do i'm guessing it slows people i mean they're not all robots so that's a bit weird isn't it can you get the do the mission still done i'm gonna try no no but don't go to the zomjack and do the mission there's two there's two virals on the roof like that it's like um they're hidden isn't it yeah look at that last time he was like trying to tell his mates to save him when i was smalling him there's one you've got a radar by the way as a zombie you've got a uav currently where are these vials they're down one they're down one jack primary objective accomplished yeah you just get a massive uav there's two coming in there's two people coming in i mean i don't they must be down another level it says down there on the on the map yeah they're on this gas feet oh there's one i've just killed a zombie and got a self-revived kit that's back in as well yeah so i'll come back and revive me guys you've got a lot of money adam yeah it knocks out people's scopes apparently well you don't really need thermal or night vision yeah it's day doesn't really mean this doesn't look that much different to normal to be honest no yeah what are you kidding it's completely different well it's not yeah but it's not like the pitch black knight is it you know yeah you can see invisibility it is a bit of a hit though [Music] oh this is the all right whole team armor on your armor's on i'm just running away adam i've got nothing no left anyway you could uh summon me back in quickly i know you're gone right you kiss it wrong go on throw it into it right there that's it we won't see you weapon is awful right so i'm going to be zombie again now i think why are you zombie oh because you got you managed to come back yeah hey it brought me back with my guns that's weird but if i do an emp blast here i've just come a little frankenstein i'll just kill the other one oh [ __ ] down nice are you both i killed one there's a vial down there down the down the guy there as well guys jump back on them if you come back on the bone there's a guy down you could gobble him i'm not gonna resupply read it respawn sorry where was he once just zombie here that's your friend though right i mean you can't damage him nice i mean how is he not dead all that money might be on the floor still i'm coming back to the top of the player okay i mean we need whatever gun i've got is bad you know yeah hello now so terrible he's bad you know i mean i need to go get a better gun oh god zombie oh no oh that almost goes pretty cool i need this stuff i need another zombie there's a minute as well you've got enough cash now to respawn i'm trying to get munitions should we go should we go and get jack back from there come here give me give me your money jack any money i mean give me money all right let's go back let's get him back from here look oh yeah self revive as well self revive kit you got it thank you very much regain their humanity good good time for the lmg look at this chainsaw oh look at the beam this is the electro gun look at that horrible i've got a hammer to beat up zombies and melee with you get a lot of money in this game mode yeah i'm gonna put this munitions box hey where do you want to go then i mean we've got to stay in the zone watch out for the zombies i'm sticking to this chainsaw in the meat grinder go for that loadout over there see if we can get ghosts and stuff oh that's a good idea well we just got i've already got my i just got that on mine yeah i suppose cold blooded is probably better for this move i've got cold blooded and ghost we've got a um and i've got the footprint tracks thing but basically um what's his name from siege i could go for his sniper rifle i kind of want this meat grinder to meet up matched up zombies you know i'm just thinking if you've got ghosts does it take you off the zombie radar let me get rid of the um what is that guys group behind us look at the edge of the circle um three two three seven do you want to try and get them yeah let's go [Applause] what the hell the bottomist yeah that's the knife if you hit that into someone it like drills into them let's see it's horrible i don't know if the uav is is that pinking zombies hang on what the hell like yeah it's over this way look yeah i see a guy what the hell that does sound awesome like yeah i'll meet on me okay whereabouts is it just on the corner of the building yeah we're catching up i'm gonna peek oh [ __ ] did i meet in the building oh my god i didn't even get a chance to [ __ ] shotgun just ruined me i'm gonna get the antivirals off these guys and come back in there's a sniper jack yeah he's here there's two teams pushing me that's really difficult to see when you shoot i killed one you get the sniper yeah i got the sniper antivirus this guy in the building in the building in the building i'm really low he's pretty smart for me though yeah he needs to get him to get his money he's just in that building on the a guy a zombie in there alive we can get the train at him if you want just attack the zombie a bit he's in the building the room to the left in that building he just goes together oh i've been asleep how do you get back up here oh what i've been on the roof on the roof because he's the same guy like he's just been sat there now he's done this two different guys have got me pinned down just one guy in the wrong guarantees that's that's fun oh yeah there's more in there still we might be able to get on the roof don't respawn now because they just run down and got the virals there's a guy down here in the corner let's get out up here oh there's two on the roof over there on the card yeah we're okay in the gas i've got to 200 to be able to uh respawn you need to run the gas is coming sure that's it love this i'd love to see this that's rude oh no no no i'm okay though you can stay in there i'm not affected by the gas you run faster in the gas station there's a massive jump coming in here big jump no just too slow jump off go down careful out of the gas nice you'll come back as a zombie one more time but you're definitely gonna get gassed up you might have a bit of cash though apparently the emp disables vehicles let's just get people out of vehicles oh no it's time to gobble your last gobble isn't it well zombies just come down and go yeah i think the i i think the old jump gas grenade and gobble is the only way isn't it yeah the gas grenades really strong the only way you're getting any oh just go for antivirals there's two on the map to your left there are people in that building [Applause] [Music] yeah yes you press yes what no you just click leave with buying is what you click well that was a fun first game wasn't it guys what do you think in the chat it's uh it's quite different isn't it really it's really different than typical normal war zone we've got some new members sebastian thank you screaming eagle i appreciate that jackson thank you so much for becoming members i appreciate that what's up pablo hey jake yeah i mean first impressions is pretty fun i think we need to learn the meta of it though it seems like it's three punches to take someone down was that a turkey james yeah bong and tommy are very good at doing uh voice impressions what are the trick-or-treat spots mitchell apparently at various locations there are boxes just the normal crates and you open them and you can get like scares out of them or you can get halloween treats like custom charms and things like that so i've not seen any of those yet we didn't really do much looting in that first game though we just kept on dying over and over again use cold-blooded i don't know how effective it's going to be in this to be honest what's up natalo ali ethan thank you for coming guys super hard being a zombie i think so yeah but if you work with your team i think you can do it you like the crazy gameplay damien hey kieran factory and s thank you for becoming a member do you like this little graphic that i've had made as well my mate taisel made this very talented artist and we've got a little uh graphic here for my code i might make that a little bit smaller though that's a little pumpkin shrink it down a bit i don't want it to be too intrusive put it down like that different locations i mean that's spooky isn't it zombie it's got the word bone in it all right i think we go to the boneyard this round oh it's a shame the prisoner's not in zombies we'll go there when it's in a damn apparently it's quite cool what's wrong with the boneyard why don't you like my boneyard it's a bit messy in it no that's exactly what you want you want meds you want dogs what do you want why do you start with the spotless scope of this [Music] i this because maybe they think it's pitch black or something pop the zombies okay so that crate just popped open candy nice i want that oh let's see so we can get a trick or a treat yeah and there are 16 unlocks as well that you can get i'm going to get here's my nearest i think i've got a rocket launcher and that's it i've only got an sks oh it's dead nice let's head towards bong that's what yeah my guns are terrible right now yeah well i need to hit him with one rocket it's all over isn't it i hear a zombie careful that's fine yeah here attacked him a bit we got rocket launchers the zombies like that or i don't think zombies like rocket launchers no they're perfect a zombie's going to come for us uh let's go go left go north west nice i just think someone's gun cold hold cash right we can go and get a load out now pick a tray what'd you get i don't know uh let's go to this buy down here guys oh charm unlocked it's lovely well what about oh you got one did you yeah wait there's the yeah let's get loaded out first and then we'll go for the bounty all right yeah jack's got 20 grand what the hell let's get that from jack look out alone win this hill a small loan of a million dollars a million dollars the bounties to our left but yeah let's get the load out yes million dollars ah it's zombie time it's just around the corner oh i'm coming back where oh for god's sake i'm dead as well i don't know what's going on there i think i've had someone oh no right in the back different squad i think yeah i got runes you guys got zombie time that's all good well i do i wouldn't do that oh no nice one more there's a bottle there yeah got it it seems like you're invincible when you do that oh what i'm moving back because i i i think that's true i thought that was you yeah now i i ran past them as well and i genuinely thought it was you i was like what what and then everyone else like what typically are you kidding me ruined you can can you play this solo i think so yeah but you have to do phil as far as i know it's a trio's only unfortunately there's no there's no quads i feel like they should have gone with quads for this but didn't for some reason i don't know big tay you just had a 38 kill zombie game that's insane dude that is absolutely insane they should have added a special ability to be brutus the doom dlc has got sharks is that right [Music] yeah i do maternal new dlc came out today didn't it i need to get on that oh my goodness that is horrifying well the problem is i am dave if you continuously respawn the game would just be chaos wouldn't it they have to add a bit of strategy to i suppose your teammate has been marked as a high value target keep them protected all right tommy's going to try and uh get this i think might be difficult though three minutes you're too scared to try this game mode emily just give it a shot it's not that scary although you do have to watch out for the crates that you open that i've jumped scares in i've not had one yet dragon boss yeah i want to go over to farmland i want to go to farmland and damn because apparently there's stuff there what's the spook level spook level's pretty high ollie i'm not gonna lie hey sergeant is the normal battle royale also night yeah you can also play normal battle royale at night time yeah there's someone in the building let's see what happens oh no it's jigsaw oh dear gg that was horrible they just shot you twice that was it yeah well first of all he came in and then he went up what was that what just slid off there is it revenge simon revenge no come on yeah he's the same guy he hit him three times he just hit me you just hit me three times that was it what the [ __ ] i i didn't hear a thing on that guy coming down the thing by the way he just literally landed and that was it that's all i heard oh yeah the sounds sadly still ruiner of games is that stupid hospital as well i don't know hey malvin what's up when's the event until i think it's on until november the 3rd or something like that it's it's on for a while what's up numbers uh brendan thank you for becoming a member it's really kind here do you know anything about plunder llama no i don't know anything about plunder jigsaw is open unfortunately it doesn't have the jigsaw voice know that you want to play a game like that that kind of thing i reckon i could get a setting for my go xlr which made me sound like the jigsaw guy the saw guy vincent you had a jumpscare crate and you pooped yourself a little well that's no good is it the zombie's got more health than humans paladin i think they've got less to be honest we've had less health it's quite spooky isn't it hospital is really scary because there's ghosts child voices and jump scares jackie hello sorry i was gonna vaporize people kinda you can with the electric gun yeah well can you please do that this game oh if i can get a kill with it yeah well we need to uh apparently hospital is cool it's got like spooky noises and ghosts and like little things running around you take us wherever you want jack okay david it's not dlc no it's just a free update for the game at ubc thank you for becoming a member how many wins no wins on this yet shifty we've only played two matches going to the ball what apply time's over check some of it isn't even in the server

don't really play much warzone that's why the comms are a bit weird like they just they just say whatever they could you know whatever comes to their mind so that's it's quite different experience to playing with like uh acolyte or study or westie or whoever but it does ramp the intensity up i'm not you know i'm not gonna lie it gets a bit chaotic
