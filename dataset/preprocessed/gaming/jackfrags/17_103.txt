oh my god welcome back to bf1 guys i thought this would be a good video to come back to today i know i haven't posted for a few days now what is going on here but i've just been really busy with real life stuff and boring stuff like doing taxes and accounts and v80 blah blah blah you don't want to hear that but i've also been playing the hell out of elden ring and of course that's a good thing because i think it's a excellent game but it's really really bad for my health and also my productivity because i am obsessed with it i'm addicted to it and i've actually considered uninstalling it because the amount of time that i'm putting into it and it's that kind of game where you just you keep playing and playing and playing because you think you can beat the boss i want news for you you can't but what i love about it is that it's an open world game that doesn't hold your hand at all it just points you in the general direction goes you know what that's roughly where you should be headed and in between you and where you've got to go there's going to be some nasty big enemies i'll be shot from the left oh i'm dead you know go and farm them for a bit come back later and maybe you can progress but yeah i'm just hooked on it and my productivity is uh massively decreased i've been recording everything though with eldon rings so i'm probably going to end up doing a couple of videos on it where is this as all play again it's just i don't know when that's gonna be i mean i did post a clip up on my clips channel earlier today but in terms of like four videos i need to figure out exactly what they're gonna be like i was thinking maybe something where i just show you my experience of beating all the bosses or the coolest moments in the game i think that could work quite well and to actually focus on the game here don't i we are losing objectives there'll be a guy right behind this wall here like here thank god for the minimap well thank god for whoever put that flare in the air but i've got the hell regal today just for old times sake you know i was looking through the list of weapons and i thought you know what there was a point in time where everyone used the hell regal and let's let's try and bring that back today and of course i've got my dynamite too if i need to use it oh that might just got wasted with a shotgun there was it 60 rounds in the mag god hello i didn't really play this map that much come out though really good for infantry yes i swear that things just explode randomly when you shoot them in this game was it because you can shoot the grenades it's something like that and actually get down here and get a bit of a glitch here or maybe a flank goodbye my god there's so many you kind of got a burst don't you with the assault rifles i wanted to talk about star wars as well now i have talked about star wars a lot on this channel before but i don't know if you guys have heard of the the star wars hotel they've just opened in orlando florida which uh oh my god i'm dead slide away well they weren't friends with mickey mouse obviously but of course a disney owned star wars now and they've built a star wars hotel and uh i think it's opening officially next week but over the last couple days they had press and content creators in there doing previews and reviews of it all and it's just it's crazy i think if you're a star wars fan or a kid you'd probably love it but i think if you're not a star wars fan you might look at it and go this is weird and awkward and i would never ever want to do this because it's almost like live action role play i guess i'm not going to go into every detail but the theme of it is that you go on board a spaceship called the halcyon which is a star cruiser and you go on a cruise in space so there's no windows in the whole thing it's all themed as if you're actually like on a star wars ship well there are windows but the windows are all screens of space and there are actually characters who talk to you and interact with you and they give you quests and there's a whole storyline going on and it only lasts for two nights i think it is but it costs six thousand dollars to do it's it's an insane price but i kind of feel like it would be a bucket list you know for me one day to go and do it because it just looks insane and really unique and they've got themed food there it's as if all the foods from the star wars universe and themed drinks and you can do lightsaber training you can fix the engineering on the ship you can go on the bridge and shoot the lasers and then have interactions with droids chewbacca c-3po r2d2 yeah if you're interested in it look it up and let me know what you think down in the comments below oh right now i just lost that guy completely the tracking was off can we get d though or someone just took a shot of me then didn't they friendly yeah friendly oh my god that scared the hell out of me i couldn't see the green thing maybe i'm colorblind i can't be because i wouldn't have known that was green would i messygamer mike that's a big name isn't it someone just launched a gas grenade there oh there's a sniper right there yes that's how you shoot the thing kind of do little bursts it seems great in it it's just good fun sniper up there hang on what if i where are they up there oh we got a hit i think it was just the explosion yeah kill assist from hitting that shack there or whatever it was oh my god you're right there what the hell i think maybe a bolt action rifle or something would be better on this map because you've got all these head glitches and you can kind of hop in and out if you know what i mean i'm gonna get shot inside here try not to get this little flank here come on where'd you go ow sword off shotgun to the face that's the infiltrator isn't it one of the special units that you can get i wonder if they should have done the specialist in 2042 like that where you still got classes but on the battlefield are like packs and you pick up the pack and you just become sundance for like as long as you live or something like that i don't know would have been an interesting take on it yeah i was gonna say they should be right there surely i don't know maybe if they did that they'd have the same problem that they had in battlefront one do you remember where everyone just camped their hero tokens or whatever they were we'll see interesting discussion either way could have been an idea they were highly unlikely to come back from this now because of how the system in conquest works on this game apparently there's a load of people on d here i guess over there no we're capturing it back now oh where'd you come from rust you're friendly the uniforms look so similar don't they on this map i'm so in the open now but i don't care look at this flag oh we can make this work we can make this work oh my god watch out i'll just go prone here's how many kills i can get there's only 50 tickets left there's two what if we go around that way instead around the back this way there's a little flank here look at this oh stolen oh what are you doing that's my tactic oh god i'm scared i'm scared anti-tank grenade i think we lost uh i couldn't get the spawn in there come on gg that's fun always good fun to come back to bf1 i hope you enjoyed the video today guys thank you for
