can you even do a c4 jeep in this game i think i've ever done it before no i was gonna use that and you just take it right now that's not cool well now you're dead those are mine on the road this man needs some assistance well i guess we'll never know if the c4g works hi folks and welcome to some bf5 live gameplay commentary today we're playing on hamada and we're going to be chatting about battlefield 2042 just fancy playing some bf5 today it's been over a month about six weeks i think since my last video i just get the urge sometimes you know really like the gun play in this game i think they nailed it and the movement very good let me show in the back charges put from there just in case they follow me yeah i think i covered most of the latest 2042 news more information in those last two videos that i did you know the one with the um portal behind the scenes presentation we got this guy is not gonna die and then the interview that i did with the devs but there's been a few additional details i guess that um have come out there because there were other developers that were interviewed and they told people different things you know maybe i didn't ask the right questions or [Music] perhaps they uh just wanted to get different information out there but i'm in danger one of the biggest things i suppose that's come out of this yesterday i saw a twitter post about how the band list is going to work i'm so dead yeah there we go up on the hill map 38 i've not seen that in a while yeah so the band list is going to be tied to your account if you make a server and this was a big problem with bf5 because you could make a server and let's say a cheater join the server or you just want to kick someone because they're being toxic whatever you banned them you kicked them banned them if you then made another server they wouldn't be banned from it so they could just rejoin any servant that you made and of course that's uh it's a bit of a problem isn't it i'm just hiding here i can hear them all around me oh one in the knife kill turned around i feel like i should just leave this area but the way it's gonna work with portal is if you make a server there's a guy here yeah and another one dead if you make your own server and you ban someone they're going to be permanently banned on any servers that you make going forward in the future which is great you know if you put together a a sick game mode or like a server rotation or something that people really enjoy come on there we go and you bounce someone for choosing they're not going to be able to rejoin any other servers that you make i think that's good and there is going to be some admin control as well i did mention that briefly in my video they didn't go into too much detail about what that admin control is but it should be kickband that kind of thing server messages there'll be loads more than i imagine so but that's all they said on that for now jameis what are you doing okay mrs got his big gun he's firing away he's living the dream potential i want to get this d point here it looks equal at the moment [Music] planes just crashed into the ground there are multiple people there you push it oh my back 40 in the back that sucks yeah i'm just i'm really enjoying battlefield right now you know going back playing all the other games i think the best thing right now is just um the vibe in the community you know it's uh it's quite positive it's been a while really since i feel like the whole community is really wanting this game and it's brought a lot of old fans back to and that's great you're trying to destroy that building there's no one in there mate it's gone that little sniper there i can't do the artillery it's too low try again okay maybe oh okay that spitfire just did the job for me [Applause] spitfire brought their own artillery can i use my arms i can use it now dice come on that's weird you don't usually get two voice notifications like that yeah i think people just want to see some like uncut gameplay show people what you know what the minute to minute gun fights are like and stuff right here [Music] i do not want to let go of this dave one been a good fight so far this [Applause] is damn it good there nice choice i think the beauty of portal as well is that it's gonna be really good for the competitive scene for bf 2042. so i know battlefields never really had a massive esports scene i suppose although you know i'd say in bf3 and bf4 it was the biggest but since then the community's not really have the tools to make something that's consistent or easy to put together but now they do they're still around the back here what the hell so that part of the community will return everyone's going to be able to make their own server have their own rules and i suppose people can decide collectively what bf 2042 is as a competitive game what are the rules what's allowed what's not allowed and it's going to make a return which is kind of exciting oh my god what is happening here planes coming in i mean this is battlefield right here okay buddy i mean imagine a 64 versus 64 competitive match like two clans versus each other being spectated and commentated on all those vehicles all those players might last like 40 minutes or something oh got it didn't really need that dynamite but that could be so awesome to watch so many possibilities like that's that's what's really exciting me the most maybe it's just 5v5 maybe it's the acv32 i don't know if we can just figure out what's best they did take d backward oh my god i go i'm flying good oh that's a butt yes i got the res robin thank you so much so many explosions love it look how pathetic this machine gun is i was trying to shoot the grenade there but uh stand firm defend the bloody objective cool little trick you can do might as well spend these points as well oh my goodness that's the longest drop shot you've ever seen squad needs an air striker i think there's a guy there too oh okay i didn't get any kills with that rocket dude this gun is an absolute laser there's nothing worse than seeing fortification destroyed when you call in a rocket and spend all your points it's like the worst thing ever it is what it is cool i think that's about the end of the round there unfortunately we lost this one but i mean we had some cool moments in there didn't we thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed that always good fun coming back to bf5 let me know your thoughts down in the comments below leave a like if you liked it dislike if you didn't subscribe if you're not
