[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to dying light this is part three thank you for all coming along yesterday it got pretty real there were plenty of betrayals plenty of zombie kills all sorts of parkour shenanigans and i'm really looking forward to continuing the story and where we left it off was we went to the top of the big water tower we liberated it and then we decided to not kill was it joe and jack and we're gonna try and help him get out of the city instead our next objective on the main quest is to go and search barney's apartment i think it's over there somewhere i think it's that place isn't it i don't like this area of the map though because it's got all this weird yellow stuff but since i played yesterday i have actually done a couple of quests or side quests i suppose and got some upgrades i've got this purple weapon look at this bad boy and i've put fire and electric on it and that's my first purple weapon so i'm looking forward to trying that out today seeing how good it is oh he's doing a cheeky little inspect there also i've got this that's not i didn't mean for it to go there hold on can i pick it back up guys i can't pick it back up i was just trying to throw it down there hold on okay you didn't you didn't hear that did you maybe you did i just wanna i just wanna test hey look at that oh oh are you guys coming up here okay maybe maybe this wasn't such a good idea let me just get back to the safe area back over here everything's fine now you may have noticed already today we are actually playing and streaming in 4k 60fps so the stream it's gonna look crisp it's gonna look good and this is all thanks to nvidia a big thanks to them for sponsoring the stream today it's really great to work with those guys again this game dying light 2 supports ray tracing and nvidia dlss and that's stuff like global illumination shadows ambient occlusion we'd like the ray tracing and we're going to just take a look at that in the options menu here so as you can see we are playing at 4k and we've got dlss mode and essentially that just like boosts your frame rate but allows you to use like other graphics settings that you might not be able to use if you're playing at the native resolution so if i just do a quick demonstration here if you look in the top right hand corner at the moment we're on 60 fps with dlss turned on i have capped the game to 60 here as well and that's because of the capture card otherwise we get screen tearing but if i actually go ahead and turn this off no upscaling so we're going to be at native resolution now the frame rate drops to like 40 42 and you guys can probably see on the stream that that doesn't look quite as smooth but i'm going to go ahead and turn that back on and we should jump back up to 60 constant look in the top right and there it is so we've got like a constant 60 fps um and the reason i've capped it is because if i don't cap it we get screen tearing and nobody wants screen terrain on the stream do they um also if we just take a look at the ray tray settings here we've got ray traced shadows so that looks great for stuff like the foliage on the ground we've got ambient occlusion so that just means that everything in the scene just feels right and also global illumination this makes a massive difference in this game the way the the light shines instead of like fake light sources you've got real light sources uh digital foundry did a great video on that if you're interested in checking that out some more but a big thanks again to nvidia for sponsoring this one i'm looking forward to it okay we need to head over here [Music] just a one-hit kill is it okay fair enough that purple weapon's actually pretty decent leasing con yeah vsyncs on if i don't turn the sync on we get tearing because there's no um hdmi 2.1 capture cards yet so we're stuck at 60. but that'll change in the future i think i can climb up there and go across that bridge and then on the zip line this is what i took about three minutes to figure out yesterday you guys in chat were killing me no can we here we go i didn't want to go right there i did not want to go right go across the zip line [Music] check out the apartment oh f4 weapon inspect now po that's not true is it that's not true i've got a lock picker it's an easy boy though this one i mean said easy took me about five attempts to actually find a thing oh god is this a trap [Music] guys i don't like this i'm sure that i already checked this didn't i unless they've like refilled it or something [Music] oh yeah i've also got the raytrace flashlight on but for some reason in this game they didn't have like dynamic shadows with it which is kind of sad that's something working there evidence oh my god i'm gonna have to go rummaging through his bed oh this place is a pigsty horrible it's like my bedroom when i was like 13 14. i'm gonna help what the hell look at the ceiling it's covered in christmas lights is this some kind of collector or what he collects the crystals so we can make the lightsabers we've already established this haven't we yeah it's gross that ain't no proof [Music] i mean do you think the proof is going to be coming here oh great and someone's coming my way cool get out of there now why i can fight oh god isn't that the tattoo that that come on what that's the tattoo that the commander was no here's something that's skin that's horrible that's actually disgusting hey what the hell oh [ __ ] that's that's human skin hatch i found the tattoo they cut out of lucas damn freaks what yeah oh i'm gonna throw up get the hell out of there we still ain't doing why are you going through my sister's stuff no no i didn't know they were hiring pilgrims as housekeepers i told didn't i say yesterday i'd kill this guy barney what the [ __ ] is we did a little piece of lucas to remember him by you sicko i'm gonna kill him so hard [ __ ] you nice try but that ain't mine i'll kill you you son of a people [Music] we'll see i mean that's not really killing him is it stop it what's going on here for [ __ ] sake are you nuts he's he's setting us up [ __ ] pilgrim is framing us and that's not true what is he talking about aidan i found the proof hidden among your things proof of what you cut the tattoo from commander lucas's arm after his death or when he was still alive well like in your mind i didn't do it maybe you didn't with your crazy brother barney's not a psycho we have nothing to do with lucas's death i'm going to ader i've got the proof he's looking for aidan it's not us nobody at the bazaar will believe you [Music] chelsea you can't get this game on the snares unfortunately eat the skin i'm not gonna eat the skin then where did this piece of skin come from sophie could have been planted to set us up ever think of that who would do that and why to distract everyone from the real killer who gained the most from they are lying to me who had the most to gain if it was that easy for you to get in here then someone else could have come in here before you and planted that that's ridiculous doesn't matter this is between you and aydah now wait please aidor doesn't care about the truth he doesn't care about finding the real killer he's only looking for a reason to raid the bazaar it's not my war sophie no but you'll have blood in your hands blood of innocence someone is setting us up someone clever john don't believe it sadist who would skin lucas aiden and you know it but i know that you want to get rid of the pks yes and we will get rid of them but not like psychos and assassins aiden believe me this is a setup i'll help you get to the center i promise how by getting rid of the biggest problem of this land the pks that seems dangerous we've been preparing for this for a long time i'll tell you everything when i'm ready stay close to your radio aiden time to make some changes around here well the pks are basically the army or the police so i don't know how we're gonna do that so [Music] check frequency 72.5 fm 72.5 fm for all your zombie needs is there nothing in here yeah it's very strange of things isn't it [Music] so do i just go do my thing now i have to wait for them yeah i did actually see that coming up in the game there's a section where you're in a big city area it might be that bit over there and you get like gliders and stuff you can actually glide around i don't know how that's gonna work i presume there'll be some kind of like mechanism to boost you into the air so you can glide around wait for sophie's call i presume that i just have to sleep then to get that i don't know where should we go jack and joe's bandit camp is that a safe house there yeah i did a couple windmills as well off stream too i can hear the people no don't jump up there jack you idiot oh parkour hello yeah i got this as well heavy attack so now i can whack people really hard sleek runner increase your speed while never getting tricky obstacles temporarily increases your movement speed which allows you to jump across wider gaps far jump tap e while running over an obstacle oh man i feel like that's the one right like a wider gap that's more rewarding surely getting ridiculous in a good way conrado yeah for sure okay let's get down from here i don't want to go down there remember i fell down there didn't i not for me [Music] what's up there [Music] oh my god i'm swinging around like an idiot i jump on this it should fall down sick stay calm [Music] this thing is mad it's purple the best rarity of the game guys you know what can you get like gold or something or diamond rarity i'll try this heavy attack oh that feels good good body red nasty [Music] bit of a wind up though isn't it i feel like you only want to do that like human enemies when they're staggered that's sick gold okay so you can get gold then interesting come on aiden hold up there like a baby what the hell a kick up here i learned how to use these as well orange so there's orange and gold just orange [Music] i've got 99 bedtime [Music] see if she calls me [Music] bryce i'm addicted to this game so fun it is pretty fun yeah i'm enjoying it wait until the morning [Music] charles you're almost at the ending already really [Music] i saw like some full walkthroughs on youtube and if you just do main quests you can do it in like 12 hours but i think if you go for like side missions and stuff you'll end up with about 50. why won't the lady call me follow the checkpoints to finish the line as quickly as possible where's the bazaar the bazaar's over there i did have a couple side quests as well actually this one [Music] who removed his biomarker just to see what would happen what happened eat veggie don't say don't kill zombies eat veggie oh yeah because they're eating people now aren't they and the pets as well i heard some lady earlier say people used to have dogs and cats as pets and didn't eat them how weird so you have a laugh i mean memorial at the intersection of houndfield avenue and mill street okay we'll go back to the water container you just coughed on me why would you do [Music] that this is a nighttime name here [Music] please not like this how do i do that extra speed boost then didn't say shift or something [Music] well maybe i shouldn't do that that often unless i really need it [Music] nolan north again no it's not nolan north it's a guy called jonah scott i think jonas something it might be jonah scott say something like that please correct me chap what's the guy's name who does the voice of aiden this is madness sophie the peacekeepers have more weapons men they will crush us like worms ato may have more men but we have the home field advantage home field advantage you're crazy i forbid it while i leave the bazaar no one will attack the peacekeepers you no longer lead the bazaar what you're no leader call denounces us we lost people because of you crystals tell them sophie you almost got yourself killed tell them my mother wanted a free bazaar not slaves serving the peacekeepers i want to restore peace here you can help me with this or leave roger humphrey arrest them no what are you doing they want to betray the bazaar roger roger you have no power anymore carl you want to be like your mother you'll have blood on your hands sophie a lot of blood get out get him out carl is right we don't stand a chance in open battle sophie what the therefore we're gonna weaken them first what do you mean we'll cut off their main source of electricity without uv lamps adore can't defend his base they will be driven from the metro tunnels and cut off from the armory how does all this get me to the central loop once aider is weakened he will retreat for reinforcements then you can make it to the central loop aiden but first we have to blow up the windmill and fast before aider gets wind of what we're planning we're gonna blow it up barney gather our people be ready no roger and humphrey go to the armory provide westbrook it's gonna be awesome capable of fighting and you aiden go to alberto and vincenzo they'll walk you through this gonna be a hot war here community and freedom aiden together we will win kind of sad that i used two of my c4s i suppose i could craft some more though oh he just gave me some okay right what's going down boys we have a lot of our dust hey alberto tell me the pun this new armor of yours is flimsy more fit for a beetle than people can i wear that yeah way too thin first time peter shares a great protection this is top craftsmanship made from the finest quality materials built from uh oh i can almost see the steam pouring from his ears look out he's gonna blow titanium we reinforce the armor with titanium we pull from the scrapyard that's why they're lighter and better protection you guys shouldn't be such dicks well why didn't he just say so we'll see we'll see about that thanks vincenzo you didn't have to it was nothing that ah as for you those two oafs took the last titanium vests i'm not here for armor sophie sent me you're supposed to bring me in on some plan the plan my plan carla creed call agreed you hear that vincenzo not carl sophie you gonna share or do i have to guess windmill we take down the windmill bingo the big windmill that provides power to the pk headquarters but first we need the charges that jack and joe left at the water tower don't i have those would you bring them to us pilgrim after we blow it up all the uv lamps in the pk headquarters will go out that'll allow the infected to attack them old villa door will be free again and you you [Music] have a clear route to uh uh you know the plus chemical fallout well and what's it called a central loop the central loop right how do you know the pk will withdraw and not retaliate because dad designed this windmill he knows it like the back of his hand and it's the pk base's only power source it does sound like gru doesn't he risk us we said that yesterday but we must act fast before the peacekeepers catch wind of our plans so you win all right fine i'm i'll do it okay go to the water tower we're going to use the charges that jack and joe tried to blow it up with let me know once you get there what are you waiting for this i [Music] i don't think they got michael scott to do the voice no no i don't think it was him has he ever done voice acting for a game [Music] [Music] bye oh that was close titan thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly it's locked at 60 tony yeah if i unlocked it we'd be getting about like 70 to 80. because you don't understand me because you don't understand it sounded a bit like queen is about that dude i was trying to test the speed boost thing because you don't understand it charles god [ __ ] what happened here been destroyed [Music] hey let me in lady what happened oh my god i thought you were a zombie i'm i'm such an idiot [Music] what's going on here pks they've been searching us for weapons despicable me games and outlaw volleyball everyone in sight looks like someone set us up who and where are the bombs for alberto we managed to send some out the couriers last reported near star square then silence ma you keep saying that i'm going down a dark path supporting sophie but i don't i'm going to the stars how would you know that was their last check-in are you just judging her character oh my exactly ada yeah be careful someone [Music] is it barney the dinosaur do you think it's in here guys [Music] yes [Music] i bet i had fun making these zombie noises in there [ __ ] that was some fight pk's ambushed your transport he searched everyone and everything eventually they found the bomb someone tipped them off they took everything to know suddenly something scared them off and what where are the charges hey um they were in the yard come on maybe they didn't steal all of them lucky for you the infected showed up how's this guy is dead i missed hold on there's another one can i like kick them into this i don't like the fast boys there's three i suppose i don't have to stay and fight me once again so what's this oh no it's a tapper you kidding this one i'm gonna drop kick one of these guys in the face watch this which one hey oh okay they attack upwards as well [Music] ah i didn't realize that was a power attack i'm sorry dad what if i can i get them to come over here i've got a plan i've got a plan no why were there additional zombies i didn't ask for this it's the wrong way okay come here come here guys just if you could kindly you could just there we go i feel like that was a lot of damage yeah yeah yeah [Music] oh that's an aoe horrible i do want to kill these guys though because it's going to be good xp i i suppose that i could just like search this stuff and disappear if i wanted to but now i've done so much damage to them i might as well stay [Music] can we stop can we stop that please yay oh my god look he's glitching out what down i need to crash some meds okay we'll craft some meds and then we'll go kill the big guys maybe i could have kicked him into that as well that's like an electric box so it looks broken already is there one more over here big guy what are you doing back there some of that this as well oh this had him that's the guy how do i feel after this shout out from the two times you mean doctor disrespect when he's watched a few of my videos and stuff yeah it's cool hey check out what's up yes oh my god that was close [Music] okay good i think that's all the big ones dead now we can just like search in peace that was three of them wasn't it was that three i think so everyone's dead they're all dead dave take that like that take that you guys know can i kick the big guys and make them stumble or is that like an ability that i'll learn later on because i feel like if i tried to kick one of those big guys now it wouldn't do anything like it wouldn't stagger them [Music] i'm just not strong enough alberto i think wonderful excellent so what are you waiting for oh no i'm trying to grab onto that there's some weird lines in the sky then king luke i like your hunt showdown videos thank you oh you just got it as well nice yeah hunt showdown is a great game [Music] it's quite difficult to get into though but once you learn it it's amazing i thought there might be a pad down there i could jump on aim for that nuts floppy sword i don't i don't know if that's a thing [Music] [Music] military convoy where there's no one here what check if you do exclamation mark setup for exclamation mark specs or pcs that's the link to where i've got my pc but that will show you all my specs and stuff it's a 30 90 and a 12 900k it's pretty much top of the top of the line top spec as as good as you can get at the moment i don't know intel are bringing out a 1200k s soon which is like uh highly overclocked version of the cpu that i have it's like cherry pick silicon [Music] i don't think i'm going to get that i don't see the point i've already got this overclocked and then there's a 30 90 ti coming out [Music] that's supposed to be out this month i think but there's some rumors it's been delayed to march so we'll see i could get faster ram my rams 5 200 megahertz i've seen some 6400 kits but i'm gonna wait until there's a good ddr5 kit with like low latency across the board rather than just buying a fast one now ddr5 is gonna improve only two [Music] pk's took the rest i got some damn damn it tripled them because of that traitor our plan is in danger we must act quickly no nitrates we need fertilizer then we can make more explosives the old night runners they've got everything and certainly all we'll need to make more pops i know a guy lives on a rooftop friend not foe it depends kilian you know him hakon's friend killian kill him yes kill you i'll explain how to i remember another way thanks oh diablo all the blizzard games just they roll into one for me or is it killian murphy or cillian murphy depend on how you pronounce it [Music] you want to see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids dmca i want to get a drop kick or a jump attack i think that's next you know in the combat skills that's really going to start sealing the deal for me this chap lives on a rooftop does he like most people in this world apparently [Music] what speeds my internet one gig florida i have one gig up one gig down why am i crouching well why not climb up that did this yesterday didn't i i've learned you there killing it don't think anyone's there there's no way in on the roof [Music] a window open maybe killian killian it's aiden ethan i don't think he's there man that was weird and pick this one first time oh first time big am i gonna play elden ring yeah hey matt you put the stream on your tv awesome hopefully it looks good search for the fertilizer there's gonna be an air in it back then everyone must have thought bf bingo alberto fertilizer fertilizer i i can barely hear you they're ready no make sure that fertilizer gets to my dad okay i'll do my best is crew gonna die i feel like gru's gonna die it smells delicious i've not played the first one benji i only played it for about an hour so i didn't i can't really compare it to the first you have to do it without me join my dad i'll be on the radio the whole time me and your dad i think that's a good idea we have no choice aiden it's the main group can do it together okay [Music] that's the first time i've died from before he always wanted to do something big that's exactly what i'm afraid of i'll stay with you on the radio hello vincenzo hello no guns i think there are guns animal but they're really rare i don't know what do you guys think after like you know i presume that some of you guys have played this or you've been watching me the last couple days do you think the first one or the second one looks better so far i'm the wrong person to ask for that because i don't have the experience of the first game i did try and roll on that jump that i died but i think i was just far too high the chance i can't hear you [Applause] what what do i have to do i think we can do this [Music] dice fbi open up oh groot's fine i brought the fertilizer you sure you got this of course i'm sure and if i don't know something i can ask vincenzo just tubbo the windmill's causing too much interference radio doesn't work ah and you're certain he explained everything to me relax we'll do me and you will do no reason we won't do just fine like i said easy as i bet it's a really good laughing co-op the bombs are ready you're up take the charges planting bombs what could go wrong ray tracing on yeah yeah right yes precisely thank you zaramaxus yeah i mean i try and pride myself on the the quality of the the stream i don't think many people are actually streaming in 4k 60 on youtube and if they do they might have like screen tearing or the quality won't be great but yeah this is 4k 60 40 000 bit rate i mean it should be one of the best looking streams on youtube i paid a lot of money for a dedicated leased internet line as well so i've got like continuous upload speed one gig up so it never drops frames or anything i can swim in this game oh yeah of course i can i was swimming in the first like 20 minutes i just haven't swung since then swamp swamp which one is it deals with these damn renegades don't want my name ending up renegade oh god i could do i could try and do this stealthy couldn't i i quit the knives if i craft a few more 22 in total geez what's that immunity booster regen booster decoy confuse enemies [Music] oh there's a crate here [Music] really oh it was right at the top oh no okay a little bit to the side this way [Music] that was a bit tricky oh baby so i checked my inventory let's see if i've got any upgrades on the clothes because you your clothes actually affect your your score like you're you're scoring this game it's your gear score essentially so you can give yourself you know buffs and different stats and stuff joggers for a ranger you see there are classes but they're not like defined classes parkour combat and healing [Music] i've got some sneakers what about weapons did i get any new weapons 30 damage oh that one's got two slots as well damn oh baby let's power like gold in this game yeah i think so gotta put that carl weasel through the ringer he'd spit out him i got a body stop stop murdering that guy he's my friend the fire wouldn't let me dodge maybe i should stop crouching like an idiot how about that [Music] how do you like the pk now let's block it [Music] sometimes the attacks are quite difficult to dodge didn't get my hair off in time i thought there was just one guy there in the fireplace sneaky takedown nope was just a guy there right next to me try that again [Music] you see me already are you kidding okay [Music] hmm [Music] something tells me that's [ __ ] up sorry what it's through a coin mate i don't know what the deal is he's okay my friend is damn okay what the hell is that [Music] you done okay it's much easier when you do it stealthy it'd be interesting if you could do that like if you stagger them yeah i was thinking like do a stagger and then use them as a springboard and then kick them in the head is that possible that'd be funny that's probably possible isn't it no in this game [Music] there we go [Music] [Music] how much room there is there swing across [Music] nobody around jack craves violence don't we all really look into yourself see what's inside [Music] there's no peace only war that's humans [Music] okay big climb up here [Music] doesn't really use much stamina this hey b was it mazami is the cop experience like borderlands easy take on same missions and progress together i think so yeah [Music] i hope that they haven't done it where it's like only the host gets the progress because that would suck if they have does anyone know did i have some bugs yet i've had one game breaking bug where i got stuck underneath the table and i had to reload my save but that's it the whole time i've played i've only had that one i know apparently some people have had it a lot worse than that though so but that's my experience my experience has been uh pretty pretty bug-free and there's a few like basic bugs like people glitching through walls and you know brag dolls kind of messing up you kidding [Music] but no i've only had one game breaking bug only the host really tyler if that's true that sucks molotov [Music] can i do anything with that there's a big zip line here is there really only three guards there come on is that is that a zip line a bait sorry do you have to like jump onto the top or something i just feel like i got your bed you just watched me die didn't you is he asleep it's only the host explosions are in place yeah that sucks if that's true time for the fireworks everyone progresses so this contradicting opinions in chat i could have jumped in the war would you like the honors no you do it i know how much this means to you can you jump in the water yeah i guess maybe the dark knight moment isn't it heath ledger isn't triggering must be interference from the wind there we go uh it doesn't look like it did much the windmill's still standing look wait for it wait for it vincenzo's calculations no they must be off you kidding i don't have to go back in there fixed in a flash gotta see this through now i'm thinking mobile this is being played native today yesterday was g-force now this is native what are you doing an armed bomb before the pk's get here giving you an armed um everyone progresses but the host is the only one that makes the decisions on the story okay that makes sense maybe rely on radio detonation they get to knock with all the interference what now this one is guaranteed to blow up the whole it's a big bomb all right how much time do i have let me count oh you get a parachute later as well where am i supposed to put it where you have to go back and and plant it on tell me where put it on uh leave it by the base of the windmill no that will accomplish nothing right in the middle of the windmill i can finish my own sentences thank you very much on the road you have to climb up to the rotor to the very top you serious the bombs [Music] you really think we have time i mean for jokes what i think if you wanted to blow up a windmill like this you could just you would just put it at the base [Music] two minutes [Music] dice [Music] yeah it's just a minstrel is it okay [Music] the little beep reminds me of counter strike it's the same beep isn't it c4 [Music] um [Music] i just jump up in jump on that [Music] oh this is good this is so funny faster go on [Music] i love stock yeah that's it [Music] guys there's a ladder here did you see the ladder did you guys see the ladder before [Music] did you see did you guys see that ladder guys there's no ladder i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to use the windmill i'm gonna have to climb up guys [Music] yeah okay we've got 25 seconds i don't know if we can do it what do you think guys 18 seconds 15 seconds 10 seconds [Music] eight seconds five seconds we did it guys [Music] roundup round of applause everybody round of applause in chat it literally took us 10 minutes sorry what what hello hello hey alberto we did it guys i'm just gonna edit that part out of the stream when it's a video your sons are [ __ ] oh no what have you done to him are they taking him away what the what the basket my boy oh no no that's what i call a boom i got my boom i kind of feel bad for now you you you got them pretty good now we we got him good without you the windmill would still be standing almost like the fireworks in 1990 [Music] uh [Music] and you'll just keep getting older quit the [ __ ] aiden i'm not that adult [Music] and now it's asking me for a birthday for helping me [Music] i know what they think of me of course i know [Music] tell everyone it's supposed to be such a dramatic moment and all i can think of is that they changed the ladder wasn't yellow okay [Music] nice thanks to you alberto no thanks to a vincenzo okay they laugh at him laugh because of me but now that we've done this they won't laugh anymore he's dead because jack took so long he's his old man's mans not a cook or a failure anymore force the peacekeepers to withdraw saying it was him promise me all right okay oh and tell him it's all the ladders for tell him that i love him that's okay i'll tell him that i'm proud today today i'm proud never told him that son i am proud of you [Music] i'll tell them for you i promise those bastards they got him oh thank you for the upgrade sorry you died [Music] in stamina we are getting more stamina it's all about stamina now from now on stamina stamina stamina stamina stamina doesn't have a head i hope he gets a good burial cover him in flour that's what they do let's get flour hey hayden nice fireworks show you put on now it's time to blow this popsicle stand i can't one thing i still have to take care of you don't get it there's no time to waste we can make our way to the center now everyone's too busy to know this i promised alberto i'd tell his son something for him do you want to finish your business or play shepard spreading the good word well it's bad news hack han lou here he's not looting though but the metro is empty there might never be another chance like this are you sure i have to go find vincenzo icon i promise i was a at their place when you're done if you're still alive i am going to die yeah you can't leave him guys i just had to check [Music] no [Music] i don't think i've actually triggered a

listen there's another way through an old tunnel under the hills near the tango motel it was used by smugglers peacekeepers didn't even know about it it's been closed for years but if you manage to start the generators you might be able to get to the center you're telling me this just now sorry adam i want to help you but most of all i have to help the bazaar good luck pilgrim i'm cold yeah he

nuclear guys i mean i'll go nuclear if you want i don't care [Music] that's sick that's the first time i've actually used that skill [Music] [Music] i just want to check yeah i knew there'd be something i could search here excuse me while i just fell everything give it a massage oh yeah um there's gotta be a rock or something i can climb up or [Music] get around that way that way there it is there it is there it is [Music] nice [Music] you there yeah kind of bit busy just letting you know we've detected movement among the pk's they're looking joking take care and good luck there's no gravity in this game it doesn't exist [Music] yes yoga flavor tunnel this could be the place hekan talked about but no sign of waltz that was fun i enjoyed that [Music] there's things in there but that door doesn't open hey [Music] oh it's electrified [Music] run into it and die [Music] this one [Music] i don't like that [Music] kind of makes out like you can't walk on this but you can there's some unusual messaging in this game i'll say that why do i have a random waypoint there what the hell i'm gonna have to turn the power on damn it maybe there's some kind of generator around here it's back here guys [Music] the case we can open this [Music] 2.5 less earth what gravity than earth in this game [Music] that one was tricky [Music] you kidding [Music] i thought it was gonna like let me get through that after i'd been there [Music] it's gonna be a big blood okay it's gonna open up that and then i can go through what the hell is that is it an incendiary zombie just what i needed um [Music] just like three undodgeable attacks interesting there was some stuff in here wasn't there vodka surprise one of these i'm going to open up and there'll be a jump scare it was a game actually wasn't there oh what was that game do you remember that game where you only had melee weapons and it was like set in new york maybe and it was a horror game and you played as a detective and like people with melee weapons would come and attack you and you had to solve a crime or something and look for clues and then there was like a bit with mannequins and then there was a bit of a locker where you open it up and it's like one of the best jump scares in video games what was that game called you guys must know you know what i'm talking about like 10 years ago maybe it was really good though it's quite short but it was really good [Music] someone in chat's gonna know what i'm talking about condemned yes slippery rogers you got it papa tran bambi behind door what a great game what a game you don't call you don't write and it was such a promising friendship waltz ordered lucas's death detective adam won't rest until he solves the case you expect me to believe you why would i because waltz is here hang on boys search the tunnel why would wolves have lucas killed to weaken the pks to put a wedge between you spread chaos i don't know his plans i [ __ ] hate politics and i'm gonna work the wrong side what else is there to discuss they're attacking the headquarters they took the metro station what the [ __ ] [Music] come on grab that door this gun did it this stream is going to get dominated as well man i warned you later there it is the electricity's off we need to find the fuse box what's going on here who turned it off who do you think you're gonna be a smart arse now i'm just saying let's get him well you can't escape anyway may i helped you don't screw me search for the fuse box there should be a utility room nearby hepa check the other entrance you two search that tunnel it's a maze but if waltz is hiding here he had to leave a trail like any slug a slug i think that's one of the best insults for someone isn't it have you ever called someone a slug in real life as an insult mate you are such a slug yeah condemned criminal origins it was a great game and it did have guns in it as well but like you barely ever got ammo for it no power i just haven't i just turned no i haven't turned the power on let's go down now nice that's a dead end yeah i thought it was [Music] someone said call of duty someone said quake uh no it's locked what do we do aidan what are we gonna do [Music] that was locked before and now it's suddenly open peppa do you have anything there are some wires but it's all flooded this doesn't look good lieutenant the equipment's been shut down for 15 years keep looking hopefully that's not the reason for the short circuit keep looking oh yeah lithium is maximus hang on before i go in there i'm just going to do this spring out the water like a dolphin someone was here they yanked out the cord no cigarettes [Music] house back on take that oh there's bloody footprints you just spider sensation that's it that's it whoever could get past that must have been pretty limber all right speak for yourself someone must have locked that door i'm gonna have to swim i hate swimming sections in video games almost as much as i hate ladders you know you know there's me making assumptions about game design again [Music] get in there hey somebody's in here it's him get him easy now surround him hold on just give me a second while i just loot this there we go jumpscare i'm waiting for it it's gonna come [Music] you're gonna pay for lucas is that bloke wolf still on jack matt's leash this is the main bad guy save it for your trial just before they cut your head off do you really think that's how this is going to play out lieutenant lucas's death was just the beginning you admit you hadn't killed take him no he's gonna snap there's no way why does his death bother you look at him he's got like voices he's all juiced up new status new challenges new possibilities don't i deserve a thank you for making this possible dog no i still don't believe his lies now enough of your crap coffee pepper i'm glad you finally joined us shut up now give back what you stole from me give back the key boy or you will all die [ __ ] peppa what are you waiting for i knew it [Applause] he's got the zombie strap he is the one beginning to believe you can pay for what you've done [Music] a little boy wants to pretend he's a grown-up but he's no grown-up just a precious little boy hand like this you're dead then are you you probably died from not in real life for me no not like this not like this yeah fear was great series i've talked about it in many videos before uncle fungus i wish they'd do a reboot of it an actual decent one this one's dead he crowned pain over there someone's moving boss is in the factory there's something weird about him oh my zombie am i zombie now i mean i've always been a zombie [Music] i knew it was something like that why can't you just rip them in half can i play the whole game like that that'd be great please oh what the hell i could do the voice for this what's happening to me what happened here where are you i'm in the car factory what says the gre key what's that dramatic dramatic cut for you [Music] can i play please just play the whole game like that [Music] [Music] can i get the flying thing now give me the flying thing you're a zombie [Music] yeah but that was like a zombie that i could control i'm a special kind of zombie a controllable zombie a crumby [Music] scheisse it's fine [Music] see that i jumped one i shouldn't have jumped i should have just slid down the ramp and then jumped and then grabbed onto the things and then didn't do didn't do it did i why does it put me all the way back here what the hell [Music] soon all right do i get to do that more soon blip blop is that what you're telling me [Music] almost you get into the city okay so we're nearly at the city then and the city bit that's where you get the the glider [Music] try that again [Music] okay at least i don't have to search that stuff again you kidding me he just he just bumped me off the game just went ah you belong here now god damn it it literally bumped me off then i didn't press sideways it just went ah you belong here now bye yeah maybe i just need to take my time on this bit [Music] i'm trying to make it look cool but instead i look a fall that's a life lesson for you guys huh [Music] this is clearly a safe away as well that's the tank can everybody relax [Music] just bump me off it just went by look at it [Music] don't bump me off again [Music] [Music] god here we go again [Music] that's how you do it you got a slide [Music] i'm sorry why is it not sliding if i die now i'm gonna go absolutely oh thank nuts for that usually it just slides on that [Music] we did it guys [Music] what's up mark thank you man [Music] at least the game isn't as buggy as cyberpunk um yeah [Music] we [Music] are we going upstairs [Music] [Music] i like finding these guys it's interesting oh god he just knocked me over [Music] you [Applause] lovely do you cut their arms and legs off as well is it just the heads i'm sure i've seen a few legs come off in my time they are filming this cyberpunk movie in my town what do you mean jim they've not announced the cyberpunk movie have they i've not heard anything about that anyway [Music] i mean ma i had um i streamed the whole game when cyberpunk came out and the graphics were amazing but i had several game breaking bugs where i had to like reload the game i know i know some people didn't but my experience of cyberpunk was like five or six game breaking bugs where i had to reload oh okay what are you trying to like jump on to there [Music] hold on i can loot this here [Music] find this [Music] i can't reach that can i um [Music] [Music] can't grab onto that black bit there i might be able to get out of the lamp yeah [Music] just [Music] shimmy around aqua all right what we got run up i can wall run now okay yes yes [Music] those clothes are actually better [Music] did they have like a load of pre-order bonuses for this where you could get like cheaty things that you could wear [Music] flashlight you saw the flashlight [Music] oh [Music] might play me isn't it okay that weapon's broke my purple weapon is broke guys just cosmetics okay do you guys know once a weapon has broke or whilst it's losing durability is there a way to fix it like you can zelda or is it just like when it breaks it breaks and that's it because i quite like that weapon it had good mods on it but it's gone now so ruined i guess i mean but if there's a way that you can fix it [Music] fling i'm gonna try this wall run out how do i do it i can't go through there i think if you upgrade it it repairs it oh so you mod it i see right so you mod it and that just puts it back on full health but once you put mods on you can't remove them can you like i couldn't figure out a way to do that are there guns i think there are jeff not many i haven't seen any yet though [Music] do you get that ability later in the game to remove the mods [Music] where is she you i already killed you once this time i'll do it right you're one of my curious good before i kill you you'll get a chance to witness something spectacular so shame i got a couple of two-handers yeah everything comes full circle we return to the beginning and now you will witness history in the making i didn't get low and arrows and crossbows years old kids we were kids he's so big you owe it to me that you are still alive that you are stronger than others special that you are stronger than i could have imagined yet not as strong as me any last words [Music] you're alive well he knows him of course they did tests on him he could have just asked him his name oh no he'll be fine is that rosario dawson i didn't know that she was in the game [Music] [Music] look at these nice ray trace reflections isn't that nice that has to be rosario right doesn't [Music] rosario [Music] oh my god [Music] there's [Music] he's a transformer is that a transformer [Music] god i hate this no leave me alone i don't think that's mia no this that can't be made [Music] why'd you close the bloody door on me [Music] like this [Music] i'm not trying to take my time guys all right how do i do the wall run you close that one as well stop closing the doors stop it [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was close right now talk who the [ __ ] are you i'm aiden and you i'm rosario dawson show me your arm from ahsoka i won't bite well not hard we have something in common i was one of that crazy [ __ ] subjects too mia did you know a girl named mia mia no who's me she's my sister we were in a gre place together i have to find her well if she's alive she must be pouring herself of water somewhere in the city what not that i'd blame her what what are you saying [ __ ] you oh god sign of the times the world we live in god joe what does that mean i'm saying i have to find her well first let's [ __ ] out of here not sure we managed to ditch that psycho [Music] hey wait hell she's first it's basically batman isn't it like it's disappeared yeah she's in daredevil as well and a few other things not far away i think most people nowadays young people anyway well known as ahsoka from the mandalorian and the book of the mandalorian [Music] [Applause] [Music] there we go look at that yeah oh i love that it's time for them the military they're here bring them in from earth to aiden man you're just a million miles away do you have nightmares about what he did to us all the time that's why i want to kill the [ __ ] waltz is number three on my list seriously do i look like i'm kidding the city's got a lot of trash and i'm the maid who's going to make it the capital of cleanliness uh who else is on it besides obviously many black teams and you know what it's a very long list there's a few small fries that deserve a bolt between the eyes as well and by whose authority are you doing this you kidding me the highest court of justice in the land my own noble authority your honor and you what were you doing with that bastard hack i'm looking for mia how did you know i knew him who do you think shot him when you were romancing each other in the cabin so what's your link with him you'll have a hard time believing this but he saved my life when i came to town i was infected no biomarker people at the bazaar wanted to hang me sure i'd do it myself but he got me out of there got me a biomarker can't believe he duped me he dupes everyone like everyone i trusted him once too really tell me about it maybe someday but my story's similar to yours he tricked me and people died better forget about him or do like me when you see him next make sure you have a crossbow and a bunch of bolts handy please give me a crossbow please not chatting let's go i need that crossbow bossy i like that we gotta go [Music] okay sophie's done for now [Applause] if it was a good video game i'd want to be when the gre noticed at some point they did i heard that's why they kicked them out too bad it was too late because they do like they don't just do the voice acting now in most games they do like motion capture and acting with other real people on set i think it would just be a cool thing to do because he killed lucas no i like those blue puppets the pks but no i don't give a [ __ ] about lucas's death why then that my dear is a long story for another day let's just say everyone on that list deserves a headshot and hackon deserves something worse boom headshot [ __ ] this was always open we're locked out [ __ ] great don't worry i've got the gre key do it aiden put the source in this is a gre facility come on oh man it worked where did you get that you know dylan [Music] dylan gave me this before he died waltz killed him [ __ ] so he got him after all also dylan told me to find someone named lawan you know who that is maybe we were meant to meet each other the universe brought us together for some [ __ ] up reason what i am the one dylan wanted to contact frank he said the pk commander lucas found something something walt's been looking for for a long time he wanted to escape on pc today gre i have it now probably lucas died because of this gizmo dylan too watch out or you'll be next it's valuable for waltz and valuable i suppose so you'd better not lose it look out what's going on impossible waltz must have switched on the generators waltz but why don't have a clue who knows what's in that fucker's head come on hurry the train is delayed the metro service is sorry for any inconvenience why are the announcements still playing in the mattresses thank you for your attention you're [ __ ] welcome hurry aiden it seems we have a clear path to the central loop so i think when we get out of this we're gonna end up in the city so this is this is really exciting [Music] [Music] boys girls we've got a bow i can craft arrows yes yes drop kick please let me learn that why won't you let me know that 180 health required you kidding grapple that's cool head stomp yeah i'll go with the parry i'm going to try this bow aidan over here yes [Music] okay right the game yes the game's definitely uh opened up a bit here when we get to this city you can use the bow and arrow as i've always said guys if you've watched me over the last 10 years bow and arrow it just makes every game better my hand was just going through my leg then head stomp is huge jack okay health or stamina health i'll keep it even are you kidding me i can probably get that no i can't i'm only 160 health [Music] are we going or what i was sightseeing funny yeah i feel like as the game goes on it just it does improve i don't think the writing's improved though but the gameplay definitely come up to the has we'll check it from above yeah churrock and churro2 were great games that's like nintendo 64 days for me i played those it's quite dark yeah we made it i was wrong can't see [ __ ] [Music] i really thought it would work you're [ __ ] duped oh well um at least it's peaceful yeah that's why i come here when i'm pissed off so a lot believe me look aidan they're back on they're [ __ ] coming back on you see that even you see that it's beautiful oh i can't believe it no i just can't believe it you're seeing this oh i see it daniel i'm at a lookout point and it's quite the show how's this happen dark as hell for 15 years and suddenly this i don't know don't know but we need to die then drop by the campaign and let's talk been missing you like last year's snowmobile while shotgunning beers and screwing bartenders you'll know me it's a gift [Applause] [Music] dumbass something's wrong no oh no no no no no [ __ ] what the hell's going on so that's the fish eye okay how do we get there the fish eyes gotta wait gotta wait but why did he just change today instantly we need to check the substations ones over there level with the pk tower what about the fish eye listen i want to help you and i will help we'll do this together but you have to understand it's the first it's been the same situation for over 10 years ten years of this [ __ ] darkness we gotta check this out is this the glider how do we get to the substation it's an old power glider it'll help you get to places you normally can't reach [Music] just follow me caramel i think i'll check out world war three for the beta yeah [ __ ] so how am i going to use this paraglider hold z to open the paraglider ball in the air press s to pull up and stabilize the 4. of course it drains your stamina [Music] you going again not bad for a rookie it's easier than it looks i still can't believe this is happening i think walt's turned the power on somehow but why would he do that he's never helped anyone why would he give people power back are you sure it was him he used the gre key in the car factory i think that's when everything lit up that makes sense years ago the military took over the plan to secure the energy cells in the hills but i had no idea they could still be made to work and power half the city keep an eye on that key aiden hal knows what else can be done with it we better hurry to the substation [Music] using air vents flying to an air but using a paraglider to get a directional boost flying over an event also replenishes your stamina [Music] okay so these little boosters but you better keep practicing if you hope to beat me i didn't know it was race it's always a race aided oh my super jump it's going way better aiden but you have to control the wind otherwise it controls you that's why you need renny or gaviscon [Music] [Music] i'm getting the hang of it okay from here it's not far at all to the substation the music's nice in this page on my own you're a big boy you'll figure it out there's another one near the metro i'll check that one if we get one or both of these working means we can activate all of them hey but how do i activate it it's not rocket science aiden those are old systems i guess we need to make sure fuses and cables are working okay this is gone bye [Music] where is it there's no events this is a whole new area isn't it i think this might be a good time to end the stream today guys um thank you for watching i've had a lot of fun with this um hopefully you guys have enjoyed it in the chat as well i mean a lot of uh great comments in the chat appreciate you all being here let me know your thoughts and matt thank you the five yeah we'll be back tomorrow though for more i don't know maybe we'll finish it tomorrow maybe not maybe monday we'll see i can upgrade the paraglider can i okay interesting cool but yeah this is a whole new area hey have to pay respects this is going to be fun exploring this more zombies as well um if you enjoyed it guys leave a like alex you can watch afterwards as a vod if you want but yeah i need to um i need to get ready because i'm going to my mom's for dinner i haven't seen my mom in in a while and she's inviting me around for dinner and uh she lives like an hour hour and 15 minutes away so i need to get over there before it gets late um but yeah once again a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this we were playing streaming in 4k today using dlss which basically means more frame rate that's what it boils down to and it allows you to use like other graphic settings that you might not have the headroom for if you were playing at native resolution that uses ai to make the image look good and also we were playing with ray tracing turned on rtx cards allow ray tracing in this game so we get gorgeous shadows ambient occlusion and the most important one here is the global illumination which really makes the game pop brings it to life and also you get a ray trace flashlight which is cool um but yes there it is guys once again a big thank you for tuning in appreciate you guys we'll be back tomorrow as i said tune in and we'll continue the story right enjoy the rest of your day take care of yourselves take care of each other i'll see you next time bye you
