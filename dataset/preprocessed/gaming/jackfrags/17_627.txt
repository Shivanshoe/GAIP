defend yourself he's big but I'm quicker I'll stay out of his reach wait for him to get tired then drop him with one strike good a samurai must always fight with patience and discipline even when his opponent resorts to trickery I remember uncle now break through my defenses show me gin Sakai is a warrior of great courage too Oh block that one attack and strike quickly is wobbling around

looks gorgeous man very atmospheric you know how this unit gin what happened I found a little shimmer I could have saved him but the con was there I fail through my uncle at least you're in one piece I swore to protect this island with my life but now the Mongols have stolen our home killed or Samurai he forgot what it's like to fight someone stronger than you to be a week you did give me a beat down sometimes when you're staring death in the face you have to do whatever it takes to survive the Khan expects to fight a war against the samurai he will anticipate our every move unless we find new ways to surprise him that's how we'll save Lord shimmer and retake our home we'll need some help bridges the console tech talks there's too many of them hide in the grass they're so close I think we're okay bastard scared off the horses there's some right mounts trained to return to their masters looking up straight away nice trick the Mongols must be hunting you we should split up I'll draw their attention while you escape I'm not leaving your side until we've saved my brother first I need to find more allies trained warriors like since a scar and lady must have all about you they can help my brother can help too once we save him you'll have the islands best blacksmithing your debt he'll make whatever tool you need to save your uncle something to scale the castle walls for you dream it taka can make it where are they holding him he was captured near catchy right there and ask around him I'll join you soon taka won't last long in a Mongol cage we will save your brother and your uncle [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all the drama love that music very good so I can open them up now alright it's got open world Susheela island discover new locations this is a tale like main story Warriors code the broken samurai as your legend grows you will learn powerful new techniques the wind will take me there I can Gus the wing with that trackpad would you look at that you stroke the trackpad up and it just gusts the wind in the direction you gotta go that's cool there's not much on the screen really I just have to follow the wind it looks like it's headed up here it's an interesting way of giving the player a bit of navigation just got some new wood oh that gets addictive that gets really addictive very detailed environment this isn't it some dead peeps yeah that's you know Mongol territory oh no oh she's down here yeah she's fine she can look after herself well I should have heard him coming let myself get distracted these people saw Mongols marching prisoners upriver they had a blacksmith with them your brother sounds like it they were taking him to a camp near the Canada Inlet I know the place did you find any samurai to free your uncle not yet but I'm still searching I'm sure you'll find someone soon right so we would you know again now we've got to go to an overlook I mean the prison camp can help you after we save him hard to believe I might see him soon he's lucky to have you you might disagree that's what some things are for what about you any brothers or sisters Lord shim Roth is my only family what will you do when he's three take a breath cuz then I'll know there's hope for our island you feel that strongly I've watched him win victory against impossible odds and after your brother is free what then honestly I haven't had time to think about it you're riding well how are you wounds mostly healed your bandages did the trick you don't share much about how you feel do you I suppose you're right my uncle taught me that a samurai masters his emotions like you master a horse or blade that's a hard way to live it's not supposed to be easy worried so easy there's a spot up ahead that overlooks the river should give us a good view of the Mongol camp just up here to get inside the Mongols through that place together in days there has to be a way in let's look we need to reach taka without putting him in danger we'll find a safe approach defenses in back are formidable what's down here you could scare the rocks on that side if they're loose they might give way alert the guards hmm the front wall they're still under construction could be a way in we can look for a gap in the front wall slip inside and cut down the Mongols where they stand if something goes wrong they'll kill the prisoners I've seen them do it we have to go in quietly like thieves what's wrong with that before the samurai this island it was ruled by criminals we changed that by creating order and delivering justice in the open we live by a code of honor and sometimes we die by it warriors like my father we just wanted to give us a safer home I want the same thing but we have to fight back [Music] you gotta fight desi to save my family and what's left of yours you got to change that's got a closer look see what we're up against we should wait until he gets darker let's move TACA he's been through a lot even before the invasion but you took care of him someone had to he hated when I stole but it was that or stuff he didn't have a choice I didn't choose to be a songwriter but going against my instincts my cold it's better than getting wiped up by the Mongols we have to fight back any way we can can we squeeze through here through here [Music] if they see us they'll kill the prisoners and we better stay quiet oh [Music] yes he's agreed [Music] what do you think June the Bears running with a limp your era wounded him this is when a beast is most dangerous remain inert yes I go keep after him I didn't think bears lived here they don't but the fighting in yurikawa drove some this way so it's the rebels fault we should feed them to this bears punishment we are not his blood bear the bear stumbled here is it dying no but we're getting closer drag this way all the way through yes uncle if it's still alive can I take the shot prove you can control your emotions perhaps I can always control my emotions huh it's here we've got him careful he could still be alive this arrow should not have killed him look uncle there's a gash in his side not from an arrow no shake you would star in the back roll yourself criminals like this man here yes what I tried to kill you must answer for this crime with his life look him in the eye the teaching has someone I never acts out of anger of fear and take his life with honor [Music] when we fight we face our enemy head-on [Music] when we take their life we look them in the eye with courage and respect this is what makes us samurai only cowards straight from the shadows sometimes you gotta it's his first dishonourable Kell June what's wrong let's find your brother I can't let them see us used all your senses think and move like focused hearing let's trap how to use focused hearing just going for the kill straight away on this guy I think we should be okay Oh shengcún you're next I've got to there this dude look at the size of that stay in the shadows and then strike in the top of the head all make this heads on sticks what was that good can we help him anyway oh he's very very dead what's that no bug job for the heads there's one guy in there look around the back [Music] some artifacts and supplies love that bit of raiding never hurt anyone is he gonna move try and get around this way [Music] oh he's got too we need to go we'll talk when it's safe come on get out of there let's get to the river we'll be safe there are you with the straw hat Ronin I was cut ties with them after they started running low on rations Lord shim has been captured and I could use some extra swords to free him are you looking for work no but the other straw hats maybe last I heard they were hunting Mongols in sits of Prefecture by the coast near the kishi grasslands that's pretty successful this way we're looking for my brother a blacksmith named Tucker don't know him but a lot of prisoners moved to here you said they were moving the slaves where they mentioned as a mobi and there was a blacksmith in the last group young man with a beard from atacama maybe you'd better be right I hope you find your blacksmith Takas alive in Osmo Bay the town is surrounded by walls rushing in without a plan will only put him in more danger I have a friend who might be able to get us inside find him the sooner we rescue took her the sooner we saved my uncle Jun taco will Forge whatever tool you need as soon as he's free but after that we're leaving the island you've seen what the Mongols are doing you notice Americans stop them stay help us fight for a home home is wherever taka and I go [Music] my friend lives in Osmel Prefecture on the border with tutor I'll find you there I know this wasn't easy going against your code I did what I had to thank you Joshua you deserve better than this convince your people to stop resisting and you can walk free stop wasting my time kill me you think you've lost everything but your nephew is still alive my men control the roads they build war camps near your towns they see everything and they will find him Lord Sakai will fight until his last breath as will I you love him just as you love your people your father to them will you abandon your children to make them your slaves a technique point cool you've earned a technique point use it to learn powerful new techniques that will aid in your fight deflection evasion deflection is pretty cool let's do that there's also this mythic stuff here Wow oh that looks sick I can set my sword on fire gig explosive arrows stances there's different stances as well
