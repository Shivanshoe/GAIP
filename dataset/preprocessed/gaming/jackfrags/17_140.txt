we're not dislocating my neck it looks normal to me tom completely normal another thing you can do watch this oh my god no nah right right does that look behind you oh you can look behind you yeah you can do that in real life actually no i can't really see it that far tear him stumble onto the floor when he falls out of his chair that really hurt i shouldn't do that have i done my task now eliminate yes five scarves on customs oh yeah there you go i swapped mine i can see you now does the laser give me a better hit pack on it yeah flashlights lasers they all give you better hip fire better point fire that's cool how can you face off is it always a one-hit kill headshot if you hit someone in the face yep no matter what the gun or bullet no matter what the gun or bullet okay can you get in that big black blue and white building there no no if you try you'll run overland mines oh oh i missed oh god that doesn't sound good tom i just watched that are you dead yeah he's dead just instantly died dude oh no jumped all the way down that doesn't look like a fatal fall though why did it kill me oh god if stone was here now or never at the end of it demographic i don't believe it i just wanted to get onto that ramp and it just made me walk off the right side of it as soon as i landed jumped over don't give me that no i i like what did you see me try and land on it yeah you missed it completely just even like a long way down though take the meg jack in his rig okay did the scabs hear you running yeah they will react to sound but for the most part uh they don't really aggro unless they see you or you've been fighting hold on you shoot him in the head i aimed at him connor he's run away hold on got him oh that sounded juicy how do we get the dawns is this the round to take yep yeah you gotta go over the wooden bridge where do you see weight connor didn't know how to scale they're great enemy henry as a player i think you killed him yeah well done jack is that a player show me up another one up to the right got him nice turn me out bro turn me up could be more pushing up a little bit dakota one this is a player 41. he's got the compass this guy was 45. bankroll the tactical rig is that any good no um he's got a onsling ahs12 he's got an ash 12. i knew it was a bigger gun hold on it looks like an odin or something dude yeah that's exactly what it is take that take the meds in his pocket hey down for a party everyone knows now that we're here so is there usually someone in here usually often depending on where you spawn there's a there's two dorms adjacent towards another you can see the others on the other side yeah there's three levels in this one i believe so there's a staircase to your left halfway down uh there's a main door on your right this is horrible this is the washroom i just like to check this and then you can jump out the back window here okay down well done yeah there's another one to add oh yeah got him nice i work is it worth checking these for luke yes cavs can spawn with like some of the rare salute only search their pockets and they're begged high explosive frag projectile for a 30 millimeter cannon used on armored combat vehicles and helicopters wait is it the tank shot no it looks like a big tank shell oh my god jack take what is in his bag those stims yeah those sell for a lot okay they're like 50 kps each these doors spawn open or closed um a couple of them keep you guessing there's a roof there the outdoor ones will never spawn open oh they did hit mark's room yeah that might be a mark yeah well the satanic ritual this is the march room so you could just literally find like can you still find a box on the floor there connor i think still a spawn yes you could find like a weapon crate jack it's just on the ground there and you can carry out with you and sell it or like keep it because they cost how much like millions millions yeah it's mad i'm here have you died at all no i haven't died at all i don't think he has let's go but neither of you con yeah me neither neither was tom either yeah that's crazy 13 minutes uh i see we don't risk it because if we go that way there's a chance yeah it's a long get out saw sprinting on the railroad they do sprint now okay yeah they did that before if they're up at the top of the railroad no that's the player top railroad let's play with him yeah we should chase movement yeah oh you split off from myself i see his feet i see his feet where is he tom just behind just find the train on me yeah backside of the building here right on me i'm gonna need it no i didn't see this second those guys we gotta be careful i don't know if i got the one is he on the roof where is he i did kill one if you see two there's three connor he's at the far side of the train god i'm so easy to get what was that jesus oh yeah did you get him no no he's still alive damn guys my first death okay i'm just underneath there's another scav right side of the train i died on top of the train you might as well look at me jack yeah that way that you're facing i went off that ramp that's why i died it's just a scarf yeah well you just killed that guy my body's up there get him jack nice good news is we can extract her too oh sweet this guy's got ump that's the one that tom had right i'll say my tag on the right jack no a god i'd just kill had it tom so he must have lured you oh okay yeah he looted me can we save this then or how does that work it's not sure if you could just ditch it okay or you can or you can keep it for yourself jack yeah i have a slick i'm also slick is that attack it's end game for check man oh we just spotted someone what do you mean game huh where'd you spot somebody back the way we came over here it's down to your left i think i got a reload oh you almost got one tap icon of that there's another one further back this guy's still not dead really i did see someone else further back got him nice yeah that was that was the skin jack run in between heard more movement up front yeah yeah ah behind us i've got a hill con i'm messed up using masala server connection lost error no no way can i reconnect yes no you can oh there is a reconnect in this game [Music] should i just let you do it from the menu jack i was bleeding your character is still in the raid escape from tarkov reconnect yeah connect what the hell there was one more guy back there khan i'm just trying to watch your body right now you made it around the corner which is nice no just blacked out of like that right we only have five minutes yeah you lose uh like stability and stuff right when eds yeah becomes a lot more difficult loading data files it takes a second to join but you'll be good if you're in the bushes there gonna repack mags loading map you got time jack don't worry we're not far connecting you still killed in that state though right connor like if he was to primary connect i might just say you were killed no no no no no no no does he disappear when he disconnects [Music] his character i don't know he's still alive yeah because you could exploit that couldn't you but that's my point if jack was to disconnect can a player still find his body and kill him no no no no no no no he's dead what what happened scarve someone shot me yep oh dude i had so much good stuff i was repacking my mags oh there was loads of stuff on me that takes so long for you to reconnect jack jesus yeah that takes a long time that'd take a really long time i'll take your mask take all the things take that big rifle i had connor and i've got two amps as well that's painful that is i hate that yeah [Music] you
