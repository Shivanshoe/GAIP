the ak-47 a classic choice in many video games throughout the years from one tapping people's heads in counter-strike to beaming people on crash in cod 4. it's one for the ages for sure unfortunately though up until recently the ak was what could be described as a chocolate kettle in call of duty war zone useless but now that the game has been balanced guns have been nerfed buffed and all of the attachments have been fixed the cold war ak is actually a good choice and that brings copious amounts of joy to my brain so today i put a build together that would work as a medium and long range destroyer this one right here you've got to level it up a bit but when you do get these attachments this thing can dominate and you're going to see that in today's gameplay myself and westy duos in trios this was an absolutely insane match that was great to play and edit i think you guys will enjoy it an action-packed beginning middle and end some nice sniper shots too it's all you want from a game of war zone really and if you do enjoy it hit that like button and leave a comment below have you used the ak and how do you feel about it in this new emerging meta with that said it's game time

we get a doubt you know what's happening have you got any stuns uh no i don't have any okay so we've got to hope this guy well we've got to hope we can kill him first we've got to hope he's got herself as is he it could be over here i don't know [Laughter] if he kills us we're ruined i'm gonna uninstall the game yeah if we don't win that's it for our careers we're done are you really serious spiderman okay stand there on there we need to test the water first cam because it could be could be an mig pro you know i'll take up i'll take up concrete here going this way he's not he's not

him i'll see if i can down him no oh i can't do the clap either no ruined no no bm why no toxicity oh that was a damn good game man that aka surprise dude yeah absolutely incredible absolutely incredible i think it also i don't know if you noticed it the abs time on it is almost instant it snaps straight into ads yeah very quick if you use the a max you know how long it can take to ads with the amax um i think that's why the ak is actually better than the amax at the moment because you can just get on site quicker there's a base boom so hopefully that's demonstrated just how good this thing can be yeah you can't go storming into buildings but if you hang back a bit and play carefully it will win you matches give it a go and finally as always a massive thank you to all of these guys
