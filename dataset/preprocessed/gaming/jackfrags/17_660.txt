hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more call of duty warzone today we are going to be playing with the brand new weapon which in the game is known as the cr-56 amax or amax however you want to pronounce it i don't know but we all know it as the galil and i've leveled it up i spent the entire day grinding in multiplayer and i've built what i think is a pretty a pretty tasty build for warzone and in this video in this live stream today this is what we'll be using but the monolithic suppressor on there the zodiac barrel so that's your standard barrel but when you go with the zodiac actually adds a ton of range increased bullet velocity and it gives you some really nice recoil control you do sacrifice a bit of ads speed and movement speed but for me like it's it's nice like it's it's the right choice for warzone would i take it in multiplayer maybe not maybe not commando foregrip you know i like to put commando full grip on all of my assault rifles and the 45 round mags i've tested these they do more damage but they force your gun into semi-auto mode and i just i don't feel like it's a good pick for war zone you know you're dealing with people who have theoretically 250 health points so taking the 45 is a much better option for for war zone i think and also longer range scope i'm not a big fan of the iron sights on this so you can go with like a vlk which we'll be playing with to start with tonight but also i like the gi mini reflex on there so that's the build that we'll be playing with tonight and i'm going to be joined by aculite and homographic it should be good trios tonight full communication full sweat mode we'll see how it goes now also today you may have noticed that camo that i had on there that's actually part of the call of duty endowment and it's a pack that you can buy where all of the proceeds go to us and uk vets trying to get them back into work but it's like a special camo that you can get but it's kind of cool it's unique like i've never really seen anything else like that in the game there's also a little boonie hat charm that you get with it and also the operator this dude here where is he venerated it's quite a cool looking skin and there's a couple of calling cards too which i've equipped as well as a spray but yeah like i said that's the uh the fearless pack it also comes with um i think it comes with an m4 an m4 build that one there but yeah like i said all the proceeds of that go towards um uk and us vets getting them back into work that's kind of cool so that's what we're rocking tonight and we're gonna have some fun i'm really looking forward to it i don't know if we'll use the vector today we might do i did have a vector build but i think i've accidentally deleted it um where did it go did i save it as a custom mod bennek i can't stand that name why is it called fennick why is it called fennec isn't the fennek a fox i'm pretty sure it's a fox isn't it but yeah this is what i was rocking on the vector yesterday but i've kind of changed it a bit so yesterday i was using the um apex barrel but i actually think the deadfalls better and it comes with the integrated suppressor ranger foregrip 40 round drum mag what else did i put on it i think i had the tack laser and one of the stocks the zlr blade that one that's my vector build now i've changed my mind you know i think i had it wrong when i was streaming yesterday so we might do like an updated build of that but tonight this is what we're going with the gallow it's nice give it give it a chance i know a lot of people have just rubbished it and said well it's not as good as the m4 of the growl maybe not but it does shine in certain situations it's a fun weapon to use anyway i mean for me personally i i like using something different i don't always like to use the growl and the m4 all the time i think it kind of gets a bit boring but let's see if these guys are ready you guys good to go i am good to go all right get in the lobby time let's do this you're not joining oh yeah we should did we join ah connor did you join me yeah you joined me yeah yeah so we're in your lobby connor yeah yeah cool so what bills are you going for are you going for a galil vector what are you using today i'm going to be using the galil okay the cr-50 i don't have my max anyway yeah i need to write mine up a lot more vectors pretty much maxed it's got the important attachments at least but i'm using pk and vector worked really well yesterday yeah i'm going to figure out if i want oh you've got it yeah jack yeah he's been using it he's been really liking it for real it absolutely slays no way the pkm's got a really unique attachment as a foregrip as well which is called a snatch grip and it adds recall control and aim down sight speed okay and if you really want to enhance the edius you could have like attack laser and stipple grip as well which is crazy i don't think i've ever built a pkm for war zone no but uh it's definitely underrated it's really hard 100 rounds as well i mean it's great for squad games yeah i'll have to unlock all the attachments secondary i think the most important ones are near the start yeah check it out right cue us up connor should we ready all right let's do this let's do this so what are you using on yours jack on the the galil yeah okay so i've got mono zodiac the okay optic commando 45 round mags oh okay oh so you're going for okay aaron i see you see what do you think have you tried it in war zone yet or was this just i've tried it a little bit yeah i've tried it a bit in war zone i think it's okay okay i'm trying to figure out what i want to use for my size is 50 right 45 45. oh is it that's what i guess you get kicked from here alone up uh tom you got kicked from the party or something then yeah i don't know what happened there just fetch an online profile for me it was too attractive so it just went sorry i guess so get out the lobby you can't be playing because they're playing with us i have a terrible glitch on on my character right now like his eyeballs are all white i've seen pictures of that actually captain price yeah is that an actual glitch oh okay it's like giving you the evil eyes yeah it looks quite terrifying [Laughter] i heard some wild voice lines from captain price when we were playing yesterday he's got some juicy ones yeah oh really not sound like lines that price should be saying yeah they're way too like aggressive are you having difficulty joining the lobby tom joining game session right there get in here yeah i'm ready to go yeah we spoke to uh barry sloane the other day jack he uh hopped in a in a call with us because stone was streaming um for saint jude's and he recorded all of his voice lines from home no way during quarantine barry sloane is the guy that voices captain price in this price yeah yeah that's cool lockdown voice acting that's impressive right you couldn't tell i mean they sound pretty good quieter he does sound pretty quiet in game for some reason but yeah like they sent him a uh a little mock-up recording studio essentially he lives in california what are these english voice actors that live in california yeah i mean i think they kind of have to all the work's there that's where all the work is yeah certainly hello nicola hello dean alvin how you doing what's up lexanator can you do a video on the ax50 i'm not a big fan of the ax50 to be honest not a big fan of it i much prefer the hdr so what are you using today then tom vector pkm i mean i'm going to try and primarily use the vector i mean i tried to use it with a sniper yesterday but i didn't have the 25 round mag at a time towards the late half of our play session yeah it just doesn't have the range i found to compete even with the barrel and like that huge suppressor that is specific to the gun yeah i didn't feel like i feel like the mp5 is still way better than the mk7 but it's definitely a fun gun to use it's gonna be it's it will outperform the mp5 if you were like a skilled after a player if you missed shots then yeah i don't think so quite as fast i don't think for the rate of fire surely the dps is gonna be higher each bullet might do less damage but the right fire will account for it maybe i don't know i feel like the mp5 just decimates people that is good oh i got the two sticks yeah i got them as well has to be done in the name of content oh absolutely running around smacking people with some wooden sticks that's that's the dream that's the dream a melee weapon right yeah yeah i want any chance you could get four people in squads and pick skins that are purple blue orange and red and just see that's it that's the means role players the turtles fantastic uh there was a squad above us they were close to us somewhere i cannot stand this burst m4 why is it a thing oh can you not change it to full though no you can't build isn't it yeah it's here this one look at it horrible why are you in the game this is it's not the m4 i've got is it oh it is i found them oh yeah he's right right there in the window i could see his elbow sticking behind you thank you on the roof again on my bro add the vector how did they already have a picture of the window push up yeah we can brush this down spawn does it i don't think it's a legendary oh in a crate that's my kill confirmed killed water it's just yolo to the roof it's called javelin can i go this way the other guy was further up right you can show me the flashlight [Music] i'm a scary boy actually i don't know the syringe yeah someone got rid of it one down hold up oh played nice yeah i think he like climbed off the edge of the roof or something and just dropped down there down he's getting revived getting revived in the bush um brush wikis and we could get loadout already if you want should we just go for it oh yeah yeah yeah for sure why wouldn't we i think complete the contract a bit more thomas there you go oh just go down here i'm gonna put a mine down on the buy station just be that guy you know oh come on don't do it i'll turn to that one here you go right scala time i mean look at this skin jack how could you not watch the ckm wow that's impressive it's crazy put that thing away your pants are really tight as well tom yeah it's hard to buy oh of course oh res 300 go drone jk do not but there's a vehicle here yeah that's not far off that road is it i need a bit of ar ammo if you guys could spare someplace um i don't even have much myself a little bit thank you how much do you have now just i've just got one spare mag it's fine okay look at this this baller over here do you want to go there let's check respawn was right here wasn't it i believe so okay yeah yeah real close i might be them shooting might move to these houses you see gunshots i can just here fighting over there i saw a um i saw a shotgun over those houses should we get a munitions box i mean we've got the money oh how did we get all that money no because we completed the con complete uh medium threat can i put it here yeah you can buy extra plates please there are guys across north drop 500 if you need it triple threat where are they they're like beyond the blue there at the wall oh yeah just beyond that's a brave player right there ballsy indeed yeah it's a brave player both of us shooting at him he dropped real quick yeah he did there's two more armor plates here it's always pistol smg ammo that the uh the satchels get stuck in it's a nightmare yeah or the kill streaks yeah shield hearts yeah i hope they do something with the shield turret i would like to see that thing a little bit more viable can you mount it on the back of a truck now not doable that's what i mean like it's the in a vehicle like in a heli or something which is so cool hello mason how you doing thank you for coming along this is your first stream wow thank you i appreciate you being here what's up ava how are you doing have you guys used the minigun yet i'm fine no is it it's kind of violence right it's it's attached is it no it's guaranteed if you go in bunker 11 so you have to do the the phones again i've not i've not seen one yet like in one of my games at least i've seen videos of it that's a lot of work uh guys oh both sides are great i'm a broke on one push in i think i'm hitting him through the house this is the big game so that's the beauty of the pkm is about 100 rounds default just to absolutely hose them he's gonna try and crawl in there you got eyes on jack nope don't see him okay he may have made it in there yeah i think so nothing up here we're banging the guy at the top pro comma brook one bottom floor i think he's on the top it goes melted that human oh i should have went in with my chopsticks oh for maximum maximum name oh look at it you're actually this is not it's not the captain price i remember you've ruined my new and improved go and swing them that is the coolest thing cool i like it though than the axe i bought the axe too but these things are so sick your mouth hold on stand still and do it look at his mouth tom oh what the hell ah that's really odd anyway i don't like that i like it is there a special take down with them as well no you know what maybe wasn't a special like it's a preview isn't it it was literally shielded i'm not going to go ghost i'm going to restock as well grabbing a sniper because i want to make sure i use the gun i'm gonna be haunted by that uh captain price face now yeah it's quite disturbing the sounds that they make is great though you hold it underneath your arm as well like yeah it doesn't look like that on my screen you have one that's underneath your arm that's sick it's proper stick hucking etiquette i'm sure that's the uh the actual turn around that's all i want to do majority of time like when i equip something like this but it's so difficult to use yeah does he say cowabunga when he does a takedown cowabunga no but i could say it you could say yeah do your best captain price impression cowabunga i don't even know how you want me to try to do that oh no i know it'd be good that's all you need to know then jack because he'll never do it he might surprise us tom he might surprise yeah full of surprise i don't know he's got like he's got kind of like a grungy voice right but it's a little bit softer yeah it's a voice actor is from liverpool but he does like a london accent but you hear a bit of the liverpool coming through don't you tom occasionally yeah if it is there definitely the recoil or the lack of record with this thing it's crazy have you got a big scope on it yeah just have a little spray with that john wait is that new repositioning oh there's there's no recall exactly there's actually no it just it hits so hard is what new connor um on blue mark is that new there's like a tunnel there yeah yeah there's like there's like a whole railway thing under the ground now there's also a guy over there i never saw that yeah i didn't notice that we didn't come here yesterday i start fights around military base for some reason yeah it's a brand new tunnel the railway track is going to be important i think to the uh whatever happens to the map to the whole nuke thing maybe it transports the warhead to the dam a couple of the bunkers are in here does the track go to the dam it probably does uh oh no loops all the way around to the base there thank you i'm the lacking ammo guy today two different teams i think oh they're sniping yeah two different teams down the far right one this guy up to the left here there you don't really fight at these ranges with assault rifles this is kind of cool i'm gonna bring it with iron boats especially with this lmg they're falling back up right now oh there's a guy there oh there is yeah do have a drone if you guys have before chopsticks pandas guys i think there's two way his armor broke yeah very lit there back side it was two i think watch out well this is it he's upstairs right sorry oh yeah get him kind of get him down jack's oh no i've made a big mistake did you buy armor did you get one i can get one there's 113 ar here oh okay this guy had quite a bit although i do have my plate so that works for me this guy's lagging back i'm gonna drop all my plates and then pick those up hang on let me just wait until season five for my lmg to reload oh there's a guy here [Applause] ranking [Applause] it should be right here on blue stunning okay down the one on the left side oh he's running out making a break for it at the back here inside this guy is wily man good nice job nice shot i don't think she had anywhere to go yeah there's no oh no actually well there's another gu lager over here i'm blue okay just keep going back and forth until we run into someone with a minigun oh please don't say that i'd really enjoy that [Music] i do have the high ground i'm going to go up to the roof you i can't believe you didn't say anakin at the end of that time i'm sorry jack i'll let you down got another down guys are just slapping everything i just i didn't say the line correctly jack that's why it was definitely in my head but it's okay you can make up for it with another stinging star wars reference later on okay or a yoda impression you know yoda impression would be just as good you just always trying to get all these impressions out of us jack is it because you secretly have a price and yoda under your belt no i'm just playing you know a game of mental bingo like how many things can i make you guys say every time you do i have to drink okay maybe we should start playing this game 200 meters there is it there's a guy closer here on me oh they're on a a 4x4 over there connor let's group up a bit we're a bit spread yeah yeah i was just buying it from the teams here okay could go and buy a cell press maybe hey go for it i suppose seeing as i'm playing for footage today i should probably start recording that would be that would be a good idea come on yeah i should probably do that yeah i'll think about it it's the worst isn't it when you forget to press record it is yeah uh yeah it really hurts it hurts i mean i suppose 10 kills into the match i could probably start your time you can use the what's going on oh conor's just killed everyone okay yeah it's just that's just how it usually is when you play with acura [Applause] you guys wanted to buy something okay he doesn't make call outs you just see five people down there on the couch wait i didn't want to interrupt you guys you guys were having so that's just really considerate that's just the canadian in you that's just the canadian in you well we have ammo and stuff now and money we've got everything i'm sorry guys i didn't want to interrupt hey that's terrible sorry about daddy what that accent was come on are you mocking my canadian accent i think the team on blue is the one that i just killed that came over you were the chosen one tell you what though this gun's not that bad it does a lot of damage it's got some punch to it yeah um i think it does slightly more damage than the m4 and the growl it's kind of kind of advanced effect sounds a lot like kylo ren jack if that pleases you you've got a kylo ren voice effect well whenever i use my walkie-talkie voice effect people say i sound like kylo ren say okay i will finish what you started do that i will finish that was a bit too english though wasn't it yeah but is he like he's got like an american english twang it's not america you've got you got to adam driver up a notch how would one do that i did get that guy down by the way hours of research and dedication he uh instantly raised on that i got a stunt down very nice well it's a played of damage there was a lift on the buy station that i marked so i fired 40 shots in that engagement but it felt more like two that's just because you shoot so fast with it man yeah oh i hear a vector yeah there's one around somewhere sounds really good here i'm gonna grab his kill contract do it what else does kylo ren say he says i've uh i burnt down the jedi temple the sacred texts all of it that's a good impression jack that really sounded like adam driver didn't know hello yes in the discord my name is kylo ren grandfather this is played by jack frank show me again the ways of the dark side okay know what i think i like jack's version better you'd watch that movie wouldn't you you know jj abrams 100 got the casting wrong i heard it here first money's down if you need it dude i'm going to get you if you need if you need money let me know i'll drop it off okey-dokey we just i'll carry that cash just in case 0.1 interest rate at the moment guys sorry it's a bit low all right you know it's not much about 30 p every year there's shots outside of zone that way was it yeah vector you actually heard a vector from this range i'm impressed pretty close got to be another spot on the roof surely oh i just hopped off okay about five loadout drops hmm i don't see anyone behind us this is weird right like i feel like there should be guys on the rooftops trying to snipe at us let me get this drone in the air that's a good yeah palmer i've got two c4s oh well then bring it down here put it down on me as they say in the industry did they say that let's do this uh hold on wait it's got to be two as well okay okay more seafood there's gotta be four wait wait wait okay now we're good to go oh no one fell that's fine okay there's a full squad right here guys that's gonna be at a range you ready for this i'm so ready for range yeah there's a sniper at the back kind of i've seen there yeah okay was it anyone in between us tom on the uav no yeah you're good yeah it's just those guys they came out from where you are right now there's one guy maybe inside on the left okay you see my uav [Music] oh my god my savior [Music] are you thank you i want guys up above us yeah okay i don't want to get stuck down here there's one on my left i can hear him he said there's two right there other side of the fence yeah he said she right there oh lovely yeah rest i think was the lower guy [Music] i'm watching you're right they're not pushing out i'm just getting out of here dude hey yeah yeah just run we could swing at the bottom armor box on me if you want to pick that up

all right real question though should i go for my loader job i don't know risky business that is kind of i'm just watching behind us because i did not trust this might come in through the roof i think we're good they're going to be moving to our right aren't they popping you over there one jumps okay well i got it good job do you guys have a little bit of ar ammo yeah just a little bit extra s2 perfect thank you she need more eight people left k for now i think we should probably cross over to like yeah yeah we should totally get blue right now clear this left side on the roof or right i did dig damage on him he's not repeating that i'm pushing up i was at least three plays just didn't get the break could be someone in this compound we taking this then boys yeah yeah yeah let's do it do you have extra plates so you could drop me yeah i can drop a couple perfect that's all i would need thank you one extra outside that door should take the roof yep but be careful this room on the left

don't think i've heard of that one it's hollyoaks and uh maybe it's a little bit before your time then it's almost as bad as hollywood how many kills do you guys have i mean it wasn't around very long two i've got 12 between us four all right oh yeah you can check that mid game yeah yeah i love that after all that we still don't have enough money for now we do but we make about i don't need that make my own dreams you are the dream just want to get this right shield so i can see the skin let's go get the weaponry i really enjoyed the new uh menu music that's cool this got the skin on it the yellow skin the right shield is that yellow no no maybe because someone else had already picked it up oh no have you got the skin connor pick that up which skin the right one the turtle oh it's not putting it on for some reason oh i haven't equipped it yet all right you need to have it you need it in your own custom class submachine gun all right uh do we need ammo or should we start getting southwest i would get yeah get some ammo get some ammo just in case okay i might need to restart my game after this oh nevermind you got lights it's part of the reason why i'm not streaming i've been having some pretty yeah it's running like 60. yeah it feels much better when i don't stream i put it back in full screen and it seemed to fix it choose a one pc setup jack or two two yeah i'd never go back to one okay so many problems yeah yeah having to eliminate a lot of issues yeah i'm looking to get in a second now this one is all been shot from behind where from how far out that was i didn't hear a shot i just felt the receiving what's up julian i think hey jonathan perez how are you man yeah good to see you in the stream jonathan first class that was we could do you want to get the kill contract and go for yeah do it get the bouncer as well are they beating maybe oh are they on youtube full team one's a little left of this building one to the right just about 100 meters out down the road i'm watching the push on your tongue i'll do that i keep he's over here somewhere i broke the guy in the upper window i'm gonna die so one down downside once broke upper and one's in the lower one one down upper we're finished up though so then lower lower is the last one well dead i played didn't even get a chance to shoot and then tom you did the job oh i thought jack got it then i get a kill on the feet that would have been sick i'm gonna grab my loadout and then i'll come back over um have you seen the easter egg on the new french map jack nope oh what is it that's good i don't want to spoil it for you okay i'll uh send you a link after we're done unless you want to do it on stream but i'm sure you just want to do warzone today only takes five minutes how do you do it is it easy there's like a series yeah so easy okay yeah all the easter eggs yeah there's like five numbers on different corners of the new trench map um and you have to shoot the the numbers and sweet sequence on a keypad because you open a bunker which is like the war zone bunkers then inside there's like a little teddy bear meeting and various of the teddy bears have like they're like dressed to look like characters in call of duty like one has a boonie hat with a cigar in his mouth and then uh there's another code on a telephone and you enter that of the keypad then the phone rings you answer the phone and two big doors open and a massive teddy bear dressed as a juggernaut has two mini guns by his side just kills you all no yeah oh dude i've got to do a video on this it sounds amazing we have

it rain leaving money back there yeah i don't think it matters to me how the console looks to me it matters about what's inside it the specifications and also the games like i don't really care how a console looks because i don't look at it all the time usually it just goes under my desk or in a tv cabinet so i don't really care how much it looks you know some people will love it some people will hate it to me it's just a games console it's just the new playstation like it doesn't really doesn't really bother me are we going to go for one of these yeah let's do it i've not done one yet jack it's really we haven't done one yeah it's good so we'll we'll come over here launcher guaranteed neighborhood there's one guaranteed launcher i'm flying directly to us right oh it's actually way

that i had pushed the talk on my apologies it's okay yeah i was speaking to you the whole time and you were responding but just by chance yeah that was a crazy start guys i mean that's why i like downtown that's why i just like downtown it's too rng for me jack and i are going to have two different video titles completely polar opposites to one another downtown is amazing it sucks get rid of it worst thing yeah please nuke downtown jax will be where is the nuke going to land here's my suggestion i mean this will be the video guys because yeah it'll be a vod afterwards so you guys come up with there you go i've already got a title for it but i mean i'm hoping to change it if you think oh this is live youtube titling right now does that not affect the algorithm i am the algorithm is so drastic that's true i've got no idea tom i don't think anybody goes in the game this time there is a truck driving by and it's the king oh my god what a baller has he got the wifi wagon oh i'm gone i might be able to stick this jeep do it i'll do it did you get it and deplete so close i was trying to stick it i needed the perfect stick connor i see i see i don't think youtube knows how the youtube algorithm works no no that's definitely true no it's forever learning from itself yeah i'm getting some plates does the plate in the back of the one truck great there i think changes position he's so casual the way he says that yeah how do you get to this one he sounds a bit like johnny depp in in person yes that's it that is it he just sounds drunk just a position position he sounds drunk all the time my changing position okay i think you're exaggerating you sounded a bit michael caine then oh no i trusted mate but i found you guys the most feared pirate michael caine mike okay you have heard of me master wayne double reference here timer double reference like that yeah oh we have enough but you have all heard this guy's going down are you just lmg in that chopper yeah oh i'm down for that one's just logged in i don't think it's over i've got double md right now he's going for the roof he's i'm a bro he's safe armor there he goes there he goes there he goes mate oh a lot of drops down top loadout i know you're busy but i'm just letting you know so upset can we get munitions do you guys need ammo i've literally just fired 400 rounds of ammo so yeah i'm going to say i could probably use a little bit of ammo right now i could use a little bit there's so many there just the pirates of the caribbean theme team was playing whilst i was spraying them down do you need uh i can't risk it now with all the dmca twitch stuff oh we could just do our yeah rendition of it thanks i gotta be careful watch out for connor if it's too accurate jack is a man possessed with those knock your head off with them first before i can like put them down just for a little while what'd you say son i said we all heard your cardo ran impression what's to say that your impression of the pirates of the caribbean theme tune won't actually dmc strike my channel carl ren he just says his own name i would like all guns to fire on that man please that's in the last jedi when he's in the walker more more more more please sir can i have some more is this an enemy um i'm assassinating someone currently okay so you know that guy that i was spraying down before this is where he landed and i guess he gave up on life so i just just stood there afk i have eliminated a man i assume he thought he was dead before he died because i sprayed 400 rounds into his chopper there we go i don't know where everyone else is or if there's anyone else captain sparrow played by alan rickman wow that's my island okay he's crossing the left i don't know if he's oh my god there's a lot there's stuff here found it right he's very low i'm touching i don't know where he went watching me down different teams yeah behind us you got guys on youtube i got the team wipe here nice okay there you go that might be one more though no i don't think so are you not facing anyone else no on the right side no no because this guy was instantly like he died right off afterwards okay yeah that was it then that's that's so i think we i snuck up on the guy that was on the buy station he was part of this first squad they were fighting and then all right let's head back to buy station i don't know how we always get between teams there's never any any sounds like nobody's shooting each other right we're just really good at one shot and then teams just come out of the bushes how is their subtitles on a live stream uh youtube just does it automatically it transcodes it it doesn't get everything right though like if i speak really slowly it will do it you guys want anything plates maybe yeah i do have i didn't have in one plate i think i saw someone there i'm dead one down they're the trophy system on their vehicle that's small yeah that's the first time it's actually been used against me what's that because you're rpg we'll see no c4 okay yeah you just expect it to blow up and then you're like ah now i'm dead yeah inhale ah i actually use the trophy system oh there's a vector a silver fox nice all right all your stuff's here there's a loadout as well nearby i'm going to get the perks i was going deaf again what's 87 could you drop 300 yeah yeah thanks dude what are you buying oh i couldn't get self rest completely forgot yeah you can now as soon as i bought myself res that happened i'm just buying plates is the rest of the money thanks yeah the vector comes with the battle pass so does the galil you can get it for free i don't know what level it's on though i feel like making ninja sound effects while i'm using these things yeah yeah no because i want to try them no i'm scared of it i have a training session i don't like it who wants to duel white i'm ready hold on mortal kombat i'll see what all oh my god he's been training his whole life his power level's over 9000 wall jump he's invincible nothing's taking this man down you keep blocking each other you're that good yeah i need like uh he's a zen master oh it's all gone wrong why would you want to shoot people doing that trophy we gotta do this man we gotta get him with the sticks oh dude he's gone he's down he's finished i switched out my weapon as soon as we started getting it i was so ready for that that was yeah that's why i didn't realize you had sticks jack yeah i told him there might still be one left because that was a down and finish oh man jack you mad at me no he's actually on fronting here right now you need plates some guy on me thank you yes like these plates sorry he was gonna beat you i know there's another one on the roof for that small building i just can't see you i'm shooting one to the right of your barricade jack oh another one another one another one i just want to use the ninja sticks [Applause] next hut over from you jack two guys [Applause] all i want to do is be a ninja why can't they leave they just leave us alone there should be at least one over there because there's two teams fighting relocating i need to not peak first in and they can do that how much cash did you have connor i'd have been not mine wait tell him it's a sticker oh he's so lost did you say tell them it's your life it didn't yeah i'm so dead gotta believe the kimbo sticks all right no pressure he actually fully pushed you after all that yeah didn't think you would lw all right what's geralt rivera so you know he's a very experienced legendary witcher how could i ever win you didn't have your sticks that was the issue i needed the sticks i mean i i did hit that that guy once once yeah yeah but it didn't break i think those things attack faster than the axe so it might take three hits with those is it a yeah three hit kill makes sense doesn't it because your first was just armor you didn't break them right yeah just one hit didn't break armor yeah i swear the axe attacks a little bit slower that was a good attempt though for sure maybe we should be kilo 141 squad one of us goes alex and one of us goes ghost but captain price yeah but who's who's the leader here we're all leaders exactly so maybe also saying we all should be priced connor let's all be priced so be price have you got different skins of price i've got this one i only bought to level 85 i bought to the vector unlock i mean i say only that's that is most of the battle pass i like the first one i mean there's some really nice variants of it let's do a look at the uh the rewards after you've got level 100 you know if i just shot that guy he would have been a squad pipe no because the other guy had sulfuras right after all right yeah so you probably would have to fight him as well who knows yeah but he would have been on hp it's possible jack did go for the content you got it you got it you just have to you got to go for the clips can't be back real quick i wish i could assassinate someone whilst i'm free-falling do you remember in the original trailer there's a bit where i was saying this yesterday it's like uh when the parachute goes through yeah the skyscraper why can't i thought it was an in-game mechanic maybe that's so legit it would be amazing a fezzle i don't know what the error code is i i think a lot of people in the comments have said that there's an error code on console right now on xbox but i guess maybe that's just a problem with call of duty or xbox live or something pc is working fine for me so i don't know i don't know what to say sorry a male plays thank you for the two to one charade thank you for becoming a new member i appreciate that man thank you it's very kind to you a brock simpson thank you for the two just got a win with a nine millimeter m4 you know

what the hell and then your milk you drink the milk afterwards it's delicious we don't really have anything like that it's because we have food regulations here so the americans just crave is probably one of the nearest things that crave like pillows of like a pillow wheat snack with like chocolate or pillows yeah like you know oh they look so rpg me from that room there as well he has no way down right like his teammate would have to climb up i think he's stuck up there you want to see if he climbs up oh they're fighting well there's a choppy could just try clustering it i don't know how if

that quad over fine i've got this dude's plane growl this dude's playing ground plane ground it's just so boring it's got wings on it it's got it's just completely default skin with all the pro attachments wheelie [Music] yeah there's the wheelie how do you do that short shift no way hang on is this someone here it's a totally random moment i should have threw my trophy system on it yeah maybe that would have been a good idea i didn't even think well i thought you know it would be safe for the bike i don't know how to feel he's wishing middle kind of thank you hang on is that bang what i heard one footstep and immediately knew i thought i saw someone's shoulder so i said thank god this is what we all did yeah jack's final cool that was amazing okay i'm gonna go for my loadout drop because the helies are up okay yeah if you hold shift when you're on a quad makes you do a wheelie it's an actual feature it's a totally random moment was that horrible histories right i don't know where am i getting that from you're done it's just generic kids show isn't that i think yeah maybe i think since the hell he's out but everyone's kind of distracted so so we absolutely just kind of hovering around here it won't be a problem i don't believe so should we shoot this out or we don't have enough ammo to shoot it down dude ah that's the one there it is why did it go up at the last second is the game oh i hit it right now i'm out yeah i got the hit marker what if i pick it up i think it just gave me the kill no well um do you have a pistol we could pistol use your starter pistol but it's nearly dead it's nearly dead there we go yeah oh my god most wanted no i don't think so oh my look where it is oh that's landed right next to us i'm capping it somehow [Applause] okay it's all on the other side of course that's cash that is hard cash right there that's what we needed i'm gonna pop a uav now place here munitions box there we go wait i can't i couldn't pick that one up

he's down again he's got teammates uh i have to check two in order to do it are we gonna die if we do this maybe a little too thirsty though we still haven't got the money you couldn't do anything

get connor now we're gonna go um yeah different one different one the one that we previously died there's gonna be there's gonna be the same guy and he's gonna throw a c4 on the chopper we're gonna die and be eliminated it's a totally random moment yeah there we go look there he is oh no you you got your nade don't you still no ammo all right we'll leave that good lay under the roof [Music] missed our locking a lot of people just scare you with a missile locking thing and then you early flare you know do they yeah i've never had somebody do that just a lot of random moments in that one totally random moment it's a good attempt at a comeback yeah it wasn't bad right last game for me boys let's get the win all right sounds good there's a terminator 2 moment [Laughter] in [Music] i won't do the rest i'm sorry that was a good attempt it was a good attempt john dean thank you for the five why don't you ever play vr titles like half-life alex or fps like onward and pavlov um i'm kind of sick of vr for the moment john is the integrated suppressor deadpool for the vector better than no it doesn't like actually i think it is for warsaw yeah you think it's better yeah yeah i prefer it just my preference though um i i get sick really easily from vr games and i don't like having to set everything up i've had so many problems with it glitching out i think i'll revisit vr when it's all completely wireless and i can just wear a pair of glasses on my face i think you know it's only then that it's going to be really mainstream i mean there are some great experiences to be had with vr no doubt like half-life alex i watched lyric play that and it was brilliant but for me i'd rather play it in 2d a shane thank you for the turn a store by my house sells five pound bags of just marshmallows from the lucky charms we're fat here you need the cereal though to balance it a chronos thank you for the one and the two uh christian path what's up man thoughts on war zone rumbles i don't like it it's it's not war zone it's not br i think they could have done a lot better with it but joe neves thank you for the two and dynamic d please tell your mates thanks for being a light for people during these dark times no problem dynamic thank you i appreciate that ideal next battlefield theater modern warfare it's gotta be near future or modern warfare homie sounds like a computer ai voice is that true max that would be a shame what's up sneaker daily hello what's up vic prashant d all right jack it's your turn how are you doing also yeah i'm gonna play the last super spot too okay okay okay okay some action with quarry really okay the farther out you go like edge of the map or the things that you would look for i think are more safe but yeah a lot more players tend to go for it stick together stick together lots of people in my uh comments are saying that there's an error at the moment with the game like if you haven't already got it open you can't play games yeah that's what i'm getting as well i think we're lucky wait what do you mean they can't play warzone at the moment can't log in yeah if you're not already logged in oh okay people are getting uh server cues yeah was it just straight up again error code like 8 000 something i don't know see the trick is just never log out 1892 i think they turned the memes up too high so no one can log in yeah how's it going on me okay i'm falling back we're coming to you yeah there's also people here always chasing i'm in trouble going down good cover thank you here jack he said two those are my ripped one cheers he is communicating with his team there's people on blue behind us on the roof pp19 at that distance it's hardly worth shooting is it it's not too bad once you fully deck that thing out people keep telling me anyways have you tried it omozone of i think i tried it once but i felt like it was a little bit weak yeah yeah i picked one up earlier in it i felt because i thought it had a faster fire rate than what it did [Music] can't get on the roof here can you dude he's falling off was he getting shot up by somebody else as well i not sure i don't think so the roof again nice job there's no ladder above your head connor killed them off as well i want to go for the contract yeah let's get our loadouts that's safe i feel like we spend the majority of the beginning of the match just fighting people and then having no money oh this guy up here top level it's fun though isn't it top level yeah i don't mind yeah i think he was on his own maybe oh heartbeat uh west what is this i think he's running to the buy station no there isn't a buy station he's like here somewhere still detectable oh he's close on me oh no oh dear it's all gone wrong oh no green bean down them oh nice for the con i ate yeah i got you sorry um there you go yeah you were fixing that really when you're too close to the wall you can't revive please let me just throw his team maybe here we go i really don't want to push it out but i can back you up now i mean i've only got one play but yeah we bit light on plates aren't we yeah also light on ammo did you finish um do you want something just you've got something uh i'll drop it down here thank you oh gosh no i didn't get that we can get loaded out we can get a little or did i um yeah do you want to hit the buy or get the contract let's get a buy we servers are up now apparently uh ziad is that right i gotta start using the carnegie more i thought it's great dude yeah still stand by it it's so quiet too mm-hmm i mean i don't like the sound of it suppressed but it is definitely super quiet it's an efficient sniper yes full show drop in two places oh he's back again again captain slice is it that loud captain slice is back at it captain slice that's a good captain slice that's right let's make captain schloss guys where are your nunchucks get that where are your nunchucks been playing this game on my iphone recently it's called fruit ninja i'm amazed now i just realized that i'm being hunted always haunted jack but where from single threat everyone wants a piece of jack oh it went down let me yeah i'll get this beat this beat this uh drop the b recon drone they're in here somewhere yeah all three of them but on that painting why did that not hit why did that not hit just scooched over didn't it that would have been a triple kill i bet there's two in this building actually where the third one i saw him for a second did they go back in yeah yeah uh one's on the back side actually no one's outside and one's here recon drone [Music] distracted by me now because i've ate it i still think i'm he's gonna be top left window i don't see him peeking it no hit i left my drone and he was just right in front of me the third guy it's two in there just one guy i mean i i downed and then i killed a guy initially and then this was the second guy that was an insta this looks clear up here okay so i killed a random guy on the hill as soon as i left my drone there was a guy 10 meters in front of me all right all right i was throwing in a bush though so i managed to damn i really wanted to use the nunchucks there um couldn't use my dead silence a little too soon you guessed some of the bye again yeah we got ourselves rez's [Applause] hello because a spanish woman actually she sounded like quite young she's kind of like the the one i killed on the oh on the green thing she sounded like the girl in wolverine oh yeah in logan she just started screaming spanish at me it was like that scene in the in the truck that movie is heartbreaking man i can't watch this yeah but it's so good it's very good yeah it's one of the best comic book movies ever truly um self resist boys i need a bit of cash casually running right by it don't mind me i saw at the center man i bought the blu-ray but i can't bring myself to watch it again it's worth having on blu-ray at least unless you have it there for the day that you forget and then you watch it and then you're like okay i'm never watching it again why did i trust my judgment i mean it's sad but like you you really appreciate how good it is it's yeah i love cinematography as well and that's one of the most beautifully shot movies i've seen in a while they added like effects to his face and stuff did you ever read about that yeah yeah the uh it was so well done they uh fully masked uh hugh jammin's face onto him yeah there's sometimes when he's like entirely cgi head you just don't notice yeah he spoke about it i went to see his uh his live show then if you heard about the jack in the uk i went to see i bought um my stepmom and my dad tickets to it it was such a great show but he did talk about wolverine and stuff what does he do in the show like magic tricks um no it was uh it was all it was like a musical so he did like all right he's singing yeah he did uh all the greatest things from a great showman and um they is rob it's really good actually yeah my step my stepmom's a big fan [Applause] uh where would he go yellow house on the right i guess park is on yeah that's kind of what i'm thinking too he's not on beat you're so idle oh full team over there that's him yeah they just don't know him but it's definitely a full team i think over to the right moving moving and i've got a trophy system i do look how fast connor is with those sticks oh they've seen me on the bridge jeez i've done a lot of armor damage okay i'm pushing up location [Music] i'm clustering them so please don't cluster myself just down that guy rpg to my left one down two down then finished one's outside this way broke him story below me nice smackdown you got him with the sticks oh my god i'm gonna call the story after the break or legend yep lovely i mean i was also attacking him so fast i actually have no idea three times probably only one i just loads of people can't log in at the moment are you it's just an error so i just guess wait until they fix it keep trying oh yes perfect timing by yourself oh i'm broke oh no never mind because we could have bought uh i can't afford anything that's hilarious oh my god we've got no money we sell freshers don't we well i need a job just let's leave these buildings quick might be something around if we haven't bought ourselves reservoirs you won't believe these prices i have two dollars pennywise in there wait there's a satchel i didn't pick up these things there's no money guys it's all been lured i'm sorry we're ruined yeah the one thing that we could have got for free we bought earlier so first something was just straight hundred percent i see let's see pop a wheelie jack so what just hold shift it's not new yep no it's been in the game no yeah that's always been in the game [Music] oh my god speed it's hard to do so if you slow down and hit it again you'll do like a really [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah there you go they don't be able to see what a great fire style that was guys all the things that we bought so we just need a third one then here go get that one if you reverse a bit and then do it oh where is the new tunnel [Music] have you been through it yeah i've been through it i haven't been through it either i don't know if we can oh wasn't it like i think it's outside the map is that big hill it's here [Music] it's green ping but um oh that's gonna be out yeah sounds gonna update so i'm gonna control tom with the sticks left okay right [Laughter] [Music] bye sad laughs ah it needs like a really good sound effect though just a cane why are you doing this to me okay so where to what's the plan here i don't know the joke on track maybe if there's one nearby [Music] it's relatively nearby new tunnels by the hospital [Music] whoa okay i started to fly yeah you lose control if you do it how have i never known this was in the game this whole time you know what you're not the first person a lot of people have said that i mean i was getting shot in the back then by the way i don't know if it was the healer i learned from yeah they're trying to c4 i disabled it no way i don't know how one behind me the other guy's at the truck behind you down the road on the left i'm in the gulag boys i am so downed [Applause] [Music] i don't see the guy i'm shooting at that's fun okay uh all the way down all the way down i just don't know who himself there's one at the pole behind you yeah he's soft oh i'm being shot from another team across the way have you all gone survive they can yeah did you finish honey no they're all still alive i got yelled sulphur's yeah actually i didn't think i got a finish you just straight up i got killed by the truck uh center left center left still center right center right oh he was so quick dude he said center right as he was right in front of my face i'm gonna get sniped in the head here where's that going enemy uav overhead could you not get your um self res off connor where you were i mean i could have but he would have just down me again yeah that's why i was trying to get away and then use it yeah they're staying on the other side of the river all right you got this corner you might be better off doing a fly contract yeah there's one right in front of me should i come down to your do you want me to go for the contract uh land on the lag if you can connor i can't get up there the flag yeah right above me you can't you can't grab it i mean i i could but you'd have to go off go up there [Music] just thinking because the kill uh the king guy was like right there let's move oh we're in downtown now your favorite place least favorite place oh someone has a contract right here yeah vic's not fun either zak said he wants it to get nuked new good news too let me grab this box real quick i mean this is such a dodgy flag to cap but whatever it's gonna be someone right he just runs at everyone today and uh [Music] he's 300 meters away and he's like just what just woke the squad boys come grab some loot there you go oh i heard him break glass here yeah 500 off and the only buy station is out but don't prioritize my life get placed and stuff if you need to eliminate the bounty target i think you went up the stairs should we just try and find a bit of money and then yeah let's do that get tom back oh there's a guy up on this roof well we only need 500 easier said than done though isn't it come on we can do it we can find that cash there's a box here this someone's in front of me here there you go you got the money do you need help on me he's just there i'm going to come back to you let's get to get to the point get to the bottom [Music] i got one i'll gladly take it thank you do you want to fight these guys well we need to if i drop you cash here here's another one thank you me cash yeah because you've got more players than him there's three ones either south or right above us yeah they're right he's above us is there another bar we could get to i mean you could sneak it and then just run away i have dead the other guy killed himself he killed himself yeah he jumped off the roof right here jack just turned on beast mode real quick so that's fine yeah i saw that absolute legend over here it's a loadout drop there there's a team shooting on that kilo one four one hdr lovely what is this here tom you want an mp7 or are you good um nice work jack please open your eyes with the door for a second in there they'll just rush you they're thick there's a couple custom guns here yeah it's got a kilo what is that across there man how is this custom in any way yeah some of these guns are weird i could buy some more plates quickly yeah there go for it yes i'll drop money as well if you want to get some more bit more for more plates okay gas guys there you go you good i guess i'm going out to be a downtown engine didn't it just had to be yeah your favorite place we could probably make it for that ludo maybe there was a squad over there okay they were the base of this building on green position or we could fight for tallest buildings that's how he sounds today what about it those movies are great elegance it's so good apart from the fourth one the fourth one is pretty strange the last one was hmm are we done bro dad or karma yeah nice oh he's dead he's just dead simple build is horrid what is this scope dude the ads speed on this guy's growl like i could run downstairs grab a bottle of water and run back up and it just be about finished uh behind us where we were right here it's not even suppressed where did he go i think he just kept running we running this in teamwork yeah i guess we're gonna have to gus is in yeah get back in the the town maybe but there should be a team off to a right somewhere you guys cleared the ground floor of this don't you oh yeah yeah might be someone there now looks good let's just chill here for a second is there someone on this tower there was right yeah yeah i think he went up anyone a heartbeat oh contract well done there's 18 players left heart beats on bank you ready for the snipe time if he picks it's double bond just double body shot him he bakes easy that's not good well they will have to jump off and eventually hopefully this circle comes to us i don't like that bus like he's not very good cover no it's not either we should cross over the bank and i don't know we can take ground floor because we're gonna be pushed out in the open here at some point take ground floor banks maybe if we can't make it to bank queen just chill here let's go shoot on me now he's right the other one's hurt too you taking shots from somewhere else there he's shooting me from the ladder on the bank on the bank like here oh you just opened the door he's just jumped off he might be on this level i want to jump again there's probably one team in this building and then one on top one jumped right here it's going back towards us guys yep get ready to cross back over one down i've got one down on roof one i'm holding this door on your left on your left rpg's me point blank down it's all pressed up to your left one there so president double down he's been rpg'd another guy reviving on me right now no eyes
