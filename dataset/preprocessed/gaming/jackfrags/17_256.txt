hi everyone and welcome to far cry 6 big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one and let me get hands on with the game are they they baby chickens dude just chill it's baby chickens oh my god aren't they the cutest thing you ever did see cow look after those chicks so i've gotta head over here to find a legendary mercenary who apparently is going to help us revolutionize the island and overturn ghost spring from breaking bad he's up to no good [Laughter] so you want to humiliate the army all by yourself idiota you're never satisfied how dare you i do everything you want and this is how you thank me what the legendary mercenaries of rooster what do you want i'm fine with it yeah it's okay no i followed him over here you're more of a strong squawking type i see and not a big fan of evil dogs apparently locked of course apparently there's some dogs in here that have been brainwashed and chicaron wants to get in there they work for the military and there's guapo my pet crocodile just just just go with it guapo's in chicago are you going in or what guapo needs a bit of backup here check around come on a rottweiler versus a rooster have you ever seen something how about some fire fire's always good spice things up a bit you know oh my i've set guava on fire grapple i'm sorry come here my bad it's okay he's not happy about that i'm afraid the rooster's been overrun by dogs i now set chicken run on fire as well please calm down i think that's it he's fine he's fine he was never the same but now i can trust he has found a companion who will protect him on his quest for justice oh no protection he's [ __ ] terrifying [Music] why did the civilian park right in front it's just this is normal far cry it's fine this is what i've come to expect it's all right okay now i think i've got to put some graffiti somewhere up there okay i don't know why the rooster is demanding that i graffiti everything but [Applause] i i'm scared of it so i'll just do whatever it says okay so the rooster wants me to put his name everywhere and it can read listen i'm just going to do what the rooster says all right what are you doing it's just the box that's what i'm gonna do why it's just a man selling fruit and vegetables now he's just terrorizing everyone i get it those parts are my life now he's off again it runs like naruto found some soldiers oh that's brutal i mean that's a velociraptor right that's not a rooster i suppose they are based off dinosaurs aren't they i wonder if that place even has records of castillo's war crimes i can help with this i think maybe chicaron was a bit close to the explosion there we going in here how was my day well i followed a bloodthirsty rooster into combat after he blew up a truck and a crocodile i think you should knock [Applause] [Music] chickaron could use some help destroying the files how does the brewster even know that this is a government building roosters don't have that mental capacity do it not that i've ever known the rooster maybe they are not smart dude oh he just kicked him in the face what he's got i think he's just destroying all the files i can help with this [Music] all right that's like the uh the third time that i've set chickaron on fire i do apologize chickaron are we done no there's some more there this will help won't it it seems to be immune as well i i don't know i feel like the roots got god mode or something i quite like this thing the steak goes it's good let's get him grapple whoa that rag doll man the fires have been destroyed no survivors it was a bit of a bloodbath to be honest yeah right where are we going now best view is from the roof okay we gotta go up he wants me to do more graffiti i think on there there you go mate some more small rooster graffiti that it can apparently read just likes the colors i think that's what it is i mean that's a big one that would have took me a long time oh no no not again the people are genuinely fearful of this thing is that is that necessary you just destroyed this man's world oh my god we're off again we're going again oh is it sniffing what is it what did that mom do for you uh it just kills random wildlife now as well poor little mongoose oh [Music] is it stealth attack why don't i shoot this chickaron come back getting too far from the objective i think the objective is getting too far from me failed you having a laugh all right let's try again maybe i shouldn't have shot the explosive barrel it was a one-hit kill that time oh you do it anyway right so it can read and it knows how to blow things up using barrels keep chica run alive while he wrecks the monument i can do that he's just standing there and taking it i've got some rockets yeah oh that definitely helped i've set my arm on fire great have some of that mate molotov cocktail yes ow i love how i was shot multiple times there and just pulled one bullet out i think chicago performs more effectively when i'm saying on fire so i can drag this guy here look at this force look at this they just don't care about me either they're just so focused on chicken [ __ ] all adorable noises bye i think i was on one hp then well there's only a few left [Music] yes we did it [ __ ] on yes we destroyed the monument now we're going to make it our own choker on we'll rule these lands chicharron wants you goddamn right sure it does yeah it's a velociraptor did i get that big in real life i've never seen the roost that big although i haven't really seen that many roosters so i don't know can i pet you no not nice all right it doesn't doesn't like to be bed but choose your own versus a horse come on get him oh super attack oh my god the horse kicked him off go get them on kill go oh you missed that was an easy one no oh actually okay check on just pick that dude's eyes out i feel like it could turn on me on a moment's notice right i'm gonna leave it there thank you for watching me and chica on i'm going for a swim we're gonna go and see
