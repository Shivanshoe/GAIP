hi everyone we're gonna just test something here so apparently you can blind fire grenades but we've never seen it so we're just kind of working out how to do that right now Jack I'd like to don't get out don't get it out I know what you want to do parently its hold up get gun out hold out like hold so you're looking around the corner here like this yeah let your guns going so big so the guns around the corner here yeah no I need you that I'll do that say that to my around it doesn't look like you're holding around the corner does it no face face this way though isn't it face face the wall then do it that's it hey what yeah you just look at the doll look flushed go flush to the door yeah now look at me now duo and s you bend it around the corner that's that's it sort of your whole guy turns they wait when you fire where's that gonna go oh I hit the box in that room but wait look when I do it I can actually make it so my arms go look that right yeah your character just turn to face the cook to face it all right little man I fire let's just hit with our boxes yeah it just looks like you're looking grunt yeah it doesn't look like you're bending around the corner all right now try throw the grenade around that is definitely round the corner right yeah and now you press G don't you want to move back a bit now we'll just wait this new weapons yeah it did go around the corner I love how it literally just instantly it literally jumps out of your hand like a Mexican jumping bean it's mad I mean anyone you could do that very effectively I think without exposing yourself oh I pretend to be a scout a lot like a tire I've had other people kind of walk around like this like just like strafing or looking cuz if this is a scout isn't they I if you just do with like movements like this stacked like look off into the distance of them just straight foot into the direction you want to go people don't shoot you sometimes because they don't want to alert the scraps I swear I'm not a real human so who terror group their name pops up all the time well they seem to run the lab so I guess in the law there some kind of responsible for a virus of some kind yeah I'm gonna make a bit of noise here but you have to breach it yes it was a CPU let me in instead of Intel that's worth that's worth money guys is it worth taking this sick graphics card yes definitely it's worth up to the 50k it's like an asus strix isn't it okay I see a guy on the other side of the river by the bridge she was running there's two of them together so it's a group oh yeah they just running away from us now see am i soon I will show the scope-1 I don't see them cuz we want to cross so I just liked it but did they leg it to go to the boat by the fire cuz they could be here let's just walk did they go to customers by their gunshot this game gives me Daisy nostalgia look so much like it sometimes couldn't really tell what they were wearing from that distance didn't look that geared the guy that I looked up did you what have you got well just the insights but just based on you know his silhouette it didn't look like he was chunky I could just saw a guy on the opposite window okay get in here he crossed he's it that well coming up is he in our building at him yes I just saw one bodies close got my son poor girl I'm gonna close that door why he was at the end of the corridor he went into the stairwell so he's either on the stairs sitting there waiting he's in the room to the left hang on he's like the room he's Andy of the dorms yeah I'm gonna push John and get into the middle I saw I definitely saw a guy run past so he could have gone lower oh god the danger is so real could be out on the roof there these two rooms here are clear so if you stand here while I unlock this door

gun to you yeah they have a decent gun yeah oh my god I'll fight it fast don't worry is keep an eye on me in the corridor and I'll see if I can find it okay he's tucked in on the left in the big open space he's just camping you in a room no in the large open space off the corridor it's time to I'm right by sit down I'm ready for war I believe that okay here [Music] got him I think another player walked in and kill him then I killed the play that walked in guys that now you need me to be the man in the chair and taught you down he's got an attack to backpack its massive check out these guns then examine all the things that one looks really nice oh the UI stuck on my screen Adam well man how do you get rid of that can you move to any website I don't think you get rid of it suppose I could just leave it on the side of the screen if it's small but it's about half the screen and I can see the center of my screen Zack you can't play like that but a player this right so can you guide me I can but let's cut the thing up in the middle Youth great yes well that's half the screen okay cross the dorms moving to go towards the Knicks dorm but don't don't go into it go past it and then get into the forest in front of you okay I'm going to pass the dorm keep walking forward you'll see a train track I see trains yeah and a train track yeah there so you gonna cross over that try and track and then keep going forward so I want to go right yeah across the train track yep this is heading up towards that big pile on yeah yeah that's where that's where we're going because I'm taking you through the back of the forests okay rather than going through like the wood the roads and stuff I'm a big gate like like a checkpoint gate yeah you through that gate and then follow me nice to my stomach you got about three minutes the escapes not far but you've got a cross and get into the next compound because it's so annoying dude won't leave me alone I'm just kind of run that footstep okay kill the guy that was under me nice hold on no need to heal online man this stupid bug can't catch so any of the menus and if you go in the way I think they'll be like there's probably a road to your left I see okay I'm at the exit okay you open opened the corrugated iron door going down going down and careful cuz people camp inside yeah I've been here before I know this one clear okay just better to get out with what you got the be greedy that bug is that book is so gay not an iceberg who made it we may need it well you made it but as a team we made it I sacrificed myself time just for the Intel these are always gonna die because there was absolutely nothing I could do to keep myself alive what is happening she didn't have any food well because my stomach had been destroyed Jack yeah but there must be a way to come back from that yeah there is but it's an item called a surgery kick and you have to perform surgery on yourself and give yourself a new stomach [Music] [Music]
