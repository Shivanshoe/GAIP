guys i'm really sad i just ordered a latte with cream and they gave me the latte but they didn't give me the cream it's unforgivable really isn't it so i thought to try and alleviate my sadness i'd play some battlefield one uh will it work i don't know maybe i found this flamer kit it's already getting a bit spicy in here isn't it four hp i was on then for hp and i think this is cappareto yeah that's right look at those gas grenades coming down waters that's awesome so this was one of the last maps that they added to the game i didn't really play it that much the only thing i did was like bomb people with the moronettes just because it was so open roadkill roadkill oh the medic how do you survive that oh god i think something is attacking me the vehicles in this game are so slow what if we get around here let's try we get some roadkills up in here all right let's yes [Music] i'm stuck are you kidding me dice how did i how did i get stuck there [Music] die it's barbecue time boys you're dead okay so you do regenerate health with this class it's just it takes ages it's really really slow i want my vehicle back there and that was cool getting those roadkills oh there is someone down here look hi mate i'm not sure flames are good for this map because it's kind of long range at the start right but it's working right so far you don't get a secondary weapon either yeah it's all all about the grenades and the flames the grenades and the flames it's working out all right [Music] you can't hide this sorry here's some heels i'll take those does that work yeah that works ow someone just shot me in the head you know what i'm gonna go down here someone jumping out of a plane yeah look oh that's a hot landing right there that's hot that's hot i want this vehicle here i can't believe i'm staying alive this long hopefully i don't get it stuck this time oh is this one already stuck it's kind of stuck can i get out of this trench come on guys we can do it how do vehicle physics work wouldn't even fit in here no that's i think we're ruined i don't think we're gonna get it out unless unless we can turn it oh no come on ah i don't think it's gonna happen lads rest in peace maybe there's a horse that i can jump on i have taken that point behind us i always you know well i think one of the biggest missed opportunities with this game was you can't put more than one person on a horse how good would that be if you could have one person riding the horse and then the other on the back just chilling now you could do it unofficially right like you could like ride on the horse by just getting on the back of it but you're not really on it you just fall off every now and again that's one of the biggest missed opportunities with this game you have one person with a machine gun or you know whoa that horse a flame drawer dude those animations are so good aren't they they are so damn good i got myself a horse instead being a flamethrower guy is difficult on these streets you know it's not as easy as you think for being a horse simple please grenades get up yes okay now the point of this video was supposed to be using oh my god dude put that put that club down i was supposed to be using this the lee enfield silence so i've switched to it and we're going to be using this for the rest of the gameplay i almost died then who shoot me in the back is it you is that your head is that a head i think that's the head that's unfortunate that's a medic oh my god that movement is so unpredictable all he was doing was strafing around with his syringe out and i just couldn't hit that guy that dude has some sick moves to be fair we've got to push back up the hill now because they've taken all our points cheeky sniper on the wall there okay oh oh the nose go back here is insane in this game it really is beautiful love the sound of this man sounds awesome doesn't it whoa what is that rockets from a plane or something beautiful where are these guys up here yes oh it's satisfying it's really satisfying oh oh oh horse horse horse horse please horse horse go away horse go away be gone you're not a horse you're a horse yes we defeated the final boss of horses who's doing that there's a couple guys here one's got a machine gun hello down here dead okay right so we have taken the points back they've got our back points again we should get back down there damn this game is fun so cinematic as well two lads here medic i want you i wasn't finished there's another one yeah beautiful kill oh god oh i couldn't jump up and down enough to dodge the bullets that dude had a sick dog tag though did you see that that was great no that was my kill oh my god the plane dude's on the anti-air dice dice this is a real problem i was going to say that i swear like three of those shots should have hit well the round's nearly over it's quite a short one had a lot of fun though so what we'll do is we'll play the next map whatever it is oh god no no no no no no that's a grenade okay round over what are we going for passion dale or som everyone's going passion down all right we'll play that then okay passchendaele and this is the true world war one experience right here it's the true world war one capture the point lads that's it that's it about lewis gun dude looks like batman hey birdman yes we've got the cavalry here look at this look at this so good oh my god i'm feeling it the atmosphere nailed it they absolutely nailed it didn't they oh that was lucky he was just spotted through the smoker there's a horse there as well i need ammunition oh yeah i remember on this map the germans blended so well don't they of course they do because they've got a dark red uniform right but very difficult to see them at times how good is this come on it's just good isn't it it just looks incredible that's one of their scouts oh come on horse couple easy kills here i don't know what these guys are doing they just stood there i'm sure there were tanks on this level as well aren't there where's their tank i'm not seeing it yet oh my god look at the mini map there's so many there there's loads of people here what the hell i mean i think blending really well too don't they to be fair i go all the way over here this could be quite a nice sniping spot i'm on their flank here if i could actually like spot people but he's blending so well you just go prone i'm gonna get in there why not let's push in a sword player here and another one here [Music] that's a miss that's a hit no headshot though i could have lined that one up better couldn't what's on here are these medics oh i think he tried to yeah he threw a smoke down to try and hide himself that was cool beautiful i've got some kind of assignment there didn't i how the hell was that yes any more on this side oh i think i'm screwed can i get that kit what is that oh i've got one bullet left i need a kit i need someone's kit give me a kit medic can i please get that i'm just running around trying to find a kit trying to pick one up i needed more secondary ammo that was epic though i love that i switched to the peacekeeper as my secondary because i feel like i could have lined up some headshots there if i had a different gun rather than the 1911 i just kind of spammed it oh good kill find or something plus the peacekeepers got all sorts of cool animations on it it's just awesome i've got to watch out for their tank though here it is finally we meet there's another one wasn't it got him [Music] i get the k bullet kill with the tank did we do it we actually did it i just said it for a laugh i wasn't expecting it to happen that's awesome okay right let's see what he looks like although they've got c hello buddy i saw you there boom call me revolver ocelot oh no no oh my god that's a it's a barbecue going on right there he's dead yeah surely mortars over here where are you that's a nice little spot there isn't it all right mate you want more to know more ow machine gun where it was you wasn't it oh my god the crossbow launcher he got revenge from beyond the grave to be fair that's really well played who uses that though not many people pick that i set myself on fire then didn't i i'm dead i am so dead well the rain is really coming down now sounds great on my headset very atmospheric he's beating someone to death down there now some people actually put rain sound effects on to sleep they'll just find a youtube video which is like eight hours of rain sound effects tonight helps them get to sleep it's not for me if i have rain sound effects on in the background
