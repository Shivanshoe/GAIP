this is the car 98k sniper rifle in hell let loose only two of these are allowed on the server at any one time two out of 100 players its power and killing potential is unrivaled in this game and today i'll be joining my spotter tommy as we attempt to push the allies out our summary demand our tactics are initially to provide sniper support for our team as we assault the town outskirts and then we're to move to the east of braycor manor finally pushing far north and attempting to get into a trench line here providing rear flanking opportunities to the battery now this game was by far the best sniper game i've had on hell let loose i don't get to play it that often but when i do i try to take advantage of it and there are a total of 71 confirmed kills here it was an absolute blast myself and tommy were being a nuisance and i hope you guys enjoyed watching this if you do leave a like and subscribe for more let's take a look at what happened in their rooms you know i'd say gopro
