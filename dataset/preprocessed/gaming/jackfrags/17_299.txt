so here's the plan then you get yourself an m13 you put yourself a thermal hybrid scope on it get some smoke grenades and make sure that you've got restuck on as a perk and then the idea is before you get in a firefight or before you start shooting at someone you throw down a smoke you stand inside the smoke or behind it you aim down the site you use that thermal and you shoot people who literally can't see you it's the best plan ever how can it fail obviously this isn't a meta loadout but it's a really fun way to play warzone and when you've got your entire squad doing this it's an absolute blast it can be alright laughs playing this way but today i was trying this out with study tactical brit and westy i was the only one in the squad doing it but it was actually quite effective at times and in this game you're going to see some absolutely nuts moments where stud was on a bike i was on the back and we were trying to hit people with the strela mid-air as well as trying to get smoke m13 thermal kills so it was just just a mad game really all around and i think you guys will really like watching this one if you do hit that like button below thank you and as always cheers to all these absolute legends for using my code in the cod store you're the best with that said let's get into the action now enjoy realistically though can they be italy yes yeah yeah italy italy's like any team
