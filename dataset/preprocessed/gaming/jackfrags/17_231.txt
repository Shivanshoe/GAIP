it's only five days until the battlefield 2042 beta goes live and i am very excited for this i know a couple days ago dice released the beta trailer for the game and that's got myself and a lot of people hyped i know that the sentiment in the community has been really positive since that video most people excited to jump in there and today we did get a new update for the game and this is talking about anti-cheat which obviously that's a great thing that dice are focusing on here fair play positive play and mouse and keyboard support for console it was quite a long article that was released but i'm just going to take a look at the highlights here for you the most important parts in my opinion so dai said that fair play is something that they take seriously within battlefield and that means that they don't tolerate cheating and they now have teams dedicated to preventing identifying and sanctioning cheaters so in bf2042 their first approach to ensure fair play is that they'll be using easy anti-cheat easy entity has already got a proven track record in identifying cheetahs such as winning apex legends and star wars squadrons it's also proven to be effective in ensuring your privacy and security i've got easy anti-cheat installed on my pc i use it for a couple of different games i also know that they use it in fortnite and i never hear about cheaters in fortnight so i think that bodes well for battlefield i've heard about more cheaters in apex of course they use different engines battlefields on the frostbite engine so every implementation of it i feel is going to be different and there's always going to be cheaters especially on pc but as far as i know i've done a little bit of research into this easy entity is a kernel level anti-cheat to some degree and they're supposed to be one of the best solutions that you can have at the moment but the posts actually went further into detail about this and i wasn't expecting this they said that another change for battlefield 2042 is that due to cross-play functionality when a cheater is sanctioned it will cause them to be instantly disconnected mid-match and permanently banned across all platforms as before we still have the ability to apply ip and hardware bands if necessary to keep our community a fair place we have a no tolerance rule in place there are no warnings and no suspensions when it comes to cheating if you don't play by the rules you're out that's interesting to me because although dice never explicitly said this for a fact with bf5 and bf1 there were rumors and chats in the community that they didn't apply a permanent ban first time and that's perhaps why there were more cheaters in those games there's no evidence of that but that was a common idea for those games but now with 2042 it looks like they're going to take a much harsher stance on it i'm all for that and i think crossplay especially you don't want to ruin your largest player base because although 2042 is going to be super popular on pc there's no shadow of a doubt that the console players will absolutely eclipse the pc players massively in terms of numbers and then after that lastly ensuring fair play and combating modern cheating solutions is an ongoing commitment that doesn't end at launch while not always visible to you as a player this means that post launch will continue to invest in developing internal capabilities and technologies augment third-party attitude solutions providing multiple layers of defense ensuring that our games are fair and fun for everyone so that to me sounds like the easy anti-cheat isn't the only thing they're going to use here there'll be a couple of other layers on top and developing internal capabilities perhaps dice are working on their own antique solution here as well cod have recently announced that they're doing that for call of duty warzone and vanguard going forward from launch when they come out so maybe dice are taking a similar stance here and making their own solutions too easy anti-cheat will be in place for the open beta from the 6th of october to the 10th and for the full release of bf2042 this november 6th of october to the 10th originally the dates were the 6th to the 9th so i don't know if this is a mistake or they're just planning on extending it a day to the 10th i'm not going to complain about that it's an ongoing struggle really but the fact that they're using easy anticheat and maybe they're working on their own thing plus the fact that this is a 60 game and they're doing ip bands and they're doing hardware bands it's not like in warzone where it's free to play and you can just get another account really easily if someone cheats and they get hardware banned ipvanned they're looking at a very expensive solution to actually come back and play the game again so i'm positive that cheating won't be a big issue in this game fingers crossed but we'll have to wait and see i mean we could even see cheese in the open beta i'm sure that's gonna happen i just hope that dice are on top of this and they're taking care of it like they say they will and then here console mouse and keyboard support a lot of members of the community have been asking about this we've heard your questions about mouse and keyboard support for consoles we can confirm that we won't be supporting this on console at the launch of bf2042 but we're still investigating the various options about making that available and how it may impact cross play if that ever changes you'll hear from us first that to me sounds like they're not gonna do it there's a chance but perhaps not a lot of other games do support mouse and keyboard natively on console modern warfare black ops cold war warzone vanguard there's a lot of other shooters that do it too but battlefield here it seems like they've decided not to go down that route and the other interesting part of this post is about reporting i don't know if this has been a problem on console in the past for battlefield games because they've never had cross play you can't use blatant cheats on console like wall hacks and aimbots but in previous battlefield games on pc especially bf1 bf5 it's been quite difficult to report people there wasn't an easy way to do that just in the game and you had to have the origin overlay on and then make sure you click on their profile it was like six clicks before you can actually report someone but in 2042 they've made this a lot easier and there's several options here too so you would just go to the player and squad list or the social menu select the player you want to report click report and then you pick the reason so we've got abusive text chat abusive voice chat cheating exploiting gameplay sabotage offensive player name and harassment so it should be a lot easier to report people to and it says that if you report a cheater they'll let you know in game that they've received that message and if they take action based on a report that you make you'll get an email saying the action was taken on that particular player or cheater so at least then you know that something has happened it's not just screaming into the void which it does feel like sometimes you'll also have the option to block or unblock players in game that means that they can't message or voice chat with you it doesn't look like there's any way to block matchmaking with a certain player though and this is something that's really great in modern warfare and warzone you can block individual players up to 200 i think that's the limit right now and if you start matchmaking and join a lobby and a blocked player on your list joins it will tell you and say hey this lobby has got a block player in it and then you can make the informed decision do you want to stay in or leave and this was a great way to block cheaters people who have been abusive or sabotaging the game and also for myself as a content creator i know i'm the 0.000 but it was a great tool that i could use to stop the stream snipers and people that i knew were 100 cheating so if i queued and i got into their lobby again which did happen a lot because it's got aggressive skill based matchmaking i would know to re-cue go in a different lobby instead it doesn't seem that 2042 will have that but i think it'd be a great system to implement because it does work really well you'll also have the option to mute the text chat you can mute the whole thing or you can mute individual players this is only really a problem on pc though consoles don't have the text chat and most people are playing with a controller anyway they won't have a keyboard plugged into their console but in my opinion i think text chat on pc should be off by default and players should opt into it rather than it just being there straight away so with that said that's all for today interesting that they went into a bit more detail on anti-cheat they've not really done that before but i think maybe there's a bit of confidence here that eac will work well touchwood we'll wait and see let me know your thoughts down below guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed the vid
