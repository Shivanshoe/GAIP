told me never to go in there we do what we please boy no excuses we do what we please can i have my bow back now can you hit it from here it's too far we should get closer [Music] at least the boy knows i went hunting with mother a bunch of times he never wanted to take me why not it was her wish and it was time okay there's more of them doing combat and enemies health bars displayed above them yep simple oh we can throw the axe i don't know if you can get headshots with it i think so [Music] that heavy attack is a big aoe effect you can actually hit them on the way back as well okay i think you can get headshots because the crosshair changes launching them there's more [Applause] even the beans use this here hit that thing freeze it you froze it in place clever you're damn right boy there's a chest over there where you're going i think he's this one he can no longer use it we can steal all the silver that's fine father look wait for my mark relax do not think of it as an animal it is simply a target clear your mind steady your aim and breathe in [Music] i got it good it's still alive [Music] your knife finish the job boy no finish what you started [Music] i can't [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] good job boys it's a troll best square to commander tray is to shoot arrows hold l2 then press square to target a specific enemies okay number arrows is on the right and they recharge let's go oh keep shooting i guess that bit on his leg might be a weak spot there i just smashed it wow [Music] starting his head that works that's it shoot him in the face good luck let's get some heavy attacks oh he went for three there oh nearly got it wow surely that's gonna kill him i did see a health thing over here get that just in case [Music] you can easily distract him with that oh he's come on here we go [Applause] boy look at me look at me boy boy look at me [Music] we did it you are not ready boy lost control are you serious i found the deer i proved myself how am i not ready we are going home [Music] i haven't been sick in a long time i can do this you are not ready do not speak again and he did just go sicko mode on that troll at the end oh stunning enemies an enemy stun bar is located below their health bar attacking an enemy in quick succession inflicts stun damage causing the bar to fill okay arrows and bare-handed attacks inflict extra stun damage put that away and then you just rip them apart shooting boy it just kicks him in the face brutal for three arrows from atreus nearly completely like completely fills it up what's this still can't get the doors open huh quiet oh that didn't work maybe we have to come back to that hey boys away yikes okay so use my fists oh my god what is that i told you something was different about the forest and i told you not to speak get down here boy but why would a fire troll burn mother's garden and since when are drivers so close to the house and what was that frozen thing that attacked us i do not know now be silent we are almost home something's going down boy inside boy [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] huh [Music] hey [Music] sorry about that you lost control that thing was trying to kill us it's not like you don't get anger in a fight anger can be a weapon if you control it use it you clearly cannot when you i haven't been sick in a long time i'm better now fine come on then you want me to hit i want you to try [Music] ow will you try again why are you doing too slow try again cut it out weak again again your anger you can get lost in it the battle head is difficult and you atreus are clearly not ready the dragon come on out there's no use hiding anymore i know who you are what's going on do you know him more importantly i know what you are boy beneath the floor now but you told me never go down there who is that i do not know what you talking about i do not know get in just tell me what i want to know no need for this to get bloody i thought you'd be bigger definitely the one long way from home aren't you what do you want oh you already know the answer to that whatever it is you seek i do not have it you should move on and here i thought your kind was supposed to be so enlightened so much better than us so much smarter and yet you hide out here in the woods like a coward [Music] you do not want this fight i'm pretty sure i do rude leave my home you are going to have to kill me for that to happen warned you finally you would not listen no no no no [Music] he's might than he looks [Music] how incredibly disappointing come on then you want to go where's my axe there it is i'm giving him a good scene today [Music] all right he's doing special attacks now too far away it looks like he's just sitting there and taking it are you even trying of course i'm trying come out here just go the trees falling everywhere awesome tell me what i want stop real simple why are there two beds it's gone super sad [Applause] that's a hell of a kick struck a nerve did i use the tree so he can really try again you talk too much that reminds me of the matrix maybe whoever it is you got stashed in that house will now the range is building let's go [Applause] who are you afraid of fine [Music] fight that jump is so cool the rage is over oh man tell me business oh [Music] hmm oh surely he's dead i'm going home mate see ya ruin the landscape everything's broken horrible leaving so soon yeah when odin sent me here i just needed answers but you you had to act i want you to know one thing i can't feel any of this this doesn't feel bad hot damn you've seen it with your own eyes you can't hurt me nothing can this fight is pointless it's discovered in blood is pointless you didn't have to be this way yes it is you can't win i feel nothing but you you feel everything yet you you keep trying i'm not my brother and if you've given me what i wanted it wouldn't have ended this way but no are we raging again finish this okay you can't beat me calm down can't dodge that one i feel nothing [Music] oh no no no no no swinging him around like a rock dog let's go [Applause] get off the edge i'd hope that you of everyone i faced would finally make me feel something but you can't [Laughter] [Music] he's not dead there's no way who was he he knew me did he know my past how did they find me after all this time hey what do i do our son is not ready to kill your ashes to the top of the mountain he'll have to be ready [Music] and neither am i i do not know how to do this without you [Music] but we cannot stay here boy there was so much i i thought you're all right i am all right come tell your things we are leaving i thought i wasn't ready you are not we have no choice now prove me wrong yes sir you can do it boy you can do it the mountain it's gonna be a long trip yes but an important one whoa how did this happen there was some guy that went all dragon ball z on me okay who was he i do not know we're nobodies did you kill him i did what had to be done boy i killed him several times i could have died never leave me alone again all right all right sorry boy it's a big jump oh you've had to kill people before haven't you you're used to it we do what we must to survive animals i get their food driver they're supposed to be dead but people they're trying to survive too close your heart to it on our journey we will be attacked by all manner of creature close your heart to their desperation close your heart to their suffering do not allow yourself to pray for them ray will not feel for you i understand well we've got a hell of a journey ahead of us here has this been here all this time now we can freeze that thank you could you hold me up there okay nowhere to go from here except across this bridge i didn't really do anything interrupt with this i think you can lower it from there huh that didn't work more shinies try this again go made it drop the chain boy yes sir that will freeze it now so we can get back that hanging [ __ ] an offering cast mother said odin's disciples fill them with gifts and hang out with their kids there that one looks really old foolish what is worshiping the gods the gods care nothing for them men should not pray to monsters men should not pray to monsters christopher judd just just got such an epic voice so good now what did we get pack silver so that's quite important then it seems i assume i'll be using that for upgrading what are you gonna get across now [Music] i'm gonna go do it again okay i thought i could just jump over there then we can climb up and get across there we go get on my back boy i don't do an impression of christopher judges i'm not worthy of that father will we see others on the road yes friendly no they'll try and rob us possibly yes no one is friendly we've established that boy come on it's quick [Music] look all this time there's been a protection stave around our entire woods but the staves broke in there did you cut those down she had marked the tree she wish used for her pyre why'd she do that come no looking back now so did she cause the split then so in the protection how long will it take to get to the mountain i do not know before winter falls i do not know okay okay [Music] wild woods edge they don't see us should i fire wait for my mark oh that one is so good oh that one is on fire does that mean that i can't punch him until i freeze him that's a nice combo though if you do heavy you can then do light light light [Applause] are you throwing missiles on me what focus purple as a projectile okay quick turn i assume that will be quite useful you can block [Music] you're annoying keep the pressure on that is really useful having a trailer spinner to put a really quickly hit him distract them whoever is not my focus should be yours but only when safe to do so i can do that look there look here sir there's a yetna settlement ahead yet no you can read the writing some just the language is mother now but they're all sort of connected so sometimes i can feel my way through stuff i shouldn't know you know so kratos can't read the boy is educated oh space your shots speed costs accuracy a light runic attack an extremely quick burst of energy that interrupts and knocks back all nearby energies energy's enemies right move left down to select the lyric attacks hell's touch so they've got different attributes and cooldowns use xp to upgrade runic attacks okay cool oh man this i didn't even realize this game had that kind of thing hold l1 then press r1 to perform a light ring oh sweet move thanks there's the mountain let's go not yet it's fine see hang stay calm almost there oh dear that wasn't so bad slow down your haste will cost us uh sorry are they all dead ugh more dragger but these aren't moving are they dead i mean more dead boy knock dead that's what i wanted to try i do have my spot on rage [Music] that one didn't last very long it was a lot longer in that fight that we had you can't get attacked when you're doing that so i've got that off call now it's a big aoe [Music] [Applause] come back i should kill him it's interesting how melee combat just increases that bar more than the axe does i assume that you can level up your apps and you can level up melee and do them separately that was the last one take even more time it does not matter if you fire only once show me control well these ones stay dead that was a nice little practice arena there enjoy that look at this i was just over there boy i don't know if i want to drop down there there's a chest over there read it oh this used to be a marketplace the giants used to gather here to trade with the gods a long time ago wonder photos over here something's breaking through the wall what that's a big land tell me i think we should do one at a time i actually grabbed on to the boy there don't get overwhelmed it's really useful i don't know if i could do more damage to these with melee maybe not sure [Music] finishing boy good job oh what about you oh you're not tired boy i've got something to tell you oh my god you just don't know it yet what the hell is that what is it we will see stay close i don't like that do we have to why is it so we're going towards the scary singing hey [Music] [Applause] what are you almost invisible almost ready [Applause] wow [Music] ready that's your exo wow so i've got some skills now i think oh it's informing me that i do range combat shield combat magic combo that's obviously the one that i already have requires axe upgrade to close combat and purchase some of that what about the boy can i create the boy atreus will help kratos when enemies are in certain run rubble states for more combo move stun damage i like the idea of that [Music] that's my armor i don't think i've picked any other armor up yet though okay i need more xp so we just upgraded the trace there a little bit all right we were going this way won't we i still don't understand why that man attacked you at our house i told you boy i know nothing more of it he was a nasty man that's all we need to know look up there i guess we need to get back up there but how follow me follow me there's a big chest over there check that out what is that i don't know what that did but okay it's sealed by rune magic we just have to hit those let's go over to the end the r's over there one more where's the sea earlier you said people might try and rob us i'll kill them if they try i'm not afraid if we encounter man you will stay out of it understand but i can fight you will stay out of it boy speak no more of this boy don't get overconfident yeah i don't know where the sea is unless it's up there somewhere i thought it might be down here like hiding away but it's quite a big chest that isn't it so i'd like to find out what's in that there's the sea that's too far away this could like loop it nailed it chains on both sides maybe [Music] i want apples oh that increases my maximum health okay food of the gods and they're just lying around casually in chess i did it come boy everything's gone out of the window now kratos is just like you know what break open all the chests the ice you actually can't so i assume those orange things are just to blow up oh great boy i assume at some point you'll be able to extend how long that lasts what the hell why did it do that [Applause] that's a new one [Applause] i need to get rid of this revenant here i think that's it use his arrows poison is awful horrible all right he's dead focus on her now and some rangelands here that purple one is really useful dammit there we go she's incredibly annoying to fight against sure there's going to be way worse enemies though i need to use that quick tone as well get used to that just hit the wall mate sorry he did okay wow oh we must stay vigilant we made it out alive fine that's a nice simple bridge oh hang on yeah i saw you i'm not falling for that oh maybe i am trixie game designers with their trixie little tricks foxy all these dead you think it's safe in there you think it's safer out here the orange things fill your rage meter there you go luke thank you oh what's that smell [Music] they're untouched look someone start the fires sigmund you're knives so many days without meat wait us these guys are human being what if they change like the others no to keep them alive strip off their meat this fight is mine alone you don't want this fight [Music] simple humor shadow warrior oh okay i'm gonna get him just come around a bit [Music] killing humans is too easy oh was he injured no he's okay i said close your heart to it come then we have a long ninja got to kill him twice yep will handle this all i see boys give me some rage let's go yes it's all good they came back they came back it is finished i want to leave here then collect yourself we must find a way out come boy i boost you up here no here find something to pull me up okay kid get up there [Music] [Music] go you're gonna drop me a rope atreus the jane the chain right you are in your head boy let it go he would have killed you i know i had to do it i do know that legend and we will go home boy what to give up this easily so close to the start wait no i'm not giving up i can do this i just have to you know catch my breath come on up i'm ready we ain't going home boy oh no we're going to the top of that mountain listen to me to be effective in combat a warrior must not feel for his enemy the road ahead is long and unforgiving no place for a boy you must be a warrior brock it sounds like animal noises what you waiting for come on already let's go oh there's a guy here can't get this slow-eyed [ __ ] hump to cross the bridge it's because she's scared of something in the trees over there there's what now father throw your axe at those trees on the other side of the bridge the ones with the white trunks what is it [Music] you were right you must be smart or something boy you're a boy aren't you it sounds like chewbacca does you have a name no no no rude bastardy never asked mine swain ever asked what's yours [Music] say uh you're not gonna believe me but that axe you got it was me what made her me and my brother was one of our best so don't let nobody else go work on her except for us too you gotta handle her special or she'll wreck beyond fixing i can enhance her for you right now if it so pleases you son of a [ __ ] so what see you god you are right i do not believe you come boy there's a rune in the shape of a fork under the grip that was our brand my brother and me before we split i got half of it right here see look you want to sit up crater or not very well i expect an improvement how do you upgrade an axe sharpen it put magic in it why does he walk like that where's the other half of the brand oh my dumb brother's got it but i got all the talent look so what'd you find out there the dwarven shop from here you can upgrade equipment you already own or craft entirely new equipment rock has given you a frozen flame a rare resource resources found in the world can be used to craft and upgrade your equipment upgrade weapon okay so your equipment's got power levels and stats okay got it that's a big upgrade upgrading your weapons unlocks new skills we can make some armor yo look at this what is that that's got strength and defense go for this there's quality material rager going might last a day cool that's changed the way that he looks something for the boy i don't have enough resources so that's what you do with the hack silver okay uh can i upgrade his bow not enough well don't look now but our friends who were hiding in the trees are back for more go on give that action twirl so when that happens i think you have to dodge it i'm gonna get the help over there [Music] [Applause] god they go down really easily see what my touch strong adequate adequate [ __ ] [Music] i'm not sure this road it leads to the mountain should put you in the right direction sure want to see my wares again i'm good for now mate brock he's called i'm sure i'll see you again brock come on it was nice meeting you brock i'll be thinking of a name for your beast how about i name her [ __ ] gratitude hey [ __ ] gratitude come over here uh you left me to fight alone i did was scared everything else you fight until i say stop or we are dead understand how pull your way to we go home i understand good then this way i don't like that you just walk into it it hurts you you have to do that from a bit further back to get some momentum behind it what's through here is a little uh that looks inviting gonna say can't you just push it further around again and that's nice and easy that one so we've got a swirly is that enough i don't think that's enough it's coming back down again yeah so we're going to time it right [Applause] no that's not right would you let it go further than that wait there [Music] whoops boy i got this oh okay i'm on a timer here of course yeah because i pulled the axe out i see i didn't realize first death right there and it was to a giant crusher here we go wait there try that again at least there's spawn now can i crush that yes yes okay cool get on the spikes can you take him out of chase i am gonna check this out here oh no you can't you know what let's just get closer to him then that works [Music] cool this is a big [Music] huh i nearly got any rage there and he's gone get in the chest so if i pull that out that is going to start coming down something up there as well so the axe is just a bit closer to me now so what i have to do is pull it out and hit that a few times i think now boy cool hey that could be valuable i want to jump across here trust i will not let us die one there one here i didn't i didn't even see the chest i didn't find it that just drops down there it is oh no that's that's the chest so where is the r this way i don't know where the r is oh is that it there there it is cool and there are apples in this i think that increase your max health is that right this is something different of blood made right so those chests are increased rage okay cool wow never been this close to the mountain before looks so big [Music] i wish mama's here to see it [Music] [Music] oh boy [Music] he has a strange relationship with the boy oh good fun hey look at that what is it boy look their runes written along the side what does it say as we are we too we three as i alone can never be a riddle hmm maybe there's a clue around here a riddle can i do something with this seems like maybe those rings should be turning let's try and make him tomboy so we have to freeze it and make the correct picture right i think that part's right is that it that's it i see runes boy what do those runes say oh it says family that's not a clue it's the answer what i alone can never be right use your knife and trace the rooms into the sand really kinsley [Music] something happened it works into the cage but i'm happy we're leaving this place it is behind us now it crows checking one wasn't anything up there i thought with that being an arrow there might be boy these tracks hmm a boar maybe not sure but i'll find it go it is important for a warrior to keep his skills sharp holy crap [Music] that's a big troll prepare yourself is that bigger than the first one it certainly looks bigger get some damage this guy's called brenner dowdy that's a great name fire what that's not [Music] [Music] oh it doesn't like that so unless it's like roaring like that i don't think i don't like this these guys are quite weak damn it okay here we go ow him oh yes that's a lot of blood just crushed his head with a flaming log that's fine heavy runic attack cool l1 and r2 so i've just equipped that haven't i yeah cool but he doesn't have any room job shoulder guard you just think we did get some skills too precision throw combo after landing a position axe throw press triangle during the flash to recall the axe and cause the next throw or melee attack to explode on contact damn freezing burst i feel like close combat is gonna be a better option don't have enough xp though to upgrade any of that yet teamwork [Music] cool did i have some more xp there that i could have used i don't think so i can max it out at the moment yeah we need a bit more rage is ready what are you looking at dress complains zelda boy are you your animal ahead i knew shoot when you're ready remember draw it to your chest height is thick but i hid it didn't i i do you and it looked like it bounced off could the board be magical what do you think it looked weirder than any board i've ever seen get after it then could have gone for the belly stay alright more of those people something else what is that some of the bodies are those weird dead things the eyes of odin there are 51 of those to get wow they're very they're stronger dead too they must have been fighting oh there's something back there i love how one swing of the axe just destroys the entire shack i suppose he does have god strength yeah it's kind of opie that's what i wanted to test not too hard so those runic abilities seem to be really strong look it squeezed under that pillar shoot the belly i got it elbow up steady hand relax in the belly accuracy over speed yes do not lose it don't scream yes either i mean that's it's gonna give us away dropped his knife he's too happy-go-lucky boy where are you furry father dear end i wait for me boy it's like the lost woods in zelda right or left that's someone new we don't know we belong to anyone he doesn't he's my friend oh boy was following my command then help fix this hold here please hold i said he's losing blood the last of his kind and all the realm and you shoot him you needed food target practice target practice i'm i'm so so sorry keep that pressure on the blame is mine i should have kept a closer eye will he die i will not let him you the arrow cut a tight way inside him find both ends and hold them tightly start with the left side grab it and hold do surgery on a ball now the right side hold it tight good now pull them together line them up [Music] you're a witch i can't finish the healing here my home is just beyond the trees there you will carry him he must not die [Music] good he seems stable and calm for now this way this is an unwanted distraction look at the size of it oh it's so colorful isn't it my mother made it to me should i go into it i've never seen you in these woods she must miss you being away from home she she's dead or taking her ashes to the highest peak in the realms ashes it was our last wish boy i'm sorry for your loss tmi gonna give the game away boy we're here you live in a tree not in it below it himalay look is he friendly boy i promise you he's safe he's got ghibli bits oh that looks so good you won't hurt anyone don't eat the ball don't eat me okay we're cool giant tall toys whatever you are quickly [Music] place him on the stave there keep him still you live alone it's better this way yeah my father doesn't like people either boy well you don't hold him still before he hurts himself good easy rest now i don't think it's yoshi fresh red root grows just doesn't look like yoshi she's very inquisitive what else i i know you're a god not of this realm but there's no mistaking it he doesn't know does he about your true nature or his own that is none of your concern the gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders trust me i know when they find you and they will they'll make things difficult they already did the boy will want answers that will be my problem whatever you're hiding you cannot protect him forever but you're right doesn't concern me i also need lamb's crafts do you mind it's a white petal flower in my garden just a handful fine lambs chris he does not sound happy about that we're picking flowers now some fish down here check this out it's gorgeous all right find the white flower it's so red lamb's crafts good have you the red root as well the boy is searching perhaps he could use help please the sav is nothing without both ingredients [Laughter] look get everything for you the white one now you want some red one boy can you help i can't quite yank it out of the ground boy would this help dropped it didn't you dropped it i dropped it yeah when you were chasing the animal what's wrong with me foolish if i if i lost it then you did lose it i'll take better care of it from now on disapproval grunting i she doesn't look like a witch i'll go through that way oh exactly what i need so he's gonna live yes then we are leaving wait not without thanks you want solitude this mark will hide you from those who might make your journey difficult just trying to help so he must be a god as well himalayan he just doesn't know it because kratos hasn't told him there's a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods follow this path down then head towards daylight we see you again as much or as little as you like now get out of here oh boy oh and she seems genuine this underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain just use the boat wait and take this you can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world it will always steer you towards your goals okay just give me a compass i see a boat what is that i didn't mean to do that oh these pool guys i want you to tell me about them didn't think they were actually real nightmares yeah they give people nightmares oh for they are nightmares huh i don't remember which i wish i could ask the boats down there that's a big chest press l one and circle to activate okay i don't remember all these button combinations now we'll get to the mountain quick i just can't believe i'm here and always there was a time i thought i'd never leave our woods or even my own beds you are not to blame for your sickness oh i know i guess i'm just saying this is great i don't know what his sickness is they've not addressed it yet there's the mountain how close we are we flow into seawater how do you know do you not smell it that smells deceit she stinks look at that it's thor the war god of thunder oh that's old that's right i never thought you'd listen when mother spoke of the gods i seldom did did she speak of one who could feel no pain oh that sounds like wilder an ace your god the son of odin and free and odin is king that's right why do you ask so the guy that turned up at the start was bolder like as in boulder's gate i see rooms there let's just he might make it out read it boy it reads sacrifice your arms to the center of the water awaken again the cradle of the world what throw our weapons into the water guess that won't be a problem for you are you gonna do it [Music] ah it's not coming back it's a giant snake what is this [Music] oh my god what hey [Music] oh thanks stay calm boy what does it say i don't know that was amazing wait there's a shipwreck way over there see that and there's a statue of thor except i can see a lot more of him now the water dropped when the serpent rose oh that must be why the beach wasn't there before see there's the mountain look it that building leaves from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple it was all just under the surface except for the statue good thing huh there's even a dock there next to the flag [Music] we're going to the dock first right we'll be the first people to walk on and who knows how long you know that second he's one of the guys he's so big he's wrapped around the whole world and bites his own tail an exaggeration i don't know look pretty big to me i hit that how long do you think this has been here a very long time look at that frog is this the way to the mountain it would seem if it isn't the bearded beaver it is sexy if i got something for you too bro but how did you none of your [ __ ] business now get in here i got something for you what and don't go making pig eyes at my spot i saw him first how did he get there he shouldn't have been underwater what do you think he wants to test our patience when word gets out about my new shop folks will finally come out of hiding they'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wares you watch i don't want a whiff of your waist around like that everywhere yes we're gonna upgrade the axe again catch the pile of rocks there with that key of iggy still you can open a magic door to the branches of the world tree a shortcut between the realms if you ever see a mountain in the world use it to get back to be quake fast trouble there's only one way straight back here and nowhere else and whatever you do never never ever never ever throw yourself over the edge of the path unless you want death yeah i don't see us wanting that let's get you squared away man talismans pommels and enhancements are now available at shops talismans have unique effects that canadian combat they can be upgraded at the shop to improve their effectiveness and reduce cooldowns for certain abilities right upgrade my chest armor upgrade the bow i feel like that's a good idea i don't know if you're going to get like different those enhancements i mean that's always going to be good isn't it i just get all of these yeah bonus to look so what does this look start do max pommel weapon pommels can be equipped on your weapon so i'm gonna need some more hacksaw but to do that so the upgrades and equipment are quite they're a big part of this game aren't they really best of luck with all the rampage quite in depth thank you all right so that's a fast travel gate it's blue so i've gotta look out for those look increases proc chances okay go away birds seagulls of doom what is this what is this dude stop copying me here's the end can we blow into it without knowing the outcome well we usually push every button pull every lever we see outcomes we can predict no this is something else we must develop your instincts i knew it we are blowing the horn no we are testing your resolve i have resolved a bunch of it so we're not doing that yet equip your bought talismans on your armor for bonuses so do i have to go back to the dwarf to do that go back to brock don't have a room for his bow yeah right behind advanced combat for atreus atreus has gained confidence in combat and will now support kratos by physically attacking enemies when he sees an opening these abilities can be upgraded in the skills tab okay let's go [Music] oh he explodes i don't know about that oh he went off the edge with luck that tower leads through to the mountain i'm ready you have to have armor with sockets for runes i see so i can't use those anyway then it's a fancy looking door [Music] what love that he's getting involved nice i can't yet so that's on cooldown i still can't read these why not i still can't read these what is that it smells awful poison so that stops the poison i just want to check if there's anything over here here boy look it's the world serpent he's so much bigger than i imagined oh yes yes he bit thor or will bite him looks like i mean that's world serpents up to no good there let me tell you i don't know what these blue crystals are i think maybe i have to come back to this at some point because it just bounces off i'm not sure about those unless i can hit that one there no i think that'll work boy don't tell me what to do so that gets rid of the poison do you think he sneezed boy it's like i don't know a worm slayer it looks like a a female lion crossed with a lizard i suppose that's how you would explain it oh what were those things they smelled awful your mother called them scornfuls poison magic she was the one who showed me how to disable them what it's just funny to think of her teaching you something why is that funny yes am i a joke to you boy boy yeah those blue crystals i think i can probably come back to those one looks different hey it's a fragment of a language cycle we should look for more like this does that mean he can read that stuff now realm of fire i don't think i can do anything with that at the moment let's go boy i'm impressed that they have this running at 60fps considering how good it looks i've just played through uncharted 4 and that was 30fps but i think this looks as good and it's running at 60. i am in performance mode though you can play this in 4k and it down samples it but i would prefer to play in higher fps sure is foggy here another door you should no he is of no consequence uh huh excuse me but um how did you come by that uh axe is my concern alone and uh while i won't dispute that i i know that blade it was one of ours but uh we didn't make it for you step aside i can't see the woman we made it for i was uh well i am quite fond of her and i would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her it was my mother's left its father before she died face dead i'm very very sorry to hear that she was a fierce warrior and a good woman [Music] okay i will make improvements to the axe but nobody asked you to well it's true but but knowing your mother she would have insisted i repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my brother i knew it you are brock's brother the other half of the brands here the blue one is your brother yes though my talents are vastly superior no boast i swear to freya do not undo his work improve upon it only yeah but can you can you put it down over there that handle is no filthy okay then i'll just i will just oh oh oh he's very strange has that dried blood oh so what were you working on oh that i call it the sky mover just up that mountain awaits a treasure trove of rare resources once i mine it i'll need a way to bring it all down and you know how to fix it not even a little oh what brings you around friends resurrection stones they can revive kratos from death what a magical stone that revives craters from death with a small amount of health okay well that's going to be very useful isn't it why would you not want those i presume that you can only have a limited amount of them though is it one at a time and for you is it worth upgrading stuff this early in the game i don't know i feel like when you start playing a game until we meet again you should get some higher level armor before you start upgrading it that's usually how it goes right that's a cool helmet and jump up there only one at a time not you again oh [Music] hmm [Applause] oh come on that was good thank you must get an efficiency boy very good i'm impressed i can't tell are we getting closer to the mountain we are no not you again come face me one-on-one i don't care i'm ready [Music] two of them it's quite easy to dodge that come out of there i can't go in there [Music] [Music] oh that was annoying do you think for this last leg up the mountain that maybe i can carry her i told you no why she meant more to me than you anyway what i just dude you can't say that with you you are all fronting it would serve you to stop talking morning mode i assume that if i throw my axe that is going to explode so i'll keep that in mind for future endeavors what's this then here there's a chesticle here blow these rocks up would you look at that [Music] common chest armor can you i don't suppose you can dismantle the stuff that you don't want or you could sell it i guess at one of the dwarfs yeah i'm about anything else for a trace at the moment what about skills oh that one looks sick i love that boom hold r2 light runic attack a dash attack with a follow-up strike old l1 and r1 all right we'll try that one out [Applause] ah gorilla [Music] oh that looks painful [Music] father [Music] [Music] yourself looks like we're gonna have to fight uh stay awake face is actually on the back that's cool do you want some how do i take you down hmm i've got the rage i could use that if i use this explosive thing here yeah you know like that dude oh no he's on fire now all right we'll go rage get off the edge can i not do right i can steer it ride the ogre oh my god [Music] is that necessary that was cool i enjoyed that who built this place a ball a rare enhancement hmm let's go it's like a rancor rodeo you're right is there a dragon the mountain's base i can see why mom wanted us to bring her here indeed still a long way to go oh there's a face in the mountain that is sick is that smoke i'm exhausted stay back boy what is that we must find another way up rock magic wish she was here bet she could get us past this my magic is useless against the black breath and there's no way the whole time odin saw to that long ago what are you doing here making sure you can finish your journey why would you warn us i was busy saving my friend if you remember the black breath is a corruption of magic even i can't dispel only the pure light of alfheim is strong enough to break through but that road is long what does this goal mean to you it's everything follow me why help us maybe i see more of myself in you than i'm willing to admit maybe maybe by helping you i'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes or maybe i just like you even though we shot your friend even though you shot my friend yes where must we go to a realm beyond your own we're going to another realm are you coming with us only for a little while only for a little while our facial animation is brilliant it must have mocapped that or filmed a real actress and use it as reference take the data we'll use this gray thaw can't send you said it was broken syndry the dwarf at the foot of these hills he was fixing it when we got here no one was there when i passed by perhaps he finished dwarves are awfully resourceful and irritating based on the two we have met that too just give that a turn temple is at the center of the lake it is from there we travel to alpheim thankfully it's no longer underwater why is that creature in the bay no one knows he just appeared one day soon after thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms ultimately it ended in a stalemate and thor returned to odin empty-handed the serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of midgard see told you they've hated each other ever since destined to kill each other come ragnarok you believe in ragnarok i dearly wish i didn't child so thor had a battle with the serpent we actually talked to the world serpent you did an exaggeration i'm good with languages even ones i've never heard before but when he talks i can't understand any of it sadly no one can he speaks a dead tongue oh must be lonely i presume that the serpent won seeing as it's still here watch your step just along here are you sure we came through here before and there's no way that's thought see is that so let me show you something are you watching oh that's what they are what it's solid it's a bridge elven my bowstring was soaked in the light of alfheim it can now reawaken the magic of the elves wait it won't just disappear will it not as long as the light shines free this way i want one those roots what kind of magic is that it's van er from vanahan you know of it just stories mother didn't say much about the barrier gods just that they're always at war with the atu as compared to odin thor they're the good guys there are no good gods boy i thought i taught you that oh we're back here in norse mythology both thor and the serpent die that's interesting ryan here's temple built with help from the giants great tear used it to travel the various realms and keep the peace between them doesn't seem very peaceful hey everywhere we go we're attacked especially by dead things the risen dead grow ever more numerous once the roads and trails would have been full of people now all have hid or fled save for the reavers savage enough to survive in such a world it's kind of cute i like him make a ride at the bottom of these stairs goodbye witch hey another one of those light crystals ah wait there while i reawaken the light leosta that did it what are we doing exactly mending the disrepair start by lifting that axle good now push it back into place now realign the wheel onto the track he's very strong perfect now push the bridge along the track what the whole entire bridge is turning how is the whole entire bridge turning boy you're really strong just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position tired yet no he's always been really strong she knows why i'm strong because i am a god so about the dead you heard someone call them hell walkers but what are they they are poor restless souls denied their judgment and their peace why what could then your magic raise the dead it could once but this is no spell this plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance something or someone has meddled with powerful forces that is all i know for sure that's perfect come back up we're ready now you're realigning the bridge i wonder if the that was impressive you didn't hurt your back did you i did not hurt my back what's that thing in thought all the races helped with its construction it was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before peace disappeared for good is the bifrost in this i assume that's a real thing of norse mythology and marvel just took it from that they didn't just make up the bypass your bow string stop glowing its power is now depleted only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them give it to the boy your bow please once you claim the light of all time infuse the bowstring with its power don't forget upgrade complete thank you lady i appreciate that you talk like you're not coming with us i'll try but measures were taken to keep me trapped in midgard why the gods don't care for me much is this it it's so dark this temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters it needs only the light of the by frost the realm travel room oh this is cool those roots don't look like your magic they aren't these roots are part of the great world tree and make travel between the realms possible how does she know all this approach the table how does it work you will need this a bifrost to create travel between realms it can capture hold and transfer the light of alphaim place the bifrost there what now give it a moment the temple needs time it is from this room and this room alone that you will be able to cross between realms what you see before you represents the temple in which we stand as well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside all the realms exist in the same physical space reflections of each other these doors the towers outside and the nine realms are all intertwined so connected well existing on the branches of the world tree separated only by the bifrost light of alpheim this place can focus and control that light and is this the world tree only an artistic representation of it no the yggdrasil is much much more than this the tree of life is bound to the fate of the world just as we are bound to it the tree nourishes our soils the dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers the trees very existence supports all of creation along its vows it's life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life birth growth death and rebirth well the music is every strand so that's how it works but i'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer yes very well the bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of anaheim instead turn the wheel to our actual destination alpheim wait is this moving the big bridge outside yes the wheel turns the bridge and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside wait there's no tower on this one and that's why realm travel to ottenheim is impossible without a tower for the bridge to lock into the sequence can't begin every realm has a travel room that unlocks the bridge to that realm i'm giving you the one for alpine now you can lock in your destination let's travel there we're ready remember to take the bifrost you don't want to lose that now the realm travel bridge will align and the realm between realms will open whoa one look at these leaves see that giant crystal each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the bifrost opening the bridge to that realm that's why realm travel is only possible from this room what about that one roundtable the yottenheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago when the giants vanished from midgard where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery oh so cool the trees going across we're still here follow me but my frost is dark this trip was its last use there's no going back until it's replenished with the light of alfheim so we are trapped someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to midgard and we'll be able to make that black breath go away with the captured light of alfheim yes so we've gotta go to alpine get rid of the blackness is he here no he's not here you go brock welcome to alfheim gentlemen think you can spot the light i can barely see it something's wrong see that column of light on the horizon it's housed in the heart of a ring temple we'll find what we need there no no no no no damn it not yet what's happening to restore the bifrost magic you must step into the light but be very careful she's not dead she not likely come look at this place stay by me touch nothing okay what is that what if i'd have left my axe in the other realm press triangle would it come back i don't know what it is i think you killed it kratos is good at killing things that's what he does what is that a fairy not our concern boy focus i mean i am quite concerned to be honest and there's dead people with spears through them what the hell they look very strange boy over here what does it say hmm something about an eternal war for the life i don't get it if both sides need it why not just share it greed you will find it a common cause for war he's some kind of fairy keep murdering the lighthouse it is war the end of one the rope oh is this not a reap okay i thought that was like uh [Music] they sound like ewoks this is cool oh my god [Music] yeah i need to try that new attack that i got you didn't do anything more will come where's this stuff even come from cool can i use their weapons did you say something no in real life i did okay at least we're getting closer to the light are you hearing things what is that what's that it's a squirrel wait is this injury when the compass turns gold an objective is somewhere in the area search for clues well these little frogs all right there how do they just get everywhere yes yes come in items i left behind cool so i've got a socket there don't i looks amazing oh thank you so how would i put something in that socket where do i do that look at that there are i need 8 000 for that dude that looks that's the one that just looks cool wrist armor i think that's a keyboard thank you oh we can't forget you hmm what did we miss i've already got a resurrection so nothing oh i could use a distraction master atreus how may i serve upgrade the axe with the frozen flame yeah i need more resources again no no i'll say i've just realized that these are color coded aren't they so the green is just the basic stuff blue is the next level of it level three oh [Music] his steel longer he's warping the bit work got it he's warping the bit work hmm okay i don't want to sell that okay cool happy to provide right now i do have yeah some enhancements here there we go enhancement that increases strength and ruin it by three yeah that seems like a good one to have and there you can see the little room there next to it that's cool we just unlock some more skills there for range combat so i can't do anything more with the bow at the moment got all those shield combat keep working on the axe that seems kind of cool a heavy attack finisher at the end of a light attack so three times r1 one time r2 [Music] cool sweet look there's a boat tangled up over there go so how do we get that then do i have to hit them all at once like in a row like this yeah cool what'd you say i said nothing he keeps hearing things really okay did your mother speak of this realm not much just that since the elves are always fighting over the life they kept them isolated we steal some of that [Music] a drink from the jew the world tree brings lasting benefits cool down permanently increased by two that's an overall style that's applied to your character huh again i said nothing wait this one you said something ah what is it boy voices you don't hear that are you nothing [Music] it's going away now it was screaming lots of voices angry you really didn't hear that no it felt evil i am concerned for the boy [Music] he's got demons inside his head look out there complete an exorcism get him out look should we try talking to them no but maybe they need help they do not stop us so they do not concern us they do not concern us i don't think he's called atreus atreus once yeah doesn't use his name oh wow that must be the ring temple it's sad the elves can't work things out i'll find such a beautiful place but the blue door that's gotta be the entrance let's go i'm not going to be that simple boy what are they doing [Music] uh the bridge is on to cover the crystal with that stuff why to prevent reinforcements they do they sound like ewoks here we go right so we got it four hang on [Music] oh that's what i wanted oh my god that's brutal i love that ready done can't drop down there maybe we can fix the bridge from down there feeling like we can drop down can we climb up here no [Music] the hell was that over here okay so that did something yeah there's another one on the right oh beautiful we do not belong here boy they do not like us wait combined together like that they kind of look like a room it doesn't make sense come back to the boat one thing you have to appreciate in this game is the scale they've done it very well there's a lot of games that just get scale wrong but everything here feels big and it doesn't it's not faking it it it feels like it really belongs it's sad the elves can't work things out i'll find such a beautiful place but war makes it ugly you see with the eyes of a child in war the soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy enough stories are for the father the pillars of dog what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life's most pure hot yep it's water it was the voices again but different voices less angry you're asking for help we are here for the light i do not care who they are nor what they want you never care about anything you have something to say [Music] now what's happening whoa look what we found i'm not sure what to make of it being completely honest the voices i heard it was hard to make out but way in the back i'm pretty sure i heard mother that is not possible i know what i heard petraeus enough he's got special armor oh [Music] that's right get him boy get up oh come here oh you can't get near him it's fine [Music] again [Music] away from those cages i wonder why they're locked up they have christmas be ready what the other guys from the start hope that was worth it turn it again hmm can we get an angle on that i wonder from in here there's something out there hmm beautiful a propulsive slice attack that launches a small vertical wave that inflicts medium frost damage don't mind if i do come on address [Music] [Music] [Music] you ready boy good job but i'm saving my rage because i feel like there's a boss or something coming up i think that side hallway will get us to the temple we will find out i gotta stick that it's a long way down there there's a room thing up there as well so i'll be on the lookout for those you were wrong back there oh i know mother's boy's better than anyone she is gone boy speak no more of this fine okay it's just the way back nothing in there hey hey um that's a hell of a throw oh oh all right can we go across i would like to see no let me across how do i get across oh i've not been able to do that before let's casually break through rocks did happen right at the start again to be fair is this necessary yeah this is the boss i think okay let's use my spot ranger i love that attack that's so cool when he charges it up you can just feel the power in it damn it [Music] brutal man so good thanks hey you sure the witch is okay i'd hate to think she died helping us she knew what she was doing okay she's fine the witch is absolutely fine andreas don't worry your little cotton socks about it that's locked what does that mean i can't jump down there maybe i'll get a tool that will allow me to unlock that later on more of it i did get some skills as well i think got enough points here in spartan rage hold r1 to deliver a forceful haymaker that knocks enemies backwards hold r1 for an axe attack that hits enemies multiple times and locks them down yes like that crowd control [Music] cool we need the bow don't we we need the special bow to get that i think perhaps i need to go back up through this way about there later maybe hey boys there's a chest there i don't see where that's connected to no way across here too bad the witch's bow string doesn't work anymore we used up see i'm thinking though when atreus gets that special bow you can recharge it with those things just a guess i don't know that for sure oh it was down there didn't even see that if we cut enough away the bridge above us should reappear right expect resistance right there's always resistance i don't like walking on this it's horrible not a big fan of that at all [Music] oh rage no almost [Music] what is that you're fine this is new wow wow okay i don't know how to defeat this come on do it again i wanted that piece whatever that is damn that does so much damage can we use it against him can we pick it up it's gone now do it again [Music] i just throw it that's cool [Music] so we have to pick up pieces of him that he drops come over here oh they don't okay they don't last very long open up oh they explode after a while that sucks okay so i'll get it do that you knock some pieces off him get the pieces throw him at him [Music] [Music] dude right and this oh that's a lot of damage there oh more mobs it just ruined me there's some health over there try and get it let's look it nearly dead not ready i knew there was some kind of a boss coming up as well do you ever get no you just get the feeling a rare enhancement reduces all damage from dark elves attacks so they're dark elves i didn't even realize well there it is watch our backs boy you're freezing at first we must find a way up let's get to the top make sure we check this chest here [Music] thank you very much a rapidly spinning melee attack that sounds cool right back to the top huh guess the light makes more than bridges you can use it on top you know i will never get used to walking on solid light but it's quite a peculiar the door experience there's no seam what we have a problem these doors do not open hello i don't get it i even have a door then hello come we will find another way in but how more of those bells another chest must be nearby it's the first time i've seen those bells so you've gotta how would you do this you have to do it in the right order i guess crn perhaps [Music] yes no was there not quick enough just gotta be really quick okay try and get as close to the entrance as i can got it cool one more and i can increase my rage yeah you have to be quite quick with that one the dwarf again this way hey sundry could you take a look at this honestly i don't know how much else going on right now how does he get around can he just teleport everywhere i'm not sure anyways guys i think i'm gonna leave it there for part one i hope you enjoyed that it's about three and a half hours i think that's a good place to stop i'm having a lot of fun with this the combat is very satisfying the graphics are incredible the atmosphere the environments i'm really into the story seeing where this goes there's some interesting puzzles and boss fights too but with that said i hope you enjoyed part one we will be back tomorrow for part two if you did like it leave a like and subscribe if you want to see more hope you enjo enjoy the rest of your day and i'll see you next time bye
