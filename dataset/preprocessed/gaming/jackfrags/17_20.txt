okay today we're playing a game called anger foot a lot of you guys have suggested that i try this out the demos just been released and i don't know much about it apart from the it's kind of like a first person hotline miami with room clearing so sounds interesting let's get stuck in give it a go okay we're in a corridor got some hard house playing i can kick and there's some weird crocodile people hello the music ramps up the more action is going on i'm down for that and there's a lot of kicking so far can i steal that pipe somehow no apparently not i have to drink i can drink oh hello i have a beer that mate that was lucky i think they are crocodiles this is yeah definitely interesting and there's some weird cockroaches on the floor all right lads i know there's four in here oh you can rag gollum onto each other cool is that the end of the first level yeah all right i'm digging it level two okay can't say that i got a gun nice all right one hit kill i have a bit of that door mate oh we've gone door number one door number two door number three it's censored door number four nobody in there you got a gun yeah you do so can i right right click throws it so that's how i get ammo back i guess it's like super hot and now i understand why it's called anger foot he's just a guy who's really angry and he's just got a powerful foot oh no can i really run out of ammo in that we good okay level two done i've just realized there's a timer as one in the top left so you're gonna do it as fast as possible i suppose without taking hits and stuff hello nice yes oh no oh that's not that's not a good way to die is it on the toilet oh it's fast paced though i like that you shoot your mate is that an explosive barrel hello i wasted a few shots there oh that's a painful death i'm gonna get this guy's gun hopefully you guys can hear me over the music here i just have to check all the doors can i drink that kind of energy drink oh that's maybe run faster overdrive the beats quicker as well cool oh we're driving a car now what am i some kind of monster with one eye and horrible sharp teeth what the hell oh my god this is weird is that my girlfriend [Music] i like i can rub her face and get some popcorn eat the popcorn i'll throw the [Music] drink some popcorn this is so weird can i use anything else in here the phone oh there's me and my girlfriend in a picture look at that the phone's ringing now hello anger foot the goo cop yes notice anything missing i don't know yeah regret interfering with the crime gang this is so strange but so cool at the same time check your fax machine give you a nice rub there bianca we're getting a fax i don't know why she's called bianca but we're going to go with that show me the facts we have arthur [Music] they've got they've got a pair of my trainers my sneakers is that snake on the phone as well looks like a nokia 3210 oh no arthur's missing can't believe they're taking arthur my favorite pair of sneakers oh you got a gun oh i did some kind of double kick there when i jumped that was cool barrels yeah we got barrels oh there was a lot of barrels in here this way i'd already killed you with the door oh you just shot your mate whoa oh good idea hello yes left or right left what the two crocodiles in the bathroom sure there's a joke there somewhere let me go come on then oh there's so many explosives in there i have to do it just to say flammable why is it not exploding there we go oh this is a cool game i really like this sick next [Music] you don't start with a gun either it's an uzi yes nice little uzi now some submachine gun action here [Music] did i miss it yeah this way oh no ruined in the bathroom that was a dog i love the gooey blood effects they're super cool oh it's a massacre [Applause] go as fast as i can oh it's a bigger room here i need a better gun i need a gun am i nearly dead i feel like i'm nearly dead is that it okay that stage was pretty quick high octane though with that smg what are we up to now number six i think there's ten in the demo uh grenades bang or they do a little cuckoo sound no that's not good there's more grenades there excuse me grenades get back anyone in here nope i mean this is really really uh fun to watch the double grenade excuse me lads no this way they're all throwing grenades at me it's fine that's a grenade please i think the speaker saved me nope your grenadine days are over that's another grenade yep not gonna walk into that i actually got him as well so that's the grenade stage obviously i'm into this man my my heart is bumping i can feel the adrenaline we're in the sewer and we got a shotgun nice oh oh it's purple gurinas did you have a gun you did so the red ones are all melee but if they look a bit different like this guy look at that face they've got the blue on sometimes they can have guns oh hello there not looking so good for you either spaghetti boy who's that is that me the bosses maybe oh wow where did you come from damn is he dancing okay right so if you die it just resets just more purple gooey slaying then give me that i know those guys are hiding there now and then there's one here one here yeah either side may you be there i'm trying to do the jiggle peek you know keep it jiggly is that health no it's a camera is there a gun sure there must be another one yeah big room there's a valve can i kick it i just spawned some enemies oh i need ammo no that's not right give me that give me the pistol thank you well that was a bit messy wasn't it this way could i have just left then without killing them maybe that's for points or something and i'm on the toilet with the phone okay level 8. still in the sewer very good oh grenade guys dodge that on the corridor hello i got some g's give me that i like that yes that smg is so sick oh kick yes there we go double door anyone in the stalls no but i can kick that it's suicide then they just all drop down and kill themselves damn it oh almost died then what the tentacle have a knife oh god they do they have little knives look at that excellent right two more stages is it level nine wasn't this like a boss or something is he has he got a riot shield oh go this way i think that guy actually had a riot shield oh is this the flank here ow yeah he's got a shield don't go in the green stuff it's a grenade that's another grade that's another grenade someone's shooting me then shotgun bro in there anyone in here dead anyone in here dead i don't think the shotgun has the range there does it pistol and one more shot from death i think oh oh i clutched it this way this genre of music oh my god there's so many it's called hard house isn't it or something like that there's more of those weird what are they they just oh these these ones have got guns it's very unusual love the art style i didn't get you did i that's not the shield guy there flank here maybe wait did these guys not have guns oh no i need a gun give me that oh you can just kick him with the right shield cool level 10. we've got a window i jumped through that what do you say you got a gun yeah what is that i'm gonna kick you right so now we've got explosive suicide guys and you can shoot them in the head and blow them up what is going on here they're just having a great time and i've just come in there and ruined them all the sneakers i can't kick that shoot those in the head that's really useful you know good for area clearing smg my favorite god i'd love like uh someone who's really really good at this game to just give it a shot and just it will be so much fun to watch i take out all these guys with that one i know there's one here exploding lad yep that works really effectively oh my god kick that's where you need the explode you got oh my goodness well i'm end of level hey we're on the rooftop i was a helicopter the goo copter no gun or anything please no not like this i can't find any guns just kick it oh yeah apparently that works okay i mean i have kicked everything else in the game so far so why wouldn't that work against the boss here i can't really go on the front of it it just hurts me underneath oh yeah you like that don't you look at that belly give him that little belly oh oh my god it's got boosters hey it's not like this no no no oh my god he nearly got me there please oh did we get it i think we kicked it where are you going we it's gotta be a stage two full health bar again what are you doing you're dropping explodies the bottom turns red and then it drops out the exploding lads that we've just been introduced to i can't really uh go anywhere near that because it'll kill me couple more do the trick get away oh my god we get it stage three okay it's just a car now okay it's a whoa okay it's a car with a mine on the back what is that look at these mad lads whoa okay it's like robot wars it's gonna knock me off [Music] uh okay i think i have to stay on this side of it it's crazy get off oh my god that was close
