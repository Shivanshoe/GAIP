[Music] hello everyone and welcome to cyberpunk 2077 obviously there's a lot of hype for this game and today i wanted to jump in [Music] i haven't really followed the game much apart from the initial previews but we're gonna have some fun this will be part one i am playing the game in 4k we've got everything on ultra everything's turned on i don't know what the frames per second is gonna be like but i'm really looking forward to it we're gonna have a good time i'm excited a little bit apprehensive i saw a few of the previews that's it with that said we're gonna dive in here get it done now this is the most difficult decision of all do we want to be nomad street kid or corporal nomad roaming the bad lines looting scrapyards raiding fuel depots life on the road wasn't easy but growing up in a nomad clan has its perks honesty integrity and a love of freedom qualities that few united city possess and no amount of money and buy street kid they say if you want to understand the streets you got to live them gangs fixes dolls small time pushers you were raised by them all down here the lord of the jungle dick takes the wheat serve the strong the only law in night city you've yet to break corpo you lead the corporate world with their lives you are still with their souls intact you've been there you've bent the rules exploited secrets and weaponized information there's no such thing as a fair game only winners and losers oh man this is a tricky tricky choice i think most people will play as street kid and then nomad so i want to do things a bit differently and i'm going to go corporal for this we'll see how it goes now just a heads up this game is rated r there's nudity violence excessive language so just keep that in mind if you want to watch so we're going to go with mail v for this one we've got all sorts of customization options here that are just ridiculous i could spend all day here messing around with this stuff beard style beard color cyberware facial scars facial tattoos teeth eye makeup i mean this is just ridiculous nipples body tattoos body scores genitals penis size you got the whole shebang the whole shebang but for the purpose of just getting into the gameplay we're gonna stick with the default v preset we've got character skills here seven points available body body determines your raw physical power in addition to allowing you to force open doors intelligence determines your net running proficiency reflexes determine your maneuverability technical ability your technical know-how and cool you've got a cool factor hmm you only start with seven points i feel like we should put a couple into body intelligence tech ability reflexes one more in body and we'll have one call point as well for the sake of it right let's go with that there's my backstory that's my fingerprint i don't know if i should show that to you guys confirm here we go let's do this let's go answer the phone you there yeah yeah i'm here you all right fine just needed

looks a little out of whack babe i can release it for you but you'd have to watch out for negative energy fields and avoid mean reds anything red i can release it for you but you'd have to watch out for negative energy fields and avoid mean reds v yo listen up i talked to dex while you were in with the doc he's waiting in his ride for you ain't gonna hump to where he's parked next to gramsci burgers okay do my best to talk us up i'll meet with dicks [Music] bushido 6 street school listen i've got this delicate matter that's why i called you the number of cyber psycho attacks in the city is on the rise now that's probably not news to you but this issue matters to me for a few reasons there are people who say cyberpsychosis can be treated it slows everything down right and i know exactly how that sounds but i believe even an unproven therapy is still better than a bullet to the brain if i get a tip about a possible attack i'll give you a call maybe you can investigate before max attack hits the scene but remember you're not there to execute anybody try to incapacitate it there was day there are various ways to incapacitate enemies without killing them smash them on the back of their head i have heard their voices let they who yet live never this is night city no one's got a soul to lose mark as you will unbeliever you shall see who laughs last as you're engulfed in hellfire satan himself that's so weird see now i'm so cool for coda i heard the runner who wrote that satan demon gave him a weak sense of humor if again you can just look up and around everywhere no one's asking me when there's crime everywhere isn't there that looks like robert downey jr just steal the police car i could break into it yeah sounds like harley quinn mr j what is going on there i'm just having a battle i don't want to i don't want to shoot the police no no no not about that life yet this is decks thanks to the shawn and the kids would you rather live in pieces mr nobody die right old and smelling slightly of urine or go down for all times in a blaze of glory smelling near like poses without seeing your third it's first place or no place dex cost isn't a factor classic i'd expect nothing less from eager supple youth respect all right listen close scanning a serious job now playing gargantuan compared to smashing up a scav home let me hear it what's the job there's this prototype tech a biochip to be precise jobs to grab it simple yeah guessing it belongs to a court arasaka that's no problem that's a big big big big problem no no problem just a death sentence nc's arasaka's turf nobody [ __ ] with them here what can i say mr b high risk high reward first rule of the afterlife besides that i'm no lead head ain't gonna leave no stress for them to follow because we're gonna do this no affiliation we understand each other you work this out got a plan two things first a conundrum with the maelstrom boys needs active resolving that second to rendezvous simple klein who brought us the job's anxious she wants to parlay with harley what's the issue needs resolving with maelstrom got it beef slot in the shop i've got a classic tail for you psycho gang doing his thing two weeks back jumped a militech convoy got away with the gear corp don't even know maelstrom's involved now see convoy was carrying the flathead a little combat bot a prototype and i need me that bit of high grade military tip because if we don't get that by we don't get no soccer chip and we sure as hell don't get no happily ever after but don't get excited it's a single-use toy now i flat-out purchased the damn thing from maelstrom problem is i did so from a gentleman by the name of brick brick i say win pretty hardcore names leader three days after we'd see the idea his friend and gang mate won simon randle aka royce playing dropped his ass royce is in charge now and i got no way of knowing if he aims to honor his predecessor's word to add to the shitstream one meredith stout of militech has developed an interest in said convoy who's the prima donna corporal agent internal affairs been skidding around town asking after the convoy as if her life depended on finding it the one lead she's got zip tied in her trunk stick up her ass ain't growing any shorter so she must be getting desperate people to think how you could use that of course to do so you'll need that frazzled cat's info sending it now frazzle cat client it's a strange phrase isn't it why she need to meet a woman's name's evelyn parker better wasn't easy put the word out i was looking for any kind of intel right and some brothers from pacifica got back to me told me to stop looking and the convo anyway our little client insisted on meeting someone with skin in the game you know who'll be there for it all yours truly will be remote t-bug ain't no people person and jackie's only good at some things i know you know what i mean pretty much leaves you i'm good i think i got everything time i got to work well that's just music to my ears i'll set up the meet with miss parker at lizzie's bar flat head though is gonna be all you flathead not a great name is it i barely explored the city it was just that one tiny bit when i got out of my apartment and i went down the elevator i think i just could have gone then and just gone wherever i wanted one more thing mr b quiet life or blaze of glory that's the choice is he smoking got a fat cigar see you later street cred build your street cred to make a name for yourself in the night city underworld new opportunities but to me feels more like he tangled us up with maelstrom and militech there's this combat bot military prototype maelstrom clept it then decks paid to take it off their hands just before the gang goons had to switch up in management all right right heard about that royce versus brick hostile takeover that sums it up dex wants us talking to royce give the deets of some militech agent too but i don't know how much help she stands to be then there's the other thing gotta meet the client who put the job on the table evelyn parker you oh what's dick's gonna do right around in his limo jet chicks up on the hollow parker wants to meet someone on the crew dex gave me the nod they must know what he's doing so how you want to play this bell strummer parker was first i say we knock on maelstrom's door first pound actually in that case i'll hit the all foods put my nose to the ground stick around hasta luego i like how it auto translates it it's cool all right so i call my car over [Music] i'm going on the highway oh no [Music] [Music] together ah there you are cool bike look at this squared away the decks already paid the maelstrom is for the corporal bot thing is can't be sure the gang goons are still willing to hand it over he paid up front well whatever let's go get this tech you scheme yet you got a plan buy it off him that [ __ ] can go smoothly this is maelstrom gang world ain't too complicated might's right the strong survive either you [ __ ] others or you get [ __ ] so into the borg beast then let's go let's go see these bastards all right let's knock on their door see if they even open up just walk through the car jackie how'd you do that it had to be them just a gang like any other right machete valentinos they follow god and honor means something you know what they want how they get it and what pisses them the [ __ ] off with maelstrom you just never know go on let them know we're here how do i let them know do i just are you saying gotta get this done where is the intercom oh there she put my gun away for now don't know you want to talk to royce dex sent us main roof we've been waiting um this is a bit suspicious isn't it i don't know about this he plays i could use a few plants though oh yeah they look damn well prepared don't think i've ever seen security like this in the chow factory gear from the jack convoy gotta be must have been all over it like maggots on dead meat you hear about their boss royce dex mention them call them special we just mean us homes anti-personnel mine directional shrapnel spitter my favorite subtle this place is trapped it's trapped up man this is not gonna go well [Music] hey stay cool they're just trying to spook us dude is crazy remember we're on their turf so what do you want you got a bot model mt-0d12 called the flathead and the hell you care guy i represent already paid brick for it i'm just here for the pickup i can talk direct to royce if necessary nah you talk to me i'm dumb now couch plan let my ass

feel it for yourself come on give it a whirl i don't think that's a good idea thanks i'm good whatever you say straight-edged princess wow look at the hardware here we go the flat head model mt-0d12 need to see it suit yourself [ __ ] tricked out this thing dynamic thermo-optic camo armor full cognitive immersion with a raven controller pimped out prototype actuators made of titanium vanadium kevlar composite and watch this fully integrated link too so when the spider starts crawling up walls dangling from ceilings you could lose your lunch so what you think yep we'll take it free sure yeah let's see your cred brick god it's all paid up [Music] [Applause] i don't see any [ __ ] brick around here do you you [ __ ] deaf ask you a question and expect me to pay for this thing twice and who the [ __ ] are you to say what can and can't be you'll pay twice because i say you'll pay twice all right you want the flathead i better see some eddies [Music] a discount you know he never did say who sent you never did say who you're working for dexter deshawn that's it dexter deshawn the hard ass who punching animal [ __ ] half a pacifica oh it's one quickly do the body not a little smg there it's empty i'll get in there [Music] chaos iconic item with a set of crafting specs [Music] copperhead nice ricochet weapons control the direction of the bullet have a look at my inventory [Music] okay that in slot one aod advantage cool look at this bad boy so how do i actually ricochet the bullets i'm not sure got a lot to learn [Music] let's get this set bought and controlled let's get out of here frag grenade combat gadget slot that's a flashbang next item frag grenade there we go aim a grenade by holding middle mouse then release the button through it okay easy well i think we're in for some war here guys i think there's going to be some hot combat going down it's a production line plus i thought you loved me really no other way we just hacked this stuff that's just an average laptop i think the beer how did you get up there oh good let's go [Music] i don't really know i'm here what is that [Music] no [Music] [Music] i know you are jackie what are you doing what the hell was that a ladder that was a weird bug did it just teleport me to the other side of the room [Music] whoa okay that was strange got some pants [Music] please don't teleport me again nice of you to show just trying to get bored and jackie teleport as well i feel like he can [Music] he just peeks around no jackie move let's go jackie please trying to get through jackie move out the way [Music] i'll be your friend can you not see me you can be proper stealthy in this game coming for you oh god i think that's a turret ladies and gentlemen yeah i've been fighting now overheat what overheated i don't know who's ready to pull a grenade there's a lot of recall on the gun surprisingly oh there anyone left in the room one more maybe oh no there's multiple they're so spongy grenade out hang on well it was going really stealthily and then all of a sudden hey that's my new weapon site oh that sounds awesome i really like the sound of that gotta get at the top this way something's going on i don't know what all this overheating stuff is by the shotgun yeah you can charge that up that's cool not much range on it though some ammo back for that it's got a trigger delay on it [Music] i'm not sure i like this gun [Music] good one good one jackie from what there's no one else here everyone's dead i think i could junk all this stuff afterwards [Music] oh god okay now they're dead i don't see very responsive the enemies let's close [Music] no let's not pick up any what more i get here there's a couple of assault rifles i found wasn't there 68 that's more dps that's a cool scope they have some perks as well health regenerates during combat annihilation shotguns deal more damage street that's the melee stuff isn't it not enough points for that there's my katana you know who you're messing with over here [Music] okay the katana is really good why wasn't i just using the katana the whole time one good shot and we're done [Music] over here i'm empty need to reload [Music] let's get out of here i would love to so much stuff to collect though okay what what what what is that an lmg hold on let me just see what this is okay do i get to use this hopefully all right we made it out just about we did it jackie how do i spend those attribute points how do i do that like that so that's just the base level of those stats i think no begging no debt no corporal strings attached and the flathead's ours that's the way to do busby that's it buddy tough to argue yeah cause i'm right always nice of you to notice do i get to ride that bike i got some boots i would like to see the bike the city of endless and brotherly hate but if you got the cojones and you know how to use them you could do damn near anything unless you catch a bull stray or not even then you go out with a bang right and the street will talk the street will remember what now jack what now now i go back find misty do something to make me feel alive again it could have shot us up good back there no two ways about it risks come with the job jack ducked in time to avoid death sweeping sight again only right to celebrate even though we get to do that lots don't forget to let dex know we got his toy for him hello ducky just drove into this got the bot and how to go run into any trouble and what about the militech angle sure of course there was trouble royce couldn't have given two shits that you and brick had shaking on how'd you get him on board you used the corporal woman did without militech holding my hand didn't want to risk it so how'd you get that cat royce to hand over the flat head only way i know that always works brute force you got some balls i used some firepower and murdered everywhere still on the to-do list that meets the only thing that'll get you a chance at grabbing that chip park will be waiting for you at lizzie's bar good luck good luck all right where's the car where's the whip there it is put me in coach let's go [Music] it's cool at nighttime sorry oh did i just kill someone it was an accident sorry what shaken night city your man stan here got a shopping excursion planned in kabuki well let your choombas know your schedule's just opened up the district's recently been hit with a wave of abductions with most pointing the finger at scabs productions surprise my advice stay at home save your enemies save your kidneys some cool looking cars oh i just missed my turn i was too busy looking at the cars [Music] banging tunes in the car that's fine this is lizzie's bar they've got cat people looking a little put out there input yes interest you in a prembd a bd what do you got what don't we got women and men of your dreams synaptic acting a-listers no washed-up virtue porn boy toys or blow-up dolls here oh tour stuff it'll grip your heart and blow your nerves right out of your body pure bit that's why people come here clearly know how to sell it not a sales pitch it's a warning i'll give you one word bespoke not for everyone's synapses think you can handle it another time you know what i don't get demonetized on youtube thanks dad i would like to come in reconsidered huh not my first time don't remember you because i didn't get in through the front huh get a load literally just seen me right rules are simple someone catches your eye you do not grapple you find him in the catalog ask for a bd and get yourself a box no recording no cop and feels when the guards ain't looking and you go have fun i think we're going to get demonetized anyway boys there hey get you something i'm looking for evelyn parker you know she's here who's asking name's v she and i have a date well v it's a pleasure a mateo uh-huh so evelyn club's big we're gonna have to look around can't do it for you it's all right mateo is that evelyn what's up [Music] you want your drink evelyn parker i knew it was you as soon as you walked in [Music] tequila senson only tequila i drank how do you know i like to know everything about the people i work with either that or it was just a lucky guess mind if we talk about the job heard you got something for me but not here come with me we'll be in the lounge mateo anyone asks if we're not here nothing true really i just told you [Music] dex had a load to say about you called you professional effective and trustworthy i hope he wasn't overselling i'm the best no idea if dex exaggerates a little a lot you got me just started working with him in fact i've heard there are two kinds of fixers those with stable crews on long contracts and short leashes loyalty and predictability they value above all else then there's the other kind dexes kind come on can't leave that hanging headhunters they lay their trust elsewhere not in people but in a thing their intuition they bet on potential and if they lose that bet it's the last mistake they ever make i'm hoping dex's intuition has served him well in this case let's cut to the chase what do you got for me your target i trust you know what it is relic secure your soul trinket key tech in the program actually we're tangling with arisaka making this heist one dangerous risky [ __ ] howdasaka's poured billions into personality transfer technology but me i just want the data on this one the chip is tucked away inside kompecki plaza the hotel you ever been nope classy corp hotels yeah no out of my price range hmm all the decors to die for as you'll see for yourself so where's this chip hiding exactly in a suite on the top floor the rooms occupied by yori nobu anasaka in night city i guess the scream sheets weren't lying this time it's on the lips of everyone in the city sapuro arasaka's only surviving son heir apparent to the arasaka empire in town please could it be emperor is prepared to seed his throne after 150 years doubt it only a handful of people in night city know what the odasaka's real plans are telling me you're one of them look if you've got any spare aces up your sleeve now's the time to show them now this should make your prick perk up yori nobu recently swiped the chip from an arasaka laboratory he's made a deal with netwatch aims to sell it to them have you spotted my ace yet or do i need to spell things out nope don't buy it now watch his integrity rests on their neutrality why would they tarnish their rat by procuring stolen goods [Music] netwatch provides net security for all corporations and collects eddies in the millions for it but in this day and age everyone's in the game and no one can afford to be a saint to win one has to go all in fine so no arasaka's security on the device because yorinobu whisked it away in secret now where's he hiding it likely in a specialized container one that mimics an organic neural environment on the outside it looks like an ordinary briefcase and the case is you'll see for yourself soon enough provided we're done gossiping about we're done okay what's next now comes the best part follow me got something for you should help you plan brain dance from kompecki plaza how's the brain dance supposed to help need facts not thrills i think bds are only good for fondling virtual tits [Music] it can be a very useful tool no analyzing details human perception even boosted doesn't grasp exactly what you need so what's on the tape yorinobu suite the glorious interior wow you'll need to locate the relic yourself hope i grabbed enough detail to make that possible got it hold up mean to say you recorded this bdrk implant why you object no not at all let's see this brain dance uh-huh judy will help show me the money besides we go back uh years uh-huh v this is important judy's always been there for me always helped out i trust her but she's a mox not the latest member of your crew try not to forget so you'll be a good boy dread lightly and keep that tongue on a leash relax believe it or not i'm no stranger to tagged in biz or life 15 off dude i had one of those it wasn't great hey there you are this is v he's here for that bd roll and v this is judy best brain dance editor i know enough already hi judy hey judy compiled your bds what do you think will it do still pretty raw but yeah ought to do v needs to get deep inside that's most important hey so let's calibrate tune into him believe me have dealt with worse should see the jig jig street porn we gotta contend with sometimes so we drop the inside let him look let him rummage around right it's the matrix raw brain dance ever taken a dip before uh no i think i can handle it let's just do this do it right put me in the matrix sit down settle in and we'll get you going you did you did gotta create your sensory profile first okay hit me just promise me it won't hurt it won't not this time now sit still look at me i'm gonna run the analysis soft should feel a slight tingle [Music] okay now let's set the optics and other sensory sticks look smack into these two screens pretend it's an eye exam am i gonna have to do this calibration dance every time not necessarily but it's worth the wait give me two more minutes and you'll see exactly what bd analysis is capable of one more sec need to get the pain receptor limiters in okay all set you need to test your profile first tossing in a sample bp you can use it to get to know the editor now let me see where can we can't he just use my recording why are we wasting time so we don't risk our necks sides won't take a sec got something here shouldn't be perfect boot it up let me give you the tailored version first as you get your bearings and we'll jump into editing be diving in three two one plan simple do nothing odd don't get creative you go in snatch the cash get out and we sell the pd to those psycho freaks from the studio got it got it and remember everything on full blast they'll spot us extra for a wicked adrenaline high this is a recording it's a memory almost i'm not controlling this as of yet we're just watching this everybody autograph when i see you kissing the flooring money now where i will [ __ ] drop you i swear to god whoa yeah now before i blow your [ __ ] head off ah you got a shot slow deep breaths your cortisol and adrenaline spiked but the soft activated your hormone blockers nothing happened you're alive and well that was too much i felt i could feel the guy's pain his stress his hope hope wrapped up in something else probably took a booster just before you'll be fine you can feel everything he was failing as well i mean this is a horrible prospect really if this was real like that'd be so messed up [Music] i'll sever the link to the bd roller sensory array you'll be able to look around freely editing mode full cam control and analysis mode so move around zoom in and out whatever else you come up with because it is your own little sandbox so analysis mode you control playback can even pause when you feel the need then you use the editor console to unpause try it plan simple do nothing odd don't get creative you go in i can play and pause the memory get out and we sell the pd to those psycho breaks from the studio got it got it dream as hell right well that's not all you can speed things up or rewind whatever you like give it a try rewind it back to the top now try fast forwarding a bit this is the batman thing simple do nothing okay you can also reset the recording that'll take you right back to the beginning try it now for some fun this here's why you came in the first place in analysis mode you get to view and even scan details of the enviro recorded by the bd roller focus on the heat the gun this gunk gets from his buddy at the beginning now scan it plan simple do nothing odd and remember everything on full blast they'll spot it extra for a wicked it is right here excellent let's move on now heads up in analysis mode you can ferret out background noise and conversations if the roller got close enough this tech records everything every little detail even the sights and sounds the roller was never aware of to see the sources of the recorded sensory signals switch to the audio layer in the editor go ahead and try that now okay good whoa now this is crazy several sound signatures in the store choose one and hone in on it so it's just a recording isn't it so any thoughts unbelievable seriously like what's happening right next to me yeah it's how bd recording implants work they pick up everything all the elements in the background then an editor tweaks them makes them pop so you could falsify it then explore it a bit we'll move on when you get bored sometimes you can analyze extra layers in the raw stuff the rollers cyberware picked up like what eb's got karoshi optics that grab infrared meaning you should be able to grab heat signatures from her recording hello nice now let's wait till the guy punches out the gunk at the counter everybody scanning works on peeps too walk up to the wounded chick try scanning her all right next thing scroll forward to the part where our artist gets a nut injection so he gives him the money and he walks back outside and he gets shot they shot him and he never saw it coming but you will here it comes my favorite part of the game see the blinking thing over the entrance surveillance cam must have caught our shooter you'll see in a sec cam feeds to the screen behind the clerk roll back to where the screens in the kids field of vision then scan it [Music] that's it there was someone in the store that shot him his own jumbo shot oh damn he planned to all along must have got a nice slice of crap on the black market for a bd like this bd freaks are ready to pay a prem for a real flatline anyway if you've seen enough you can exit that's awesome it's really cool yeah it's impressive right it's too bad most of the bds we do here are only good for flogging the log anyway you ready to do this look at your wreck don't know why let's take a break still feel like that kid when oh yeah i think i'm done v there's no time get it together please okay okay go ahead just need t-bug to link in whoa whoa whoa whoo running for my crew security specialist she'll tell me what to look for while we analyze no problem i hope actually it is a problem not what we agreed ev judy t-bug's a professional discreet to a fault you can trust her why cause you say so please judy i'd never expose you to any danger you know that okay call t-bug and we'll dive in get t-bug let's go hey bug what's up hey v what's happening bug listen i got some useful footage from kenpecki plaza it's a brain dance con peki oh thought as much someone there with you judy and evelyn yeah judy and evelyn they're chill they're helping me work through this bd uh-huh all right you gonna tell me what this is about listen need your help got no clue what to look for once i'm in all right see if i can walk you through it jacking it to your tech now you've got to give me access opening port 1779 secure protocol good i'm going in should be getting my requests now got it you ready a millisecond okay connection confirmed now some quick tip ice and we're clear ready to dance fire up judy i just invited t to the game basically he has joined your party what happened there eyes open gotta find out where your note was keeping the relic [Music] i felt a fear sure got it under control quick too i said no they'll have my head for this then you shall perish for a good cause but make yourself comfortable i need a minute listen in on that conversation v could be something important i need a minute to finish the program is still in the trial phase we cannot take it to market as is we shall see soon enough please speak with your father he's taken a particular interest in this project he can certainly explain the risks of the tired vision this old gray beard who thinks nothing will change and he'll live forever in his tiny frozen bubble i should not even be listening to such things you will listen to this sabroi's an adult despot oddly removed from reality stuck in some fossilized vision of a world that no longer exists of a world that may never have existed we have not seen eye to eye for the past 20 years i am quite sure we want now read the documentation carefully the relic requires specific storage conditions you must provide them if you've heard that relic docks gotta be around here somewhere look for them well i gotta find the relic dock switch layers playback mode is everything all right you seem tense edgy a moment it will pass i can get to work on that just one condition why can i scan the data pad now i don't know where it is maybe it's further on in the recording you wish to make demands of me only one focus on me oh got any candy left stuff was pretty fun last time maybe i missed it i can't scan it there couldn't scan it when it was on the desk either bedroom nightstand i've got an idea be right back i like this [Music] if i can get it there yeah details a special tip controlled container relic needs to be kept real cool so chip's got to stay in the freezer yep could damage it otherwise okay switch on thermal layer detection in the editor should be easier to spot where you are know who's keeping the chip thermal layer oh man i don't see it anywhere yet [Music] i miss this you i know [Music] this trippy one that's out of the range there's something going on there i miss this [Music] let's go back in the recording maybe to that earlier one something there in the champagne and ice bucket is that it oh donaghy's no it's like mr arasaka had something to celebrate you really think you'll find the chip in there no way tim's too low could fluctuate nice try though let's go further we'll be right at the start i don't even know what that thing is but it's horrible like a security drone or something military grade cyberware detected extreme caution advice it's the alarm system alarm firmware is fresh but saw excited birds chirping on a bbs something about lots of seeds falling to this sieve let me generate keys i can forge their six it wasn't hiding it in that dude there the program is still in the trial phase it's too far i missed it yeah i'm not sure where it is unless it's on the table you speak with your father found it in there just a fancy ass fridge just to find sass fridge tip doesn't match the guidelines won't find a thing here he's taken a particular interest in this project
