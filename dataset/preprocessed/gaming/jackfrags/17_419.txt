incoming well this is going to be fun imagine if it was just 150 people flying towards you oh no we're slowing in the air so you're literally go you're ruined guys it's very cinematic actually it's quite cool i'm just in the sky guys we're just floating in the sky yeah walking on clouds oh hey look at this start look at this this is top content nothing anywhere so i'm basically going to be your guide dog for this game i'm like leading you you're the sherpa yeah i'm leading the blind i wonder if it'll let me see people through walls um it will but you can't shoot them i'm pretty sure and then you know this is the matrix yeah that do you know why they think this is that this is like lowest lod at all ranges yeah lod everything's fine everything's fine close this if this is on fire all right let's get it done i'm so oh i'm running into things i can't see yeah i can't your guide dog has died uh you're gonna have to wait a minute we've got nothing left we need guns the smoke is low poly is that a contract it is it's the supply run oh they're right there so i can't see them might i don't even have armor plates they're not like clear they're not real ninja box oh what's this oh ginger crate i can't even see half the stuff that fell out of it there's a field upgrade there that's invisible ammo here it's invisible that's right invisible ammo yeah is everything is invisible dude it's very strange oh no jackman this is really testing our knowledge of warzone now isn't it yeah you can just jump over this is uh cyberpunk on the ace xbox one we we won a game of wars there on cyberpunk this is what it looks like wall here isn't it yeah i can see all the stairs down there and everything in the subway station oh my god it must be gl this is how i find the easter eggs is it i wonder

building all right there's something blocking me there nothing on heartbeat anymore this is like playing in on drugs lsd lsd's on [ __ ] thumbing yeah there's a thing there oh and there's the man he's on the roof he's on the roof tv tv sweat is he on the race is that a plant pot oh floating bottles gas mask that is the lowest quality gas mask it looks like psycho mantis from metal gear solid right guys we're going to choose our next our next thing to do we use legit cheats in warzone there you go there you go i mean i could see that guy through the wall you could yeah because there wasn't a helicopter there so i could i couldn't shoot him but i could see him so you could just predict his movement and then just be like oh yeah but we also have the we we have played to guess where the helicopter was our disadvantage is that we can't see walls so they could just pick a wall and we don't know it's there and also we can't see trees what is this what what's up ahead of us here a tree gigantic tree and hills that's a gigantic tree it's a giant egg disregard that it looks like floating monsters oh no we've come to the edge where we can't climb this is the sea of despair the sea of discomfort follow stodd follow stud stop it go to train through train roof because then we can actually find there i'm getting a header plain roof yeah yeah hit three oh respawn or bed oh yeah get another tree right up there's it go on there is a little wall but you can run on it i think you can run up it yeah you can there's no there's no okay i don't know where the cover is there's no boxes enemy soldiers are you on the right i had a what's wrong with my gun it's making the wrong sounds there's no ac vents at all why it's like there's an ac vent right in front of you what do you mean

thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like and a comment down below thank you and also if you pick anything up in the cod store like the battle pass for season 2 or any skins or blueprints consider using my code jack frags in all caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that and if you do buy something tweet me a picture the same as all these guys have here just a nice way to
