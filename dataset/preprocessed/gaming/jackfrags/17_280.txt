the cx-9 is finally here they've gone and done it i don't believe it i thought we'd never see the day it only took him about 10 years but it's here this was a big surprise last night suddenly out of nowhere the soap operator bundle appeared in the store in that was the cerak which is a cx-9 blueprint and if you want to you can just unlock the gun normally pretty easy to do it's just two long shots in five different matches in modern warfare for whatever reason though it was just unlocked for me by default i didn't have to unlock it it was just there and i could start customizing it straight away and let me tell you it was an absolute joy to level up a gun in modern warfare again way more enjoyable than the cold war weapons that just seem to take ages and ages playing newtown 24 7. even with double xp it goes on forever but i just whacked on the double xp token loaded shipment 24 7 and in less than an hour i'd actually maxed it out all the way up to level 57 i think it's the max so that was great and i've been playing with it today tried some trios and quads earlier in the morning bit of rebirth as well as some solos and you're about to see a solo gameplay using this as my primary weapon the stats of it are good and it looks like they've nerfed it a bit from when it was last in the game you know how there was a couple weeks where you could just randomly find this in supply crates on the ground it was devastating then but now they've changed the stats of it it's not quite as good i don't think it's going to replace the ots9 the mac 10 or the bullfrog because those guns have as good as if not slightly better stats than this and of course the cold war smg's give you a ton more mobility so i don't think the cx-9 is going to compete in the long term but it's really fun to just use a new modern warfare gun again and there's a couple different builds with this too that make it interesting and this is what i went for in the game that i'm about to show you guys if you want to check it out you can tweak the barrel stock suppressor if you want you can put sleight of hand on there and you actually get a one second reload which is one of the fastest in the game so plenty of options here for builds 50 round mag is the max though on this and the damage does drop off quite harshly up close it's a machine but medium to longer ranges it's not going to be quite as competitive as you'd like it to be so here we go then this game has an interesting ending let's go with that i'll drop to the superstore because i just never dropped there in solos i landed on the roof and for some reason decided to shoot the glass out and alert me to that position pretty easy kill there picked up that nice mac 10 as well noticed a bit of movement there behind that pickup truck thing it's not a pickup truck thing is it it's a a crate lifter that kill was stolen there by that dude little guy here hiding in the door so i went for a big flank listening out sneaky beaky trying to hear footsteps and they run across to the right there i want this kill they stole my kill so i'm gonna steal this it's only fair two in the bag so far i'm gonna go around collecting money already got 10k so i moved up to the buy here notice someone on the heartbeat sensor and i heard them climbing up the ladder listen out see if you can hear it when i get a bit closer to the building there we go so i know that they're at the top i've just got to figure out which side they're on right above me now on that top floor quietly open the door wait for the angle there it is unfortunately that stuff is bulletproof so when someone's up there it's really hard to hit them well getting that final crate there picking up the satchel and we've got 18 grand looking good so far right got my loadout and i'm just hunting now spotted a guy over here really bad timing that was they jump out get the kill i'm on like one hp there it's really bad i think i'm very lucky to get away with that one i spent all my money on a uav and a loadout i thought i'd go for that you know if i had to hit that shot that would have been so great and someone just done misses shoots me in the back twice and i'm sure they were gonna push here and i went under there just in case they dropped down and go over my head but this person's got ghosts so they got their loadout guns they dropped down missed me a bit i take advantage and michi is not happy with that one i mean again it was one of those fights where i just went down to like one hp but they played that well you know i think just maybe missed a few of the opening shots there and over here the second loadout had come in and i'm just checking around because that loadout is in such an awkward spot i hate that the car goes past i'm waiting to see i thought that might be the other loadout that's there but it wasn't something exploded so there might be someone in police or on the roof here a bit of a risk this one i don't want to take it right now so i head backwards and there just happens to be a guy there running right up to me and the cx-9 definitely makes a short work of people at that kind of distance you know you throw a few headshots in there and it's gg pretty much gone to the uav i marked it as well in case the uav runs out and at the moment they're on my level they go up to the roof on the uav and they're shooting at someone else so that's a good opportunity there for me to get the ghost switch out the guns put that streller down i want the cx-9 so i'm getting a building a little bit of mad max going on here trucking attack rover having a dance truck gets out something explodes there's gunfire something on the right of me there that's weird and someone's definitely won that fight nothing on heartbeat but i wanted to stay see if they came running over i'm gonna have a p there we go now i'm just being patient here waiting for the shot check the gap no they keep running are they gonna go for the car no they keep running didn't want to expose myself just quietly jump out here ghosted player i'm gonna chill in this corner and just be patient just wait and see what they do because i want them to get in the car that's what they do get that swiss out line up the shot there it is they had to sell fresh but i'm not going to miss that follow up there again farming those uavs as much as i can this dude just dropped in but i know there's a load of loot there because that fight that just went down so i have to be a bit cautious i can't just run into this it could be the person that died there before maybe they already had their loadout they've got decent guns there i don't know and there was someone over to the southeast there thinking about crossing over so i'm staying in the bush they've moved to that hangar there i don't want to take that shot because the person next to me in the building is going to hear that they're going to know that i'm here and here i'm using the sound of the airstrike to just move in a bit more quicker right above me edging slowly forward trying to not make any footstep sounds so bit by bit we go up the stairs they're right above me there and even if they've got a heartbeat you know this person doesn't know that i'm here get the peak there's the angle get the take out very nice cx-9 performing admirably in those kind of situations head out onto the roof this lobby died real quick pay attention to that real quick i'm being hunted it's this guy over here they're in the other building i expected them to go up to the roof so i'm just playing it cautiously let's have a look yeah and they peak at just the right moment and i wanted to go for the flick shot there i noticed there was a gap there too in between the acs you see that i didn't know that was there be a good little spot they put a cluster on me let's just get away pop the daddy if they're rushing over they're not gonna have heard that probably didn't see me either i just flip out the heartbeat to see if they're chasing let's have a peek on the roof and they've moved to the right bit different and that was a headshot but because i shot through the glass didn't get a kill follow-up was pretty simple though quite straightforward recoup check out where the zone's going loot up a bit 10 grand in the bag car was coming over i wanted this kill missed the first missed the follow-ups with the cx-9 missed the second i wanted that one i really wanted that one just waiting for that perfect shot and as doctor strange would say we're in the end game now i'm looking for pigs rosie over here runs over wrong place wrong time gotta get that player out of the lobby i simply must rush in it i don't think they were even attempting to sell for us for some reason maybe they just knew i was gonna push but i had that kill either way now pay attention pay close attention to what happens next i've got to move and there's someone in pd in police they're there lots of damage straightaway now before i show you what happens next we're just gonna watch that shot back in slow motion because my bullet goes clear through that player's head that's a clear-cut headshot in my opinion but it just didn't register for whatever reason okay so continuing i've just been down let's see what happens i start self-pressing and i hear them run into the building they're coming to try and finish the kill but i thought okay instead i'm going to dead silence i'm going to go to where they were that's quite an unpredictable play not many people would read that but they were ready it's a kill cam [Applause] just really great prediction skills guys very well played anyway i hope you enjoy the rest of the video drop a like down below in a comment i'll see you next time [Applause] whoops
