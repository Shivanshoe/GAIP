hi everyone and welcome back to more call of duty warzone today we're playing with study the tactical brit and mr pro westy and we're going to be using the growl today i wanted to test in this current meta of augs m16s ffar the amax does the max damage growl still compete so this is the loadout i've got the mono on the front on the muzzle and this is one of the most important things here the tempest archangel barrel and that's really going to extend that maximum damage range come out of four grips 60 round mags and the rubber grip i haven't gone for the sack laser so this will be an absolute beam but can it put the kind of damage out that i want to compete i don't know we'll have to wait and see but we'll be playing for a couple hours today and i'm pairing that with the mac 10 in my ghost loadout first is overkill second time we'll get ghost and that's how i've got the mag built yeah i've not really used the ground in a while so i thought give it a shot see how it is should be good i'm expecting that i'm gonna get melted by ffars unless i use my mac 10. it'll be an interesting experiment anyway what's up guys thank you for coming along to the stream today i appreciate you

sorry doesn't mean one hdr image i've got grab today [Applause] i want to see if it still works it does still work do you like the short answer or the long answer jack sure answered absolutely not we'll see it we'll see that live that's that's a lie i mean if you run a long range growl with like a short range mac 10 yeah that's exactly what i'm doing well then there you go i think it's all about positioning and if i position myself well i can beam people with it yeah this game is positioning and also bunny hopping this game is positioned to me in the fetal position to cry there's a cod channel daddy battlefield save me no espn m zone please yes come on let's do it yeah game changers i want you back just an email please the last thing you sent me was sims 4 and i nearly cried please please let me chill for you again oh gosh oh we got a team over there lovely let's go over there baby let's get involved we're killing them we're killing them [Applause] that's allowed that's allowed that's a lad wait for the lad i would also like to support lacking i would like to support well what you do is you go to youtube they're on green right now membership they're they're on this side they're getting the load shame you can't use your amazon prime on youtube it's two down [Applause] there running lucky [Applause] he is he's in the last house at the back on green last guy thrust them all down yeah 19 oh no no there's a guy not in here in here in here there's two is that another there was a guy above okay i don't know where this guy is killed a lot of geezers so there really shouldn't be yeah in there 30 meters [Music] he's in here he's in here anyone i got a daddy i got a daddy grenade no one up there granada he probably doesn't know that you had a heartbeat sensor cam that's probably why he called you yeah exactly that's run out i think he's legged it yeah unless he was in the sky that guy maybe he came up on my heartbeat as well though my heartbeat doesn't lie dd's what it is uh uav [Applause] [Music] all right this is gonna be a good game because i've got nine kills already because it's a bronze five yeah the rest of you can just sort of do your thing we'll just support right let's go back down promenade that's where the action is going to be um is there one there yeah time to murder them relocating what are you running today lucky uh for far cry 98 okay so they're better they're all better i'm sorry i'll just stop are we going to get to a point now where people didn't realize that using suppressors on guns that don't really need them it's going to be actually good again no i think as soon as they fix the attachments everyone will go back yeah absolutely because it it is still the better option to use the suppressors like that absolutely i don't understand why the monolithic it gives you so many why is it so powerful yeah why oh they've just rest here on the bike uh i feel like if you get a philip velocity you should have to risk something else but no yep mono is just like everything inside yeah he's going inside there's one other one as well just in front of you i mean that's mental uh nothing on heartbeat footsteps i'm hearing extra footsteps somewhere maybe lucky something is though uh i'm not seeing you relocating the safe zone okay maybe i'm just hearing your footsteps it could have run away there was a guy somewhere north west you go get our ghosts yeah yeah get ghost god if you get a uav maybe or something yeah i don't see anyone on the roof dead body up there but nothing else all right there's loads of dead bodies over here yeah he must run all the way along [Music] the only thing about modern warfare guns now is he runs he runs so slowly or i can tonight i can snipe i no tags [Music] they should have like um because if you think about the balance track no one uses any other suppressor because it's in like it's the best attachment bonus yeah and it shouldn't be like that because it should have like a negative to it like oh you get all this bullet velocity and range i used to have the mini map in war zone yep here i don't think it's yeah i think it needs to be rebalanced heartbeating medical supplies here it'll be those guys cam and fire station yeah yeah yeah thank you guys again by the way you killed three times in a row yeah oh god follow them through the bat do you want to get a uav quickly you two should have enough money jack westy hang on uh beans i'm taking five down here [Applause] yeah i'm watching in case they go up or down 47 meters southwest 200. they're inside the club one could be parachute i mean i've already um killed or down one sorry no 28 meters in here is it just one no there's one blip on the heartbeat but it could be more than one because it could have a ghosted player it could also be self-rest yeah he could have self-rest no i don't think so these are fresh uav uav anyone uav that'd be a good time for it uh down to uv damn enough for it okay oh there you go but someone threw a decoy they're green moving here so where are they i don't know frankie benny's maybe there we go yeah frankie and benny's they just called him an airstrike here he's got right shield going around behind him has he gone in he went in [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] cheetahs is there a team like that uh yeah i think maybe not should we go should we should we mean this lad could do found a hilo you get some money out of him big jungus it's like a pinata warzone pinata if you thank him explode explode it will come back around this way in a second and that's what that's when you want to murder it that's when no one on uav at all brilliant meme if it lands on you does it kill you yep yeah it can it can smash into you it can also kill you when it appears out of the ground oh good i think lackey's been on the receiving end of that i yeah i had one come out of the ground and down the inside what do you mean it just spawns out yeah it just kills let's be honest guys none of the warzone tournaments are proper official ones run by activision well so the toronto ultra is cdl so it is like you know they're not just pulling underground put them all in a private

oh sniper head of you snipe ahead of you i'll drive i'm from roughly just past the gas station where can i even go here uh oh my bike is it glitched yeah it's the big lift i don't want to go in there i'll pick i don't like this game what happened every time i jump off of a high place i spam parachute and it never goes i always literally as soon as i i always jump i never fall off so whenever i uh i'm always further away from the cover because sometimes if you're too close to the cover it might let you pull your parachute yeah so i always jump out and away from it come on try and then spam the button uh there's people on the bowman's jacks yeah jack i'll just drive around you basically you're playing solos now well i need to kill someone just so i can get money i need a squad like or something you need to third party something oh yeah no not like this oh no i think you're good it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah how many are left 27 are you kidding 27 yes they're all in prison aren't they oh here oh yeah oh oh oh oh [Applause] [Music] that was a meme round got dunked on from start to finish lord lord not even lying we did actually get dunked on from start to finish have you ever had a zone that ends at the ship is that possible uh i mean i guess so yeah i haven't seen one end there do they have pre-configured zones i don't know sometimes it feels like they do not sure well i didn't have any teammates left then did i crazy uh yeah this is live armada hey frankie draws what's up hey king god hope you're having a good stream i am king thank you appreciate you being a member big pog [Music] unfortunately we couldn't do it that time i'm gonna try that thing with the knife though like they were saying i don't know if you guys picked up on it or maybe you weren't here in the stream but they said that if someone does a takedown on you and you have a knife in your hand a throwing knife you actually counter the takedown i've never seen anything like that i've never heard that before i don't i've never seen that animation or it's cool i'd love to test that out see what that looks like it's a very very particular circumstance i don't think you would have the the presence of mind to do it in a split second when you knew someone was about to do a takedown on you uh but i'd love to see it so what i might do afterwards is uh get a mate and join a game and see if we can see what that animation looks like because that sounds super cool play time's over yeah the ground was working pretty good then lots of damage just got ruined at the end hello francis from saudi arabia thank you for tuning in there's an easter egg in shipwreck i imagine there's loads over there mike yeah i know there's the zombies thing [Music] battle royale set a drop point for your team soldier gas is approaching your position move to the safe zone uh cody thanks for becoming a member matty thank you for the five you got platinum snipers and marksman rifles today i don't want to do the right shield troy thompson thank you for becoming a member cody thank you i see him thanks for the 100 thank you for making my hectic study schedule a bit smoother from india thank you man deacon brandon thank you for becoming members niall thanks for the 20 gaming citizen and cosmic again thank you very much [Music] what's up we're going for the guy doing the finishing move just dies because your throwing knife falls out your hand and sometimes hits them oh so it's not it's not a mechanic then it's a bug it's what you're saying it's not a special animation it's just like uh the throwing knife just leaves your character and hits them you saw a tick tock about it okay it isn't an animation right i thought they were saying it's like a special animation but i get it now so it's kind of like a bug where the second the control is taken away from your character because of the takedown animation starting the knife just throws out of your hand and has the potential to kill the person doing the takedown that's what you're saying right i get it now kind of ashamed that that's not a mechanic but that's interesting as well is that loadout acquired i believe it may be already yeah loadout required yeah yes sweet let's go straight to the place floaty spagody i was just asking my chat about that knife animation thing you said apparently what it is is because you've got to throw a knife in your hand yeah it just throws it the second they start to do the takedown there isn't like a special animation or anything oh cause i've found it i've never seen an animation yeah i've seen an animation for it around 400 sure you actually like the guy turns around and turns around and shifts them like a counter in bf4 it's actually a proper animation okay it's super rare though because obviously who's going to have their knife out and all this kind of crap me every time somebody comes near me i saw people using knives in the tournament yesterday don't know why because they're getting very nice they get the finish yeah quick finish yeah you just why wouldn't you use a thermite because it takes longer don't know instagram as well you damage yourself you can pick up the knife afterwards as well you can just stick them with it i never would have thought throwing knife would actually be better it's not meta but yeah whatever but as i'm oh when you get 20 diamond lobbies in a row and the person who won the tournament ends up getting mostly gold salad in a basket stick them all in the same lobby your operator plays an uno reverse card that's a good way to burn it an uno three haircuts broke and down we go thank you just don't explode lacquer the devil see man here i'm just chilling on the outside there's a couple in there there's two i got you jack thank you yeah i need to see a video of it i got you i got you sounds super cool though unfortunately i don't have i'll send this back and we're done with the ram they're in the small side cubby on [Applause] lucky i've got eight bullets in the temple oh jacks jackie yeah yeah knee single way oh no i've got 15 bucks shoot the zombies never mind it doesn't give you the ammo got no place no fans no ground you do get ammo drops from the zombies you do that's my finish okay one not for me [Applause] are you guys in the ship yes yeah there's still a royal skin on top [Applause] i don't have any ar ammo i'm i'm gonna have to try and quick scope them with an hdr it's not gonna go well above please melt in here yeah and there's another guy shooting us as well it's two geezers yeah we can't really fight this i've literally got zero ammo [Applause] i got ammo what so i'm gonna give me yeah i've got 80 bullets okay drop me something come in here a jump thank you do you take those that's good that's good that'll do one jump together for the head aim for the head enemy position i've just got loads of them i just zombie trains like [Applause] is it going to be a salad in a pasty no it's a big gas mask one of them and one of them we can do it again if you want should we do it again yeah i've got the ammo now let's do it again you still got the geezers above you that's fine one of them dropped off we still got the helium horrible noises yeah look loads of ammo drops for you maybe you're looking down here i'm collecting it all just got cash so you can get 4k from doing this basically it's not on you [Applause] there's a man why don't they have lights on oh my far's glitch it's stuck in this crate yeah i've got full ammo now so i don't know what you're on about all right well you won i think if you use an ar to kill the zombies it drops ar ammo for you yeah that's right yeah yay did i get it no i didn't go someone did i got it can you leave the zombies out into the map i guess you could let's just try something next episode we have a loadout money by the way we've got a free one there's a buy here yeah let's see if i can do it let's do it again [Applause] how far can we take him jack watch out for the watch out for the water jack watch out for the water okay i'm getting my ammo slowly now yeah how far could you make the dogs out oh they get stuck yeah they can't go any zombie in a further i mean we could all get a gas mask for self-resistance if we keep doing that yeah why not i mean why shouldn't we please go baby we'll just be the zombie killers you can farm ammunition when you can farm plates you got a hundred dollars per zombie i mean i'm on 50 kill you know 50 kills records round of applause i get that one [Applause] you saved the helicopter lucky yeah

golden gas mask i've got mine i could check us oh there you go drop jack money though you need jack's money yeah i don't think you can do it i think because you take more damage out of the gas now is

shot thank you i'm hit look no they're not bad they're not bad nearby so this guy is there somewhere i'm getting off the road move these move let's see look he's moving a little problem is we can't peak because of these guys on the if you see 20 meters enemy mark you get him down [Applause] expired we lost the target is he on you downstairs what the hell your footsteps here oh cj okay nope in here lucky he went this way his bounty symbol twitched this way maybe he went down onto the ground probably did i'm not seeing the atc guys speak again should we get out here it's pretty horrible all right someone just remembers they present it's probably the it's the thing we got isn't it see if we can get the guy coming in i mean as much as you've got the guy's guy's already coming he's already coming as much as i think we should get out here we're also middle of the zone let's hold here then not a great spot though is it when atc are looking out like that there's people shooting down from the hill already oh yeah there was the people remember the people all the way over there there's no helicopters you see either one [Music] i think they are 80 cd all right they might have been there still up there it's the same um they may have all gone except for him they just split [Applause] we got one of them did you finish these things we finished it there's there's more shots coming from up the hill still as well you're trying to attack me in the tower yeah if you go down remember oh you got himself yeah i got a selfie i'm good [Applause] he's trying real hard there's a recon flag here that's probably what they were going for i guess probably illegally uh illegally illegally not seen the move [Applause] they can't really do much up there no no oh god look at the zone [Applause] coming in finishing over here then should i run to you orange is a good place to be well let's go then orange i'll see if this guy's glad you came over here [Applause] orange you glad i did this has all been looted here someone might have dropped there earlier or used the train maybe [Applause] when did that other player go which one the one that we were sniping when they were crossing over yeah i could wait i killed the other one you killed the other one you got him there's no one on this side of the circle still 45 as well that's crazy yeah they're all going to go for us yeah they're all going to come through airport i reckon they're all going to come through airport where do you think the lift shaft is the shot i could wallbang him underneath oh someone's shooting in front of the hill just here [Applause] i'm just shooting out the windows there you go shout out to police police enemy uav guys i'm a break down stand him down the second one down another i'm also being shot from atc another one [Music] one step one going up the ladder [Applause] one tried going up the ladder i downed them let's do to the right west be careful seemed like lol he was hiding there yeah he tried he tried to shotgun me bless him he only had it he just jumped okay he cracks you crack it have no vision there's a sexual there if needed i dropped the plate box and there's another side [Music] oh my god what the hell i'm behind cover i'm behind the hill i'm behind the healthcare i'm getting your kids we have work to do he's he's got no glint on his sniper because there was literally no glint there he'll be going as well yeah he's in green somewhere i've got a view on this guy [Applause] should be able to see that if you push up a bit if we go up and around lucky come with me you only down that with the guy jack right you didn't yeah down down didn't finish i have an idea i'll take the high ground i reckon if we just go here we'll see him isn't there people up here no the people that we've just killed were the ones that were sniping down towards these guys i think jack's right i think if you get this angle here you should be able to look down onto the valley we've only got we've only got 20 seconds and we have to move and we've got quite a long way to go absolutely nothing they've gone there they've gone oh further down blood why did that zone bounce so far south that's weird atc yeah yeah there's ground that marcus we could take the hilltop they're jumping i don't know about this position guys this is a really shy position yeah we have to we have to flank around and get out the hill so we need to like go up here up to blue along the hill and then we can move it's not a great position to run out in the open but i don't know i'm saying where we were before it's horrible oh yeah that was all covered this is the atc i'm gonna keep this car nice here cheeky i think you need it for this song yeah it'd be picked up copy your mark we have to shillam and kim this i've got the presence of mind on the cut on the hd you can hold your breath car on purple yeah he's uh he's the king he's moving [Music] yeah just stick to this top side of the mountain i absolutely despise these kind of zones they're not great at pogba it's never about the team who makes the intelligent flank or anything it's who sees you first jackie just slammed into the ground that guy yeah someone smacked him i'ma hit that guy the tent on green i'm moving it should still be another team back there i reckon there should be loads of teams running from atc jack the travel time on that that was a long shot i'm gonna hold purple oh they're behind us guys they're coming along the same route down on the bridge i've got a hill what are they doing they've made mistakes here they're gonna have to run through the gas as well hit the king hit the king did he drop down disabled vehicle he'll have to jump out yeah do you guys want to maybe get yeah they're hugging the cliff there loadout giving giving cliff a quick hug oh guys i've got ghosts i'm yeah i've already got ghosts yeah i remember this final zone from a few weeks ago oh god yeah we're only 200 meters away yeah pull back okay yeah pull back pull back just hold the tree line as much as you can hold the tree line are you being shot from another team as well moving position yeah from the top of the airport airport roof airport one down oh we've got snipers as well yeah they've got no glimpse just here on green okay they've stunned they push it close pushing close 1500 oh oh that's annoying as well we've got three different angles here we've been shot from this is not that dude and we've got players coming in too broke him he boy's got this he's got a dmr he's on his own stud let's [Applause] as well he's got dmi i'll just steam you [Laughter] i think they i think they're screwed here it's that team to the left has got the zone and if they're good shots we've got no reason to not kill him i want him to win though starts playing well i know they're down there you know what to do two e3 yeah they've got the zone they've got the positioning it's going to be very difficult for him to win this one of the teams from airport wasn't it yeah probably yeah but the zone kept bouncing south there was no reason to believe it would go north again just one of those annoying circles where actually it's better not to be up on the hill you mean to tell me that there are annoying circles where it decides to not choose an actual viable location where people can fight properly correct really locations like downtown and you end up fighting somewhere like that out in the sticks all right i'm gonna go grab a drink i'll be right back start actually looking game botty he's just good he's just very good gaming citizen thanks for the two deakin brandon thanks again for becoming members michael c thanks for coming member ken true king thank you very much guys yeah tough games today big difference from last night yeah starti's very good player fatima yeah he's very good yeah the zone was a bit shady now just out on the top of a hill but yeah everyone's in the same boat it's just sometimes you get screwed that's warzone you know that's about royale games in it as part of the appeal though too i think like why they're fun to play because it's challenging at times right if you get a bad shift you've got to try and make that work for your team [Applause] i tried to use the cbr in a game about a month ago when i was just recording by myself [Applause] hello it's um it takes sniper ammo i think that's the problem with it you know when when you put it up against the dmr or the type there's nowhere near as good recall on it as well it's crazy bounces up like a madman [Applause] contact very high damage though couldn't get away with it i tried can we see the ground loader i showed it i've showed it a few times already you can skip back on the stream as well and have a look there you go my boss got it thank you potato steam what's up steven yeah i got stuck on that rock as well when the guy started shooting me in the back i don't think i would have survived anyway but at least i would have had a chance to get up and move we're doing train all right be here [Music] the wave [Applause] he's [Applause] oh no no well there's another one with a dmrt god damn it i actually managed to get a couple there don't worry lads i'm coming oh lord he's coming downstairs and get a drink [Applause] i'm preparing to fight one more here no no [Laughter] the tactical drink is back [Applause] i do just wrecked him lucky i'm coming listen up soldier can we still get the flag or is it going nice i hate this ma2 you're up soldier now go sort this [ __ ] out [Applause] uh put the gun down just use the fist it's fine works best [Music] are we clear here yeah we got a load out okay we got loadout and westeros you want to get that recon uh forget the recon there's a team that way okay and you want to get picked up [Applause] [Applause] is what is the fascination about being picked up by an esports or money it's just salaried isn't it it's a salary position right i think i can only understand some of the steam with it maybe i just didn't understand the fascination i was like money plates [Applause] okay i need them it's fine to my channel run away oh god that's another guy he didn't make a sound he had dead fire there's another guy behind me oh my god what the hell we've been completely surrounded what the hell yeah and they both pushed us at the same time because uh here's the grow loadout that i'm using mono suppressor archangel barrel commander 4 grip 60 round mag you could go 50 if you want a bit more mobility you could also put tack laser on if you want that quicker radius speed but i don't think you need it so i've gone with the rubber grip instead just helps a little bit with the recoil control you could go for a stock but it's already like quite easy to control it so i don't think you need it oh that's the build a mac 10 build when the suppressors are fixed that's going to change back to that most likely the attachments for the black ops weapons are broken right now so don't you if you're using a black ops weapon it's going to be a lot better if you don't put a suppressor on it check it out why is everyone suddenly using the a-max uh matthew the a-max has been better for a while now it's very good it's like incredibly high damage that's the thing with the air max [Music] [Applause] it's a beam as well like if you put the right attachments on the air max you get the uh commando four bro zodiac barrel monolithic suppressor that's really fun try that in the game uh george thank you for the five what would you what would be my ideal tesco meal deal i need to know this all right i don't know i like their chicken salad baguette i think that's quite nice pacquiao monster munch and maybe a packet of maltesers something like that uh bougaine thanks for the five from texas what's up booger thank you man that's kinda yeah i think the air max has got like one of the best body shot damage for the assault rifles in the game it's very good for your team soldier do you want to do like a stadium and get a free loadout let's do it guys why not there might be a lot of drop in here [ __ ] nation where is the uh executive officer is it this side is that where the window is i'm pretty sure yeah i'm trying to get in the window i'm going to go to the bar down here uh there's no window oh i missed yeah i got two guys already everyone knows about this already jack it's not a cheat code anymore there's no gear in the executors at all oh they were taking it out there's nothing oh yeah there you go it's because you went to the wrong place folks is that the executive office are you watch out cam is on the left there i'll fly sachi hello try the other side armor here he's not here jack he's gone uh zachary all here if anybody wants that enemy

there more here it's the perfect timing of war zone isn't it lucky [Applause] anymore jack [Applause] a guy just tried to shoot me stud if you drop me your money back you took so long aiming it was weird from g hey yes how many pcs do you reckon you guys have built throughout the years way too many um yeah it will take a lot of people like in my chat talking about like building or versus a pre-built it's like if you can build a pc you have to fix it and if you could build a pc you could build a type 22 machine gun if you can do that you're in the royal navy i'll tell you what at the moment you might find it's actually cheaper to buy a pre-built though because yeah the pricing of all of the equipment imagine if i was sponsored by a pre-built uh yeah pc company imagine imagine if you could type exclamation mark pcs wow that would be crazy wow that would be crazy stuff that would actually give me that hog i'm gonna take one of you to the other satchel uh there's a guy blinking what what just happened what was a guy just in the sky above the tower over here he was just hovering there and he was just blinking in out in out in out and out and out and then just fit it's a glitch probably pop in this little side window um that isn't going to go well i'll take it yeah yeah that isn't bigger zipline and if you head around to the small room around the left there'll be a satchel in there there's no satchel there anymore oh they dug it when you've been ruined anymore wonderful let's go to bro this one this one this one and then zoom and then push or drop one of us on there and then push for me down one one of them just got pushed they have an airstrike did you push another team [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i might have been on bank he just screamed down the bike it was happy was it oh very the first one decided to call me a big old slur and then the one after that it's just things you love to find in warzone oh the helicopter would have lived as well but the helicopter died so we could survive that's it bf5 died so about one could live this guy is using a car 98 without a monolithic suppressor okay he has ruined himself i'm pretty sure there's some kind of crime what are we looking at down there jack it was just a respawn [Applause] i don't know who was shooting started when he parachuted i can't see a team from yeah we have to have somewhere someone parachute and i just saw a shadow was that one of you okay why was it over there that's weird uh i think there's action at hospital actually nothing i ain't seen nothing i don't see nothing and up we go [Music] yeah it's the unreleased weapon you can't create a build of it yet no you can't put it in your loadout it's sick though it's going to be full method behind the wall bouncing behind us is
