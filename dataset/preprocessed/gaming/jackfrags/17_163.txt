if you've been playing a lot of bf 2042 recently you may have noticed that people seem to know where you are a lot of the time that's because there are a lot and i mean a lot of ways that you can get spotted on the minimap and 3d spotted without you knowing it for several seconds at a time when you take into consideration that there could be 64 people potentially playing against you you should assume that you are permanently spotted in this video myself animate hats did a bit of testing and you're going to see some surprising things and when you do your experience of the game might start making much more sense to you and we're starting with suppressors and this is a bit mad now there are four suppressors in the game at the moment for primary weapons the 6ku wrapped type 4 and pb heavy every one of these suppressors says that a positive of using them is that there is no minimap spotting for you when firing that's not actually true though either the description or the attachment is not functioning correctly let's have a look then as a baseline if you don't have a suppressor on your gun and you shoot you will be spotted on the minimap whilst you're shooting and for about five seconds after you stop shooting as we can demonstrate here line of sight does not seem to make a difference either five seconds guys after you stop shooting keep that in mind that's a long time now then pb heavy suppressor on had shoots no minimap spot type four suppressor on he shoots no minimap spot seems to be working correctly how about the rap suppressor had shoots and he's on the minimap for five seconds what about the 6k u he shoots guess what he's on the minimap that's weird and it doesn't line up with the description in the customization menu we tested this with the m5 assault rifle and lcmg as well as some smg's same behavior rapton 6ku suppressor both put you on the minimap when you shoot and some guns only let you pick those two suppressors however there is a caveat to this check this out we discovered that if you're over 10 meters away from the target the raptan u suppressors don't put you on the minimap when you shoot so there is a distance element here but that isn't explained in the menu so i think a lot of players have been left scratching their heads when they get pre-fired and tracked because they thought that all of the suppressors stopped you from appearing on the minimap when firing and as you can see in this clip i can only see heads on the minimap here when i get within that 10 meter range also line of sight doesn't appear to have an impact here either so those two suppressors the wrapped and the 6k u only conceal you on the minimap if the enemy is more than 10 meters away my personal expectation with this is that all of the suppressors in the game should take you off the minimap when firing but after testing this isn't the case and it isn't explained well in the game i don't know if dice are aware of this i assume they are but hopefully it's looked into and clarified next other ways that you can be spotted boris turrets these will spot you for four seconds on the minimap and give you a proper 3d spot which can be seen through walls if you're close to the edge of an object it can sometimes spot you there too smoke appears to prevent the turret from spotting you though so that could be an interesting counter play if you're stuck additionally standing in a smoke grenade and firing prevents you from appearing on the minimap even when using a loud weapon as demonstrated here i didn't know that one before personally pake's special ability when activated will spot anyone in its range for about seven seconds in different pulses it will also spot the pace the person using it on the minimap 2 as a small punishment for using it and remember that because of her passive if you shoot pake you will be spotted for 5 seconds that's a really strong passive ability rao can hack enemy soldiers if you get hacked you will be spotted for 6 seconds although at the moment this will rarely happen because no one really plays as rao if you get killed whilst you're hacked you will also act as a virus and spot any teammates near you for the enemy team useful to know firing the recoilless m5 rocket launcher does not spot you on the minimap so go boom boom all you like and you'll be fine throwing c5 explosives or grenades also does not make you appear on the minimap same goes for throwing sundance grenades into the air casper's drone is one of the most powerful spotting tools in the game you don't even need to click anything all you have to do is roughly one the center of your screen over a target and they will be spotted for nine seconds 3d marker and minimap spot that is pretty insane when you think about it the software another great tool for spotting enemies not only can it lock on vehicles but you just have to roughly look at an opposing player and it will spot them for about nine seconds if you keep looking at a target they will continuously be spotted whilst you're looking at them also if you spot a vehicle with enemy players in and the players then jump out they will continue to be spotted after exiting the vehicle in the case of the soflam here 10 seconds after the initial spot some vehicles like the nightbird and wildcat have spotter seats when looking at an enemy and clicking you will spot them for about 10 seconds in total making those extra positions very strong from a recon perspective they can also have a pull scan on them too that can detect infantry near above and below although the range of that is quite small it can detect multiple people at once in each of its waves and then finally the proc sensor it was already nerfed but now you throw it down and it lasts approximately 13 seconds sending out pulses that briefly flash up enemies on the minimap for a split second it also has a pretty small range on it too and if you see an enemy one you can interact with it throw it and change it onto your side while it's still alive as far as i know at the moment that's pretty much all of the stuff that can minimap spot you in the game and when you really lay it all out like that and think okay there's 128 players on a maxed all-out warfare server the chances of you being spotted especially if you're around objectives in conquest and breakthrough more so in breakthrough i would say is incredibly high the action and the amount of players in a small area there is huge and the fact that if you fire your gun unsuppressed just once without the pb heavy or type 4 suppressor on it and you'll be on the mini map for five seconds isn't that a bit excessive just one person using a soft lamp or a drone nearby you one boris turret you're probably on the mini-map for a prolonged period of time all of these things add up on top of each other and you end up in a situation that we've been in before with battlefield where you're playing from the mini-map you're not using your eyes and your ears and you're being punished and spotted when you don't even realize it i just feel like the overall design of the spotting mechanic and everything that can spot you needs to be looked at again in terms of volume and duration i would love to just be able to play my infantry game and go on flanks without constantly fearing that i'm on the mini-map it dilutes the infantry gameplay down significantly when the enemy can see where you are most of the time yes we've moved away from the 3d doritos spotting of old where you could just spam queue and spot entire enemy squads but i feel like we're going back there again just in a different way in bf5 at least it told you when you were spotted having that back in 2042 would be a good first step the suppressor thing also that definitely needs to be clarified in the description of the attachments or i just think the attachments aren't working as intended right now that's my two cents anyway do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below hopefully you found this useful and can take all of this knowledge into game with you maybe now you'll have a much better idea of when you're spotted when you're on the mini map and you can make better informed decisions in your gameplay based around that knowledge hopefully it's helped thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you
