nvidia have just released a trailer showcasing some of their graphics features in battlefield 2042 and there are some new snippets of gameplay in here so as you can see the first clip here on discarded we can see a player up on the cargo ship with a shotgun causing a bit of damage discarded again some kind of lever action rifle here too reminds me of the mk2 carbine but that's pretty neat so this game will have ray tracing but only for the ambient occlusion which just means more realistic shadows and here we can see pike using her wall hack ability dice have said that they are nerfing this so expect that to be changed before the game comes out and then there's this clip on renewal this is the map with a big wall in the middle where you've got arid wasteland on one side lush green on the other nice to see a bit of tank gameplay finally we're back to discarded i think this is showing off a bit of that terrain detail three new screenshots here too with a look at some new character skins we've not seen before pretty sure this is kaleidoscope in one of the buildings and lastly renewal again outside by that big solar array thanks for watching
