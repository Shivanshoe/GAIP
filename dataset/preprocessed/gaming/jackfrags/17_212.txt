october 27 2011 that was the first day that you could play battlefield 3 if you lived in the uk that's exactly 10 years ago an entire decade and if you load up bf3 today there's still people playing it and you know what on pc it still holds up the graphics somehow they're still really good yeah some of the gameplay mechanics do feel archaic now the suppression is just ridiculous but the gun play the movement the overall sandbox nature of the game that gritty military feel that it has it's still there and i've personally got so many fond memories from this game as i'm sure many of you watching right now have too and bf3 for a lot of people was their first taste of battlefield maybe they weren't around there for the early days of pc with 1942 vietnam desert combat and perhaps they didn't jump on the bandwagon of bad company one and two a couple years before bf3 though it had the big budget it had the advertisements way more eyes on it than ever before it was going up against modern warfare 3 and it was pitched as a true competitor to call of duty i think the fact that we're still talking about it today and that it still has players and that it's so iconic is a testament to just how good it was and maybe we didn't really know or appreciate it as much at the time and it's so cool that we'll see to the maps from the game remade in battlefield 2042 portal along with guns gadgets and classes it will be really interesting to see how it plays in a modern video game engine october 27th 2011 was also the first day that i uploaded a youtube video it was this video here battlefield 3 multiplayer quality test footage 720p and it's one minute and 58 seconds of the very first time that i loaded bf3 up outside of the alpha and the beta you can see in the scoreboard i'm literally level one and it was some gameplay with a few friends on cog island on ventrilo together experiencing a fresh battlefield game bf3 was said to be the true sequel to battlefield 2 again that we'd all played religiously so there was a lot of expectation for this one and in the video you can't even hear my microphone i wasn't recording it you can hear my friends you can hear the game audio and the quality isn't even that good it's only in 720p i was probably using fraps for recording too which just absolutely killed your frame rate but it was the best thing that we had at the time and i left resampling on the video so it was nice and blurry and the reason that i uploaded this video was because i thought that it would be cool to document me and my mates playing together in a few years time we could look back at the videos and go remember that time on operation firestorm where we were all on the side of the cliff with soft lamps and javelins taking out vehicles left right and center remember the first time we dived off the helipad on dhammavan peak or how about that time that we turned the jets upside down and rode them along the pipes like idiots that's what it was for but then i realized that i could be a bit more creative with this stuff we made a few songs montages a couple of stupid skits here and there that were all filmed in game and it was all a good laugh some of the videos were even shared by the official battlefield facebook page and at the time that was huge and alongside my videos appearing on reddit and other early social media platforms i managed to establish a bit of a subscriber base and it was only a few months later i think it was january 2012 that i was invited to become a partner with machinima and they were a network that worked with youtube and if i partnered up with them it meant that i could run adverts on my videos and make a bit of spare change and then six months after that i quit my job and i took a gamble with youtube decided do it full time see how it goes if it works out great if it doesn't it is what it is ten years later we're still here and i just wanted to say thank you really i don't want to make a big song and dance out of this but even though probably never meet many of you guys i just want you to know that watching my videos and being there for me it's really enabled me to do something that i love and i'll always be grateful for that even though youtube as a platform has changed so much over the last 10 years hopefully my channel is still a place where you can come chill relax sit back watch some fun gameplay with commentary or with friends learn about a new game whatever it might be and if that's good enough for you then i'm happy now to celebrate the channel being here for 10 years i thought it would be cool for a little brand change and some of you may have noticed the logo has changed the profile picture header etc and i've had an artist called tysol put this together i think it's brilliant he's done a lot of my previous artwork on t-shirts prints etc and we're going to make this available for you guys to use for free if you want to use it as desktop background or tablet background apple watch iphone mobile phone whatever you want there's a pack that you can download and it's linked down in the description below a couple of options for you there to choose from so yeah i don't want to drag this out longer than it needs to be just to say thank you 10 years of your support insane you're the best and with that said of course for the rest of the year we've got a ton of stuff to look forward to 2042 i'm gonna be hitting that hard on the channel whether that's video streams whatever it might be new card new warzone map halo infinite forza horizon 5 plenty of others
