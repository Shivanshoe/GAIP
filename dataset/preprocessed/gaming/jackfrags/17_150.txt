halo infinite i've not played it for a few weeks but today we decided to hop back on and exclusively play ranked in a four-star now if you know anything about this game typically the controller players dominate because of how strong the aim assist is but i like to play mouse and keyboard seeing as that feels the most comfortable for me we had a couple of decent matches here though and i ended up being ranked platinum six which i think is okay i don't know if i've got time to go for onyx which is the top rank but maybe we'll have to see it's very competitive though and a difficult game in ranked singers the skill based matchmaking is so aggressive and because of this the matches especially catch the flag or oddball can get quite stressful at times but if you win or pull off a nice streak it does give you that classic rewarding halo feel with that said we're going to start with slayer today and then move on to a very close capture the flag game some nice snipes in here some hectic plays with the battle rifle i hope you guys like this if you do leave a like and a comment below thank you also subscribe if you're new here welcome sit back relax and enjoy the clan guys we're against the clan oh no in the uh outside region oh my god four shots in the back of his head there yay we got killed together two kills they're all just grouped up with this outside bit here i like
