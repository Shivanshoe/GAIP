hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more assassin's creed valhalla today it's a bit of a twist because we are going to be playing using g-force now big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one and we will be continuing where we left off last time so we started playing on the xbox series x but the game has got cloud saves so i can play on this and keep going it's kind of cool so if you don't know what geforce now is it's a way to remote play games so you're essentially streaming playing the game like remote play you know what i mean and there's all sorts of games on here from the epic games launcher ubisoft some select games on steam as well and it's basically nvidia's stream streaming service it's really cool uh it's available on windows mac android chromebook and nvidia shield and basically it means that you can play new games modern games without needing a crazy high spec pc and we'll get into how it works and i'll show you guys what it looks like in a second when we boot the game up um it is free the basic version of it is free you can sign up and just start playing straight away and that will give you one hour play sessions and then it will kick you out and you can just q q again and play for another hour but you don't get rtx features if you do the free one uh it also has a paid subscription which is 4.99 a month and that gives you priority access to the servers and game sessions and six hour long sessions and you also get rtx features like uh ray tracing dlss that kind of thing um all you have to do as well to start playing is download the geforce now app there's a link in the description if you want to check it out for yourself and it'll also be in the chat every 15 minutes or so you don't need to download any games or anything because it's all on their servers just instantly updated all that good stuff everything's in the cloud and one really cool game that's coming to it is cyberpunk so you know it could be an interesting way to play if you don't have a sick pc or anything you could play like a really old laptop or whatever now as i said today we're going to be playing assassin's creed valhalla if you've got any questions about geforce now or about the game ask away in the chat or in the comments i can see you guys thank you so much for coming along and checking this out and we're just really it's really simple just click play there it is and it's going to boot up so this isn't running on my pc this is now connecting to an nvidia pc or an nvidia server it's kind of hard to get your head around but once you get it you get it so it's logging into my ubisoft account here so it sent me a security code so we're just going to whack that in now make sure it's a trusted device as well and it should have all of my cloud saves on and we'll continue where we left off last time i was still in norway first couple hours of the game i really enjoyed it it's it's good fun i like it a lot it's a great time sink hello average gamer hi pete what's up hey michael gruber what's up serial golfer thank you for coming ratchet pedro how are you doing so as far as i know at the moment the maximum they offer is 1080p 60fps streaming i'd like in the future if they did 1440p or 4k that'd be cool but this is it we're in the game now so this isn't i'm not playing this on my pc this is being streamed and i'm playing it with a controller on my pc but it's not running on my pc does that make sense to you guys i think i think you get that right it's pretty easy to understand hey don what's up tacit unknown exe how's it going welcome to the stream guys thank you for coming along so this is it hey hyper beast how you doing um so if we go into the auctions you can see this isn't my pc are we playing at 1080p i think it's all on medium settings i mean we could i reckon we could put it on high so we're gonna we're gonna do that it's running on this the nvidia tesla t10 i don't know what that is but you can see the specs of the system it's running on here we'll apply it okay we got to restart the game that's fine yeah i want to play on high graphics because i know that it can handle it what's up raja from india hello caleb has everyone had a good day it's a bit late for me but i've just really fancied doing this tonight busy busy busy we've got a really busy week as well next couple days are going to be pretty pretty mad it's an enterprise card is that right mr center all right hey craig yeah it's pretty late in the uk it's a titan right okay hey patrick from norway how are you doing uh slackfall thank you for the two that's very kind here so that should have changed the options there have a look yeah so we're on high settings now uh load game i think it was yeah it's that one that's the cloud save all right here we go there's aval looking good i haven't changed my uniform or anything since last time we played how many people are waiting for the ps5 draw lots of them so we're in game he's been streamed crazy absolutely crazy and my current objective was to go to ulrichstad but i noticed up here there was a blip so i thought i'd come over here and check it out and there's a man and a horse old harek give me the strength to give to you what's your what's your deal can you talk to me what is all this my life the fruit of my work all gathered here and now i lack the strength to throw it off this cliff you carried everything up here only to throw it all down the horse did most of it it is the only way i can send my belongings into the next world my children will not bury it with me they say they do not want it but i know they will sell it all once my light burns out will you lend me your strength throw everything over the cliff the farther you throw the better their chance of reaching the next world is that how it works hang on so this guy wants me to throw all of his belongings off the cliff because he he wants them in the next world all right why is everything packed in straw i did not want anything to break this is so weird this is the way it is a ball given to me by halfton the black oh after i put an arrow under king's sig deeb's left arm that's i mean you could help me dude couldn't you this is sparta no i'm not kicking the guy off the edge troubleshooter don't worry i'm not sure that i trust him to be honest uh that contains the scared harpoon head i received from king harold for pulling haftan's frozen body out of the ice they are a generous family is that it that's all your belongings just eat it off the cliff it just seems a bit of a waste you know you missed a few things did i the guards will get the idea thank you for your help you did not have to do this kind and courageous people live the best lives but it can be a difficult path to keep i have tried to live well it is enough that the gods know that even if the name harek gund is forgotten in midgard so what would you do now that this task is done done that was to announce my arrival now i leave this world enjoy your life to ask what wait thank you [Music] what what that was a shock no just yield himself off the cliff how strange [Laughter] anyway i need to get down there i don't suppose i could just jump could i no because then i'll suffer the same fate as that guy yeah these wolves should have been a trailer yeah maybe i mean i feel like i could just i could just jump off can we do it for a laugh jump horse jump oh god is this this is okay this is skyrim now please don't glitch out on me oh no this is what the vikings did the very historically accurate game they were often known to take their horses god oh i'm sorry horse no no no horse it's fine you're okay aren't you uh why does it say follow road there's no road here oh it's parkour that's it i think the horse oh nope i thought the horse was going to be stuck horses not stuck you can do it horse just got to believe in yourself you can't do it anyways right horse have a nice life i guess you'll be all right there won't you yeah god it's fine this is the viking way forgot the um i've been playing uh demon souls today so my controls in my head are all messed up that's it i'll do it the proper way oh man i always like to think about this imagine if video game characters are real people and they have a conscience what's this guy thinking right now about me thinking what is this bloody idiot doing and i could have just took the road couldn't i that's me dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm not gonna get to the bottom of this alive am i there's no way get down there either i think if i jump in the water from this distance florida man i'd be dead i'd be done for ultimately we did have a great time on the mountain with the horse eat that's it go down half claws yeah i don't know how he hangs on really impressive to be honest it would be kind of horrific if you were a video game character trapped in a game yeah there is full damage vladimir yeah there's loads of four damage as i've just aptly demonstrated for you guys all right we made it no big deal i like the snow effects that's cool i might be able to get the horse back now oh what is he's fine about maybe samia okay yeah excuse me lads hey hey calm down calm down here you pants on richard how do i know i'm not in a video game oh man you're just blowing my brain wide open dude so we found a little settlement here so this is england

it's quite a few i mean i like a lot of them there are some that i don't like tell me gorham still lives most of them are quite funny to say he does thank you his day will come ah i hate long speeches only when you're not giving them many of you knew my father half done the black a great man who achieved great things they buried haftan's leg near our temple the crops have never grown tall they buried his arsenal hours and we get nothing but a muddy river i dream of something greater a vast kingdom of warriors in numbers the world has never seen united under one king one rule two the big blood has been spilled fighting one another today we unify and turn our blades outward to conquer new lands and who better to lead us to glory than me i was blooded before the age of 10 and i led the greatest army norway has ever seen but they say a wise king seeks honest counsel so i ask who among you rejects this new arrangement i am not your enemy king harald but i will not be your subject

harold may i speak the floor is yours king stay bjorn my people have held our land since the days when odin himself walked among us my kingdom is humble but we have paid for it in blood our victory over kyoto is proof that we will not lay down without a fight all here have buried friends brothers and sisters sons and daughters and i for one have had my fill of death you look so sad doesn't it seek war look beyond our shores if king harold brings peace then i am happy to bend my knee to him what what in hell's name are you doing father securing a lasting peace our days of fighting are finished you said nothing of this to me not a word and i will not yield a title that should be mined by right then war will continue men will die villages will burn you foolish boy this is our only way towards true peace you will die a thrall you drink addled cow alone and toothless in a bed of straw this was never an option forgive my son he is ruled by his emotions i take no offense depending on and i thank you for your fealty it is natural to fear chains to resist it but all things change in all things and the lessons of ragnarok are clear we will speak again soon harold is an absolute mad lad mad he's off the chain that was an ambush lord did you know of stephen's plans for some days yes i did but it was not at my urging it was his decision alone do you dream of a glorious future ava a warrior like you would be a boon to my clan i dream of a glorious death but not at the cost of betraying my family i wish i understood you better for those i do not understand i do not trust and i cannot stomach a lack of trust you have nothing to fear from me king harald my loyalty lies with my brother sigurd and i bear you no he will then know that if you stay in norway both you and your brother must serve unto me take tomorrow to think on this but let us leave these matters for another time tonight we will eat and drink like gods and wake in a kingdom made new tonight we dine in hell is ezio the second one yeah ezio was the second one the one in italy king harold giving me mad joel balgruff vibes that's the dude from skyrim right harold's colors he's already mocking his territory barking gods he's spraying like a horny pup may be young but he's clever do not underestimate him he came of age very quickly find and speak to sigurd wasn't he literally right next to me now you want to see a god of war easter egg you there what are you doing if you wish to have words come closer maybe there is i know there's a lord of the rings easter egg so where did um where did cigarette go he's just over here he's up the hill you should play skyrim on the ps5 it's skyrim's not even coming out on the ps5 right what do you see he's in there is it surely i mean how many versions of skyrim are there now like 15 or something surely they can't bring it out on on ps5 maybe they will skyrim remastered remastered edition open the door come in keep your voice down where will we live the english will fight back the wash will never end or they will push us into the christian ways quiet all give me a chance to speak so with all this whispering sounds like a demonic summoning sigurd you wanted to talk to me talk to me two days ago we read this land of kirtvan his dogs yet today we do not celebrate today we cower under a cloud of fear but it need not be like this we are not the heel trodden subject yeah i've seen that daniel we are the raven clan our destiny is our own did you know about your father's oath to harold i did not and for that my anger burns hotter than any man's here but i will not let that drive me into despair we cannot stay in norway not under harold's boot not without fuelling more war so we push forward to newer lands the assassin agrees and there make a new home a kingdom of our own the sons of ragnar lothbrok have been in england eight winters already is there any land left for a clan of our size more than enough wife of the four kingdoms of england only one is truly pacified i have no desire to wear harald's leash i like this idea a saga for the ages i agree it will take time and resources to build ourselves a new home but the richest taken from kyoto would suffice no that belongs to my father as a fair compensation in england we must start anew you would start us with nothing in the land we do not know among people who hate us cured with riches would go some way to easing our passage cigarette i bested him it is within my rights to claim his goods our leaving must not be an assault on my father it is a time of renewal for us hmm if we go we'll say we thank him i say we take cut the spoils for our own i abhors that theft but if this is what it takes to sway you to my course i accept sturgeon will prosper by the generosity of his new king cure to his goods belong to us to england then before the day is out pack what you need but no more than that and tighten your lips the last thing we need is the attention of huddle's troops the characters are a bit glitchy in the cut scenes aren't they christopher can you play ps4 games on ps5 you can play like 99 of them how much did you hear enough a new path is revealed and your journey will be challenging will you not join us for my mother's sake i cannot but our threats will cross again before the final day until then farewell farewell yeah i did see the videos of the the xbox series x vaping so weird did you guys see that on social media today i think i saw it on twitter someone was vaping smoke into the bottom of the xbox series x and then it was like all coming through the top and they posted a tweet or someone took that video and made out as if the xbox was on fire or something but it's not it's just people blowing vape smoke into it i mean i've got a series x and i've been using it for about four or five weeks now and it it doesn't get hot it doesn't make any noise so i think it's really unlikely to be true it's just very small i find it flattering you think one will marry you and carry you off to the capitol who would he still fake he would take his pleasure and move on you well i think this is going to take us to england hey vod the wind favors us we should set sail without delay you made quick work of packing well done the dream of new lands is a powerful lure as is the promise of glory but the act of leaving so beloved home there's a sadness to it having doubts no not at all the dies cast then let fate guide our journey are you ready i'm ready let's go i'm ready to england and leave unboxings that chance has passed look fade flies and swifter wings than me king harold's banner oh they're trying to stop us [Music] siegel what is this assembly that seems really glitchy an exit father as graceful as i can for if i cannot be king in the land of my birth i will start a new saga in england nonsense your place is here son at my side there will be other victories soon other glories my choice is mate father do not hope otherwise there's nothing for me here i must go make my name in the world yeah ben roberts this is on g-force now on pc it's whenever the cutscene changes to a new scene it lags a little bit you leave foreign i'm behind but your honor you left me no choice i entered the alvin a prince i left the son of a yard there are always choices sigurd i will not stand between you and yours but i do not accept it no 17 winters ago i opened my door to you haver and now your only thanks is to rob me i should have left you to the wolves dude we're not friends and we never will be sad old elk do not carry his words with you to england he brought this day upon himself i know right time to sail here we go oh my still stress is over you weeping sacks of wool put some muscle into those pools ration your strength dog we have an ocean to cross all right you lazy background see good what's our course the songs of ragnar established in the coast we set sail for them sing a song to lift our hooves to rouse the gods inspire a mighty fart from thor to speed us on our way an ocean lies before us that's so weird on its far side a new kingdom awaits you know england well from your travels i spent the season in their kingdom of mercia a temperate land lush and wild by now the sons of ragnar will have claimed its heart do we mean to join their own they will join ours in time all of england will know panoramic view nice and the glory we brought to that fractured land so to england glory and destiny to england to england well there we go there's the title screen we finally got there after two hours and 45 minutes the mighty fart of thor oh okay go modern day now are we who's this uh leila i think her name is she was in the last two games right origins and i'll to see it's the first time we've gone modern day hey thomas how you doing what's up paul but at least use a glass [Music] where are we in a lecture at the university of cambridge dr sierka told a worried audience that scientists have few answers for them since the mass coronal injection of 2012 the strength of the earth's magnetic field has increased by a factor of 50 000 this has resulted in huge disturbances in radio and satellite communications dangerous bands of radiation around the poles and as we can all see from our window an aurora borealis that never burns away unfortunately we are stumped as to why this is happening and if we cannot find an answer soon it may change the way we live the way we communicate even the way we evolve forever the art is in a really bad state brought you more electrolytes oh new and improved citrus flavor thanks sean here's the cheeky english bloke it's in every assassin's creed game whoa earthquake how do we fix this how are you the key to everything so the earth is ruined and is that either you're a long way from home maybe oh that's kind of sad so if this is england we know that he died in england or maybe it's not england you're the worst thing but it's kind of ruined isn't it look there's the aurora volley out of the schmidt or aurora borealis it's permanently there that's strange love to play around but i have bigger things on my mind oh mint tea is not actually tea bex it's an infusion it's really just dirty minty water i don't care what you call it sean did you buy any of course i did love hey sorry about pulling you out the generator was sputtering that's fine i needed air how was the animus data stream comfortable felt pretty stable after a while good just give me a sec and you can jump back in are we in america okay another satellite came down did you see i did one of abstergos that's good well most of north america just lost its gps service so depends what you mean by good really right even when we win we okay we're all set whenever you're ready you can jump back in right they've got a little base here and the world is ending and i guess they have to use aval's memories to figure out why the world is ending and maybe they can fix it you're going to put this in the fridge sean guess of course in half a minute remember tomatoes sound like me nuclear please enjoy your stay remember all the garbage must be packed out and please water the plants once a day yeah i won't remember that this bloke's really posh i'm not posh hello leila hello leila sean what do you make of the grave out there well it overturns a few hundred years of scholarship about the first europeans to set foot in north america apart from that it's just a bunch of muddy bones isn't it very inside talk about this thing on my neck for a second ah the mood stabilizer yes it's not harmful is it i mean i feel good but i want to make sure there's no side effects there shouldn't be it's only blocking outside signals a passive effect so the staff doesn't you know mess with you sean what happened last year i i had no control over that i tried to resist i understand and your old team maybe they don't but we've seen that sort of thing before still if you want to work with us and get to the bottom of why the world is about to end for the second time in eight years then you wear that thing until we say otherwise william's orders i know it's not a problem it's just a few more weeks yeah just until we figure this out you're right i know you're right it's fine just changing your mood your bloodstream and everything about your personality it's no big deal right should we go back in the animus then i mean this is interesting but i feel like vikings are just cool let's go back to viking times yes someone asked in the chat how do i record ps5 games all right time to go norway to india i've taken about a week by long ship so i'll scrub ahead skip to the end layla you okay crazy sorry can you play the message again we have the transcript if you're looking for something i can i want to hear it okay rebecca i don't mean to be cryptic play it it's just that message led us here to this place to a norse grave in north america so those bones out there are the only lead we have our only chance at fixing this planet before it's too late here it i is i died and now i sleep and in my sleep i dream and in my dreams i see an end to the doom that will grip the earth once again find the wolf kissed find the mad one find me and save us all from another death sounds like that buzzing block doesn't it unsettling that is that pulse in the message are you sure it's just coordinates nothing else nothing i can find okay i'm ready here we go are we back in the vikings tommy they're using a gpu that i've i've never heard of before apparently it's a titan for servers or something you know the monkey we we're going back in viking times now don't worry here we go we made it england that's just green there she is england our new home not a patch on norway but we'll make this land our own soon enough i'm glad to see any land at all and we'll be happy to have my feet on solid ground again we must not rush our all you see here is saxon territory the kingdom of mercia largely unpacified there will be eyes watching us from the trees with bows drawn and trapped set we must be wary randy taking your oars all standing have you spotted something not yet but let us go ahead to clear the path of any dangers then follow our lead when the sun brushes the horizon understood they thought bless you all on your way we will see you soon yes i'm ready for whatever these green thumbs fairy folk have to throw at us sigurd do the sons of ragnar know that we're coming they do not but they will not scoff at our visit of the four kingdoms in england the sons of ragnar have settled only one the rest is ripe for the taking do we mean to join their army no now we will speak with them get the lay of the land and carve this country into as many pieces as we see fit look ahead there is that what passes for a town plain brick in a single room to their timid god that rune is called a root dog the cross upon which god was sacrificed it sits atop a monstery a place of worship that cross killed their christ and now they display it in worship bizarre we carve idols of our gods and make wishes before them like our sacrifices to odin the one-eyed but we do not worship the wolf that kills him that is the difference whatever strangeness we see in these saxons they must think the same of us the hammer now there is a symbol worthy of a god a bolt of lightning would take that cross clean off so this is a stream within a stream someone asked what gpu it was i did show this earlier but just to show again it's running on an nvidia tesla t10 so i'm i'm playing a stream right now it's kind of crazy if you want to try it for yourself link is in the description below g4s now it's free how long sessions are free and then if you want longer sessions and stuff like rtx and dlss it's five dollars a month i think look there what are they doing ritual that would be interesting to test it out awesome doc are the ways of christians really so unfamiliar to you not at all i simply forgot someone has to keep the conversation up it must be priests and worshippers alone in that place we could storm this port with ease sack it without breaking a sweat is there much in the way of treasure there always they shape precious battles and cup jewels to their golfs there will be a fortune there later zack there will be time enough for raiding once we have settled it's a long journey isn't it i thank you very much for the five sat in a jack frank's t-shirt that's super cool man thank you pull up over there the way forward is blocked by a chain spanning the river we must remove it before passing on a chain can we come no well there must be a way to release it somewhere in that camp i will go and i will be right behind you know that you stay here should trouble come our way i want you defending the ship a good idea send out the arrow and keep your sharpest axe at hand huh something like that look at that all right we're off the boat right him when you're gonna play with the scottish boys do you mean as he and char i don't even know if they play games anymore i mean if they're up for plane summit sure yeah probably the new battlefield i reckon whenever that's out are these guys just gonna attack me straight away i should be cautious around here hey it's the vikings then well this is a good introduction to the vikings isn't it so we've just sailed all the way to your lands and uh you're all dead hey come down don't get it away from me oh yeah when i did that assassination in that bush i thought he was gonna drag him in or something you can't drag into the bush chain is huge and poorly anchored it appears i might be able to shoot it [ __ ] shoot the chain it's massive i'll shoot the anchor oh what are you doing here are you telling me you didn't hear all that ruckus downstairs you're a terrible archer now i suppose you're dead so it's all right nice come on that was on thank you for the two be kind to nature i mean they could have helped couldn't they you know what i mean at least one of them i say we go back sigurd give those dogs a good knock around and take whatever treasures they have easy pickings well i did kill them all dude we press on until we reach our goal we cannot afford another surprise now be on your guard it should not be parked gods i'm ravenous i hope they have food and the ale on hand when we arrive you should have sent warren ahead of a cigarette to get something on the spit if have done uber and eva ragnason are lacking food in england then all of us will starve have no worry i can see it now a suckling pig tender and juicy and ale as gold as the treasures that we failed to steal back there a man of simple pleasures aren't you dag and he is worried for my part uh jake thanks for the two just standing in the pool bf1 yeah what definitely the great romans and their empire giants of a forgotten age they held dominion here long ago and their ruins dot the landscape every brick and stone tells a story of conquest and glory and you aren't off the boat i don't know ready to be we will reap why is that that's so weird when it does break by brick and ours will not crumble to dust all things and dog ruins are not a warning they are a testament look there just ahead where the sons of ragnar make their camp at last we find our feet sigurd hold back keeps cutting off the audio good uh he isn't right there is too little movement for an army only tents and a few men does that have rtx no don't think so no let us get a closer look maybe please correct me if i'm wrong i don't think it's got ray tracing it might have some rtx effects like global illumination and lighting or something but i don't think it's got rage racing um i mean i can look in the menu if you like graphics yeah there's nothing i mean that might be an rtx feature reflections maybe i don't know i don't think they explicitly said if it does or doesn't hey sebastian how you doing they're too wrecked and soiled we should proceed on foot as they spot the bones they have a lot of input not at all we all go if they are friends try out for yourself and if they oppose then we fight them all together you don't really notice it in a game like this i think in fps games you notice it a little bit but when you i'm using a control then it can't really feel any input lag i do have a very good internet connection they speak with twisted accents english no doubt dark reborn when you've been speaking english the whole game he's just walking into the wall then yeah i'm pretty sure it's not rtx but i mean looks looks alright still hey they are the mad englishman oh what's this a mess of filthy danes befouling our riverwares you there give us your name i am sacred yar or fornberg and you are men who do not take kindly to dane invaders creeping into our camp you'd best move along pagan spare yourselves a slaughter you threaten those man with a play of force oh we're gonna get a fight i have been eight days at sea without a drop of blood to wet my axe so spare the chatter bucket out and draw your weapon oh let's finish them kill them this is how we do things in norway that's a good old scrap this is dirty tactics have some of that lady you will regret that like making the noises i feel like it gives me more power i ruined anyone else are you wise son [Music] why is the weak spot the leg the achilles heel let's forget them all oh there's a couple more i feel dirty killing english people because i'm in england just a game don't worry ruin emily thank you so much for the fire you enjoy watching this that's cool thanks all of you i want no more surprises right i'll check the longhouse no i don't want to pick him up all right then go to bed now mister you go to bed put you down here you sleep now yes i think this is sleep darling sweet dreams that was a good old scrap wasn't it i enjoyed that all right we're going in the longhouse dice we talked about this are you a bad guy a good guy avoid look at this it's a trap a nice trap might be something inside i will have a look i mean that suggests that i should go over it wait who are you are you with those bricks as well sigurd dag in here those men had prisoners are they green you there untie us let us walk and we will not hurt you quite bold in those bindings i like your spirit we are very agreeable people i promise you need not kill us peace friends we have no need or wish to hurt you speed what are your names it's funny yen lee i'm a merchant not a bandit like those others and this is row one rowan that's right i'm a stable hand that's all i keep horses and well rowan just donated as well thank you brigan sold them off they meant to sell us next as slaves to the nearest bidder but i let their eyes out before i let that happen good and how did you find yourselves here we came to trade with the sons of ragna at hastagnals asking but they were gone when we arrived unbind them you know the sons of ragnar i sold many a mere and stallion to the brothers good men always paid me fair from the look of this camp they've been gone for some time where will you go now what will you do repeat by stocks start anew i have friends and allies across the land to aid me but it won't be easy every town and village needs a stable to keep horses fit and trim i'll find my footing again somewhere what are you thinking that we could use their skills as we get settled yeah they seem right access to trade and someone to turn our mounts would be a boon my thoughts as well any friend of the ragna zones is a friend of mine right doug whatever you think is best sigurd yanley rowan i am siegr of thornberg son of steelbjorn this is avor and dag both of you are free to go but more than welcome to stay if you're willing to pull your weight thank you ross be happy too if only to get back on our feet then let it be done made new friends here what's up gaston great name from strangers into friends into family the others have arrived hey daniel i have a good feeling about this place honored family friends welcome to your new home i like the music music is spot on i think it's by sarah schnuer is that how you pronounce the name she does the music for a couple of the other assassin's creed game she also did the music for modern warfare 2019 and warzone and there were some absolute banging tracks on that soundtrack [Music] we've got a little settlement then hey henry they seem suspicious do they siegfried emergency meeting nothing brings me more joy than the picture of the hand when you call an emergency meeting on among us it's just so well drawn it just conveys a sense of urgency and pressure fine work a long house to rival any i've seen thanks jack now come ranveer has found something i would like you to see avor sigurd i give you england and its four kingdoms mercia east anglia northumbria and wessex from the few plants and maps i discovered here i believe the sons of ragnar have pushed further into mercia here my scouts will soon tell me if i am correct and where are we here and these unnamed cups of trees yeah the cutscenes are a bit slittery the gameplay is fine though what will we call this place i might have an idea vikingland raven storm no vikings ravens we've got the viking coaster i like it viking burger oh it's in you sings once again one day this name will be known throughout all of england a name is only a beginning if we want renown we must build expand agreed we should begin with a forge can you help colonel get working again yeah she did anthem as well daniel aren't you right our neighbors will provide whether they wish to or not scarcely arrived and now we must raid we cannot master this land merely by asking i'll go and speak with gunner now i will go and speak to gunner now should be like that what else have you found sure you can just bloody go to different countries can i gonna call it vikingland but everything is melee stealth damage uh melee melee melee melee damage what did we get something new i don't care about this bag actually it's got a lot of rooms in it isn't it maybe i should care about it rhys jack what's your broadband speeds i have a gigabit fiber connection i had it installed recently high five high five let me tell you about my plans to build viking world we're gonna go to florida i'm gonna buy some land it's gonna be great why are there no viking theme parks in real life by the way is there a problem with that not a bad place ava not at all can i help you with anything sigurd wants your forge up and running as soon as possible for that do we need supplies and riches ah you mean to go a viking then good good how i missed those days ransacking and pill edging blade singing and shill splintering [Laughter] i would ask you to join us but you are the only blacksmith we have we cannot afford your loss oh it's no butter better i forge axes than swing them my place is here not pulling on the war of a river horse though you do remind me i've found a map among the bandit's rubbish marked up with the locations of saxon monk huts yes bandits know as well as we do monasteries are full of riches and loot good spots take the map with you and put into better use than they did frederick it's a good point so jack russell the way the way it works as far as i know is you you can sign up you play for an hour and then it kicks you from that session but then you can just play for another hour straight away but you might have to queue i think but it keeps all your saves so you could start playing this game from the beginning for free or you could start playing cyberpunk for free when it comes out you would just have to do it in one hours unless you get the upgraded version which is um blacksmith okay so we needed supplies to build gunners forge we need stuff don't worry i should gather the crew and go raiding so someone keeps going on in chat about customizing my [ __ ] but i don't know how you do that got some more runes i'm not really interested in doing that yet though nix they tried that in sweden a couple years ago a theme park at least it was a medieval theme park it didn't work as well you know what woodwork which i cannot believe that they've not done yet lord of the rings theme park or a lord of the rings lord of the rings that's a very different theme park lord of the rings theme park like a section in disney or a section in universal studios or something right come on you could have a roller coaster based on lord of the rings you could have a like a virtual reality ride based on lord of the rings you could have food based on lord of the rings you go to the shire go and drink in there what's the pub called that strider goes to is it is it the black horse or something like that vengeance and listen all for the good of our clan it is time to so you can go to new zealand and go to the the actual shire where they filmed everything holly but i'm saying like yeah i wanted here i want a theme park that's what i want well god but nothing more than priests have you seen that new star wars ride that they've got a disney rise of the resistance absolutely insane i can't wait to go on that if i'm ever allowed to travel to america again i think we'll need a vaccine first before that happens the prancing pony that's the one that's it you guys are so clever oh yeah okay the best thing about boats in this game is that you can do this and this is what i do this is what i do i just terrorize orders i just terrorize all the fishermen ready these waters are off limits now mate oh damn vikings only the synchronization come on yeah that's i mean come on get peter jackson involved yeah universal studios or warner brothers or whoever it is a couple billion dollars there you go lord of the rings land cash cow that is they can even have a little section for the hobbits but only the children could can go in that bit so this is our first raid in england i guess no ace there isn't already a lord of the rings section because i've been there i don't think there's a lord of the rings steve park anywhere oh i've gone in photo mode i'm good at this we take a photo of a ball what's he saying to this guy [Music] you need to brush your teeth oh sir [Music] hammer can you do a stealthy rage i suppose you can you just don't press the button right so the devs clearly never went to england i mean it's like viking times england isn't it definitely getting a bit of stutter here i think it's the game though uh sorry dark souls demon souls mode not much is enabled by pressing the two sticks in at once yeah that's right i just accidentally press it because uh i've got stupid potato hands oh [Applause] oh is that all of them game is unrealistic it's raining 24 7 in england uh to be honest for the last two months yeah it's done nothing but rain i mean we do get you know we do get some nice summers usually three or four weeks in summer are we gonna get in there then when did i learn to fight like this um john wick trained me people that is all we you for gunner but if there's more we should claim it and we've got some loot there youtube is broke for you guys well that's no good is it apparently it's working for some people just refresh i guess that was our first raid are there some more people here we can kill there's probably some stuff to lose all set up hey come here a moment help me out here hey you're supposed to help me i do have some weird voice lines get it open no don't carry the things open it there we go give me a hand all right all of youtube is broken right now that's good that's a great timing for me doing a stream and the entirety of youtube breaks i don't even know if you guys can hear this i'm probably just talking to myself into the abyss and void of nothingness and pain right so that raid was quite successful i would say wouldn't you agree jack broke youtube promise it wasn't me youtube is down all over the world right now bjorn oh my goodness i'm gonna keep streaming and just see what happens you know maybe this will end up in the video maybe it won't be fun who knows some people are saying it's working fine there's some fine work from all of you we should we'll just go along with it for now are you certain there aren't a few more gold nuggets squirreled away somewhere i think it's probably based on which country you're in because it looks like some people can get on youtube flying and others can't dag i have no need to count my kids they number too many could be a net split or something like that certain servers have gone down i killed 26 i think ah there were barely a dozen when we arrived i think i'm going the wrong way here aren't i turn around if possible and we could fast travel boat we'll just it's one of those auto boats self-driving boat so it'll find its way back germany here youtube doesn't work back so soon yes and we good news i hope good news i think we have all we need right so we can build him a nice little here where he can do some blacksmithing are you saying that my stream is the only thing currently working in youtube right now gorge bigger and harder than my old forge back in fornburg come visit me anytime for weapons and gear there is no man better than me i will gonna have no doubt building the settlement unique services so can you upgrade my things what have you got for me today oh enhance quality i need stuff for that the only thing i can do is that that's got two rune slots now so i think this is kind of like in god of war isn't it where you upgrade your gear and you get more room i have to go i have to go see you soon may this thing of your deeds and my craftsmanship [Laughter] assassin assassin talk to me python now that you and bassem are settled what will you do we have work to do starting in the cities of england london jorvik winchester all three are infested by members of the same order to which kyoto belonged but their reach extends much further than this now of all the lands on earth i believe england is the most overrun do they can't hear the same turmoil chutney caused in norway not just turmoil they spread a plague of delusion teaching men and women to abandon i see people tweeting about it in exchange for power you have strong feelings about this of course this is the sole purpose of the hidden ones to liberate the body and spirit of man from any unnatural shackles but we have not operated in england for over four centuries since the fall of the roman empire the hidden ones have not had a presence here this absence has given the order of the ancients ample room to grow and thrive our task will not be an easy one but with a bureau basim and i could begin our work if you have the time and spare resources to build one we would be most grateful i will see what i can do hmm he wants some help there's a couple people that i know are tweeting about it youtube rarely goes down so this is really interesting but some people can still see the stream so i think it's a net split i think it's just in certain countries what will you keep in this room my stream's still working for this room is yours it's actually still working you may lay your head hang your axe or be alone with your thoughts do you like it it suits me well but i would be just as happy latching with the raiders on that wharf i need no special treatment this is not special treatment i want you here in the long house close at hand i may be the owl of this clan but you and i lead together as ever so get acquainted with your room and when you're ready meet me at the staples okay so apparently the people that haven't refreshed can still see the stream but don't refresh this is really special guys this is rare for messages and requests i just realized as well the the ui for the boat is still at the bottom of the screen there it's bugged out sandra two what do you want get acquainted with my room i put some posters up that's a nice bed come on come on look at this it's a nice room a bed better than many i've slept in and a good place to recover not much but it is mine raventhorn viking land dude should have called it viking land i got all this food out but no one's here this is historic guys i've never done a youtube stream where youtube has gone down in the middle you should consider yourself looking this is history in the making right here imagine if i was the only i'm not a madden if i was the only stream on youtube that was working the path ahead is bright with glory at its end farewell evor what was that about is bastion leaving us already sigurd means to leave as well is that true we know the sons of ragnar have camped in the north it would do us well to pay them a visit to strengthen our ties to this land is that where basim has gone bazim's motives are his own leave it at that we have more pressing plans i'm writing to let it justice shire to a town called repton ever i expect you to join me when you have finished here i can come now i only need a horse not yet first speak with randy she has more than one task for you here apart from growing this settlement you must seek out alliances as well we cannot pacify england with so few friends then i must join you sigurd for i am a fitter companion on long roads no dag you belong here with raiders and you will act as aver commands ride in safety brother i will follow as soon as i can yes and i will keep our radar sharp do his avor commands is he testing me he may be secret is a wise man i would sooner take orders from a loss a laos oh gave him the sauce there with the eyes didn't they leather chester shire my stable is a bit spared just now would you like me to build your stable for you i've ended the world i don't think i ended the world marty i don't think it's that bad a damn fine stable we have now lord look at it no problem he's around there really it's just 20 20. don't worry guys greetings sure we can just talk this year just choke it didn't happen talk bye are you kidding me there's no back entrance nice we did we did talk about this and you said you'd put the back entrance in but you didn't put the back entrance in and now i've got to go all the way around to the front again to get in you're kidding me i like living in the long house excuse me what what did you say what did you say cut that out sorry mom you just back up now it's broken it's back up it's broken i've already been in here she didn't want to talk to me there you are you're goddamn right you wanted to see me as sigit has so ordered it falls to us to expand our presence in england he wants to forge alliances i am glad with every norse dane and saxon here right we are the outsiders here making friends will help where do we start my scouts come and go daily with interesting news and tidings and i'm beginning to get my bearings in this fractured land thank you i can give you insight into each territory before you commit to a journey there of course once you have gained an ally in a territory return home and speak to me we'll decide your next move then i understand so where do we start you have two options just now join sigurd and let the chestershire to the north it just the sons of ragnar luthbruk or head south to grand the bridgeshire to meet an army of danes led by one guthrum yarl and his second soma i should add our young friend heitham has been conferring with his own contacts in the cities his research could be useful in winning us alliances throughout the cities of england speak with him and see what he needs i want to see the alliance man show me the map we've got to make some friends in england so let us lead a chester shire i'm guessing that that eventually becomes lester or leicestershire we've got london spelled incorrectly we've got essex kent sussex winchester what would that be hamptonshear oxford obviously gloucestershire i'm for hanfordshire is that staffordshire shropshire maybe these all become real places of course don't know what this is up here you got like the northeast here east anglia east anglia is still called east anglia though so they didn't change that one i have changed my mind i'm not changing no no no i want to see the alliance i'm going to go to leicester leicester tell me more about letter chestershire i should like to join secret soon he traveled to a town called repton to meet uber and eva ragnason as i hear it they are on the verge of exiling the current king of mercia with the hope of installing a king of their own a bold endeavor i should be there to help however i can i think you should i'll do it youtube hacked on the news is that true i won't keep them waiting did it get ddosed or something i will send word is quite a distance north on the river trent river trent river trent is actually not far from a big town near where i live you want to come with me to leave a trend no okay sorry just do like an awkward cough a board in it you're the only people i can talk to yeah this is probably the only remaining chat room hello what do you want from me tell me about what you do here whatever you need for your longship my husband and i are happy to help we have quite an eye for these things but right now we're more concerned with you building us a place to do our work get on that soon won't you i must be on my way now goodbye don't be a stranger they always want something don't they it's all me me me me me raiding is the surest way to find treasures and supplies for building up our settlement yeah the game does stutter a lot when you come out of the menus uh i don't know what this is you just put a statue it's cosmetic barracks oh uh colin thank you for the five speaking of your native lad jackie boy what part of the great uk do you come from west midlands colin hey come on you're all let's go guys you're going to be fine youtube will be back you'll be able to watch all your favorite channels momentarily all the way up there wow so if i go all the way up the river sorry what you can't raise the sail here why not we can use the sail here abel yes why does chat work and not the stream zach they're probably hosted on different servers i don't even know if you can hear me zack but that's probably why how will we survive but my cat videos luke there'll be plenty of cat videos other websites are available nice song isn't it [Music] do you have a tail give me a tail is there a sea called among you i know a crazed man about my age called rocco we are taken to calling rocker the rodent for his habit of collecting axes for 20 years he collected access of all make and size he had never seen a day of battle but he swore to thor that he would seduced another man's wife that man called a home gun against the broker walker accepted the home gun and on the agreed upon day he laid out 12 of his axes and ask which of these will i use to slay will it be bone splitter he said my bearded blade inscribed with sather rooms affixed to a handle of english oak or blood fountain he continued my day next which swings through the air on two hands with the speed of an arrow's flight or might it be twin wolf wounder broke her ground now sail out i wanted to i wanted to hear the rest of the story are we no raiding there a military encampment is he not going to tell me the rest of the story are you at the good part yet here we go twin wolf wounder broker growled growing even more bold fierce pair of throwing axes at that moment the man who had challenged roberto brought a large stone down upon his head rocker died instantly and his axes were given away as gifts it's not that funny guys come on good story but i wouldn't have laughed out loud it's interesting how they carried on the story fast travel i think i am going the right way here that is miles away dude i might be quicker going on a horse hey what are you doing what are you doing don't question me i am the master and commander boss there we go there's a horse you better come around here horse so apparently some people are back in the chat welcome back if you've got it working again apparently youtube had a problem i have to pay respects for youtube back in la norway down france down the monkeys are not working it's almost beats we need them to worse let's land better steep affliction oh it's dark it's scary the night is dark and full of terrors one problem i have with this game the lighting the lighting is really weird sometimes at night the characters just look black and white not for you in texas beautiful yeah let's go with the witcher 3 now bitcoin broke the internet don't think we can blame bitcoin now that horse did not want to swim not at all this place is heavily guarded i really go did you say come on you can swim this horse don't kick me off whatever you do see why do you do this dude horses can swim i've seen them swim in documentaries and in movies horses can swim i know this yet in this game i do not swim why it's nottinghamshire just bogeys everywhere i mean this is getting a bit spooky now is this a horror game or assassin's creed what is this [Music] wow right i think we've nearly made it to renton there's lavender everywhere oh my god i need some arrows that's really laggy then survey the area soon who's over there i think that should be here with their acnes are you sigurd strenger igor avor if you keep that up stay in the floors torturing him the place could use some color who are they all spies dressed to look the part oh you can train the horse to swim okay i see ken got feisty pitchfork from this rabid little one was a time when you met and slew your enemy on the field before they could dream of things like sending fires now we shake hands and make deals not my thing not my thing i figured i said the audio twice weeping and breaking a piss hey boy he's an absolute mad lad you're free saxon piggy to run amok mercy and fields i would have let him down easy hmm follow me i'll give you the tour he's crazy the loose cannon what do you call this place i call it the [ __ ] to the mercians it is wrapped on they're mostly the kings are buried below the church imagine they're weeping when we drove them out you planched your knife deep into the heart of this kingdom that is he's got a number of sacks and nobles lined up with their lips puckered ready to kiss our asses the only holdout is king burgred and his war thing why does he walk like that but my brother is deal with them i'd take it that's where we'll find my brother right talkers they are uber and sigurd you might want to dig the wax from your ears uber i love that name that's such a good name i'm not going anywhere bakrat you have the king on his heels because of me because of my men for which you were paid but that price does not change because you have caught a whiff of our hex silver horde you forget i am a sword i ask what i please and i take what i mowed if i wanted to hear you dark [ __ ] i'd gouch out your tongue and shove it up your ass now [ __ ] off geez huggling over silver is a bad look for the son of ragna love broke but worry nothing i have the warriors you need if this is one of them my worries are vanished ever wolf kissed you have come at just the right time upon evil here are hunting a king and when we caught him we mean to crown another our dear thane shellwolf here it's not a role i begged for but it's what mercia needs just now a man to fairly rule both saxons and danes that he's got a good voice do you have what it takes to be king one day i hope as it stands we at least have an understanding the king has refused our offers of peace jail wolf means to change that there'll be a new king for a new england for now burgread is holed up in his fortress at tamworth making a final stand another [ __ ] only furthers out we've held a siege there for weeks to no effect so no more knocking now we battered the gate to splinters if we tape tamworth remove burgred and crown shellwolf come mourning the shire is ours and mercia soon after yes remove i cannot stress that enough bugred is not to be harmed my legitimacy is king hangs on this one simple fact ah you rob all the joy from war saxon not every victory needs to be marked by the slaughter of a king ah but it is much better his request is fair eva and we will honor it there's a lot of cutscenes in this game isn't there chairwolf betrayed his present king maybe tomorrow he betrays us too why trust him how can i answer that with any hope that you'd believe me i only want what is best for the people of mercia and i want what's best for my son in bergeron's mercia where danes and saxons murder one another daily it's not possible this is a good plan brother i'm ready for the coming fight agreed yet remember this whatever you stand to gain here so do we an alliance between my clan and mercy's crown see this man installed on his throne and you will have it i swear the bold sons of ragnar bellow to sound the speared in and the thunder of shields so that fall the arrow storm the battle begins ah you never said this one was a poet he's good at flying isn't he i need to what he does and he needs to piss there's a forward camp just north of tamworth will you go with us lead the way take in the sights of repton if you like we'll be at the docks when you are ready to go always ready mate i'm glad you and your brother have come if only to bring some measure of calm ease yourself dear wolf we all stand to benefit and you'll be remembered for this for years to come for all the wrong reasons i fear there's a lot of cutscenes and they're quite laggy which i'm not a big fan a lively of quite a lot to see here renton it's cool yeah when it loads in new areas as well there's a lot of uh stuttering uh sounds like that frog lady from the mandalorian head i could do that job couldn't i isn't he if you're watching you need a voice actor i'm your guy hi wait a minute all right i just said subscribe to jackprags on youtube and like all his videos also use code jackfrags in the cod store all capital letters yeah well i might stop here guys because i don't know if anyone can even see this if youtube is down you know i got a good hour and a half when people were watching i know that for a fact but then all of a sudden this craziness happens so i may stop now but this was fun i enjoyed this carrying on the story of assassin's creed valhalla a big thanks again to nvidia for sponsoring this one and we were playing this using geforce now so i'm essentially streaming a stream i'm playing the game which is being streamed from one of the nvidia servers and we use an app called geforce now for that which is on my desktop here if i can alt tab if i can just alt tab if we could just alt tab and quit to desktop that's what we'll do so that will save to the cloud so if i wanted to go on a different device using geforce now i could i could do that so here it is if you're interested in checking out for yourself for free there is a link in the description below give it a go see what you think there's a lot of games on here you can play certain games on your steam library apex is on there watchdogs valhalla ghost runner that's cool a
