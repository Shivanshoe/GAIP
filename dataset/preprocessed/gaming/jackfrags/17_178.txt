one thing that i discovered when playing the new warzone map caldera was that you can light these gas canisters that you find and send them up a repel and if someone's at the top there boom you take them out so welcome to caldera a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one they let me get hands on and record some gameplay on the new map yesterday and i thought that would just jump in take a look at some of the highlights that i got and talk about some of the new stuff look at the locations give you guys a bit of a guided tour a caldera is set in the pacific so as you can already tell a very different aesthetic to what we have in vedansk and of course there are planes that you can fly around now these are just in the vanguard battle royale playlist you can find these scattered around airstrips airfields they take off real simple easy to control very effective at strafing people on the ground as well because they get highlighted when you're flying around them and you can land them i'm not sure i'd get my pilot license without landing but we'll take it for now i'm skipping over to the capital here i think this will be one of the biggest hot drops in the game this is towards the south of the island and we've got multiple buildings to fight in here it's nothing like we had in downtown on the previous map where you've got these giant high-rise buildings the biggest building i saw i think was four stories so that's what we're working with of course there's a lot of elevation on the map but it's much more natural elevation and cover like the volcano in the middle for example lots of rocks hills trees mounds that you can hide behind that kind of thing we'll be taking a look at all that in just a second contracts have changed as well there's a couple of new ones too they just look a little bit different and you can also mount up and slide side to side just the same as you can in vanguard this is running on the vanguard engine so some of those mechanics are in place now so you got a bit of freedom of movement instead of just using that point when you mount as a pivot you can now move side to side as well this is the gulag that's changed as well no more prison you just get captured and thrown down a hatch into the mines cast away down there with all the other losers and here's how it looks very simple small layout i think it's the smallest gulag we've ever got and i think the intention here is to just get people in and out as quickly as possible so you've got two big containers central area with a couple of bits of cover in there very basic i feel like that's the intention and then in terms of ground loot well it's all vanguard i didn't see any modern warfare or cold war weapons coming out of boxes or on the floor in both playlists so the standard battle royale and also the vanguard battle rail and it's a bit overwhelming to be honest i mean i've played a bit of vanguard but i've only used a few guns leveling the ones that i thought were going to be decent for warzone so some of these guns i literally have never used before and i'm taking firefighter medium distance for example when the weapon that i've got is an smg build so it's definitely going to take a bit of time to realize okay that's the perfect scenario for that particular ground loop i found this as well cooper carbine and i don't recognize this at all from vanguard so maybe that's one of the in-season weapons and it's just in the crates already and this is the new precision airstrike of course in modern day it was a thunderbolt but in this it looks like a bf 109 or maybe a stucker comes in and just strafes the ground new sound effects new visual effects as well i did get a better look at the planes too further on into the video using dead silence here too apparently it's been nerfed but i haven't seen detailed patch notes yet so i don't know exactly what they've changed with that they've also know if the stun grenades and the heartbeat sensor and there's a couple new warzone specific perks didn't get to play with those unfortunately but it's only another day and then we can test everything when it all goes live and this is an anti-air turret with the planes flying around you've got to have a decent way of being able to take them down and these things make a light work of them i was trying to hit this player here and i just couldn't couldn't do it so i don't know whether there's just no splash damage at all against players or it's just more difficult maybe i just wasn't aiming good enough here but this is another look at the airstrike definitely german plane might be 109 actually do let me know down in the comments below and here we've hopped over to the resort nice area this plenty of detailed interiors on this map ballroom area it's cool some nice pictures here they're probably raven developers i would imagine broken piano drum set i also found this reception area and upstairs is a picture of a cat and who doesn't like cats 10 out of 10 right there this is the cod league statue right outside the resort they have this on the previous map and you can see the pictures of the players up there so i think it's the recent champs or something they put them up there just as a bit of a tribute to those guys and moving towards the center of the map here at the plentiful fields and this is where the elevation really starts to change the outskirts of the map are quite flat and filled with all different kinds of points of interest and in the middle you've got lots of villages residential areas these winding paths that head up towards the volcano in the middle this is a massive bridge that i was standing on here i'm actually at the peak of the map here in the volcano and you've got these weird hexagonal rocks and they might look like something out of star wars but these are real they're called columnar basil and for whatever reason when the lava cools they form these 120 degree angles and you end up with that and you can jump down into there some gorgeous running water underground cabins that you can explore and they've also built some man-made structures inside here you got this bunker area here i'm sure there'll be all sorts of mysteries on this map easter eggs things to solve and discover really cool area this imagine a circle ending here it's all sorts of tunnels entrance ways that you can explore and also big windows that let you see out across the entire map i was pinging over there long long way away that is could be a sniper up on the tower there take him out some world record snipes on the cards perhaps there's a lot of water on this map and you can go into it now you don't die like in the previous map you set a single toe into the water boom dead on this map you can wade out into the water there's no swimming and little trick as well if you crouch in the water you'll temporarily get the cold-blooded perk so people won't be able to see you on thermal scopes and stuff when you're in there another one of these gasoline cans here you saw me earlier light it and send it off the repel another option when you have this you can throw it somewhere shoot it make it explode so you could set a trap if someone was chasing you or you wanted to clear out a room throw it in there a little disappointed here no secret behind the waterfall raven come on you're better than that maybe there's a waterfall with a secret that i just haven't discovered yet but over here at the airport terminal of course there is a new atc air traffic control tower there's a repel going up into the center of it and this was one of the biggest complaints with the first map because there was really only one way up and that made it a camper's dream being up there as you can see from here nice lines of sight all the way around but multiple ways up on this one there's a repel that's about one third of the way up that you can use and you can just go all the way up the stairs so you're not gonna see that level of dominance from atc campers anymore gas canister again this time light it don't shoot it so you can use it as a timed bomb option here that i found in the controls thought was interesting walk speed you can change the percentage of normal walk speed i have to mess around with that and see how that affects stuff like ads the volume of the footsteps that you're making could be worth looking into i'm at this giant arsenal area this is right at the north of the map and i wanted to see if i could half pipe it i think they build ships in these things or submarines not about start there that's the first attempt i'm not gonna get any points for that but third or fourth attempt here i realized you gotta clip something hit the edge get the back end round that's at least 50 points i reckon call of duty pro skater coming soon not very effective though if you want to win the game here back in the capital there's a tram that will take you through the whole thing bit of cover you can spam it unfortunately if you're on the inside and we had to test does it kill you of course it does instantly a bit of myth busting right there and this is a anti-air truck one of your squad mates can drive you can get in the back have a great time this is the perfect place for it as well on the airstrip the amount of planes that you'll see taking off again this will make short work of any plane that you aim at and effectively hit lots of explosions to be sure i mean there's so many interesting varied locations on this map i've barely scratched the surface with this video i played it for a couple hours and i did record every single point of interest i missed out some of the bits in the middle but i got the main pois in and i thought well seeing as the map is out tomorrow anyway i'll just do a live stream then and you guys can get a raw unedited look at it that way this gun is nuts by the way this was in ground loop i also think it's one of the in-season weapons it's an anti-material rifle and it absolutely smacks infantry and planes there's one hit to the head cracks armor and almost kills if you hit him in the chest really gutted that i didn't get a head shot on that one that would have been the intro otherwise in regards to the gun play and what weapons i think will be better as i mentioned it's really overwhelming and these accounts that we had had everything unlocked 10 attachments per gun so it's going to take a couple weeks i think before people actually figure out what they like and what setups feel best on this map because the engagement ranges and the terrain makes it different to the previous map this automaton that i built had no recall whatsoever so there's one that's definitely going to be a popular choice i think the bar as well will be quite strong type 11 lmg ppsh just because the rate of fire will be an insane smg snake shot revolvers as well they're gonna make a comeback watch out for those i just hope that raven are quite on the ball with balance and monitoring to their credit i think over the last few patches of the game they have been and hopefully new anti-cheat launching with this too fingers crossed the game will be cleaner as well quick look at the battle pass 2 i am a cod partner so if any of you guys pick up the battle pass by any blueprints or skins before you do consider using my creator code you just go to support creator and type in jackfrags in capital letters and then anything that you buy after that point i'll get a bit of kickback from that just a nice way to help support me or other creators there are plenty of other people involved in that now too if you do use my code send me a screenshot tweet me a picture and i'll put you in a future video with that said that is all for today here's the victory screen i thought i'd put this at the end just to show you what it looked like do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below i'm really excited to jump into this get into a live match and just learn all the new areas new angles new matters positions all that good stuff well let me know how you feel cheers for watching guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] is you didn't die what the hell
