hi everyone and welcome to episode 6 of crazy things you can do in call of duty war zone I wanted to start this week by showing you some interesting tips and tricks that I've picked up along the way the first one is how to hijack a helicopter if you're sneaky like this and manage to jump into the backseat of a helicopter before it takes off you can actually ride a long wall and enemy pilots it and then all you have to do is shoot the pilot and steal the helicopter for yourself I bet they wouldn't have expected that or even had a clue what happened but try it out for yourself it can be dangerous but if you pull it off you'll win a lot of style points in the process and did you know that if you find a trophy system you can attach this to any of the vehicles in the game jeeps trucks even helicopters and what this does is protect you from any incoming explosive projectiles for a limited time so you can safely move from A to B quickly without the risk of instantly being deleted by an RPG or a c4 pretty cool however it won't protect you from a cluster strike has demonstrated here a bit too much firepower for our little friend to handle perhaps this is cool too and I have to be honest I don't often use the deployable cover I don't even pick it up but it will stop a vehicle which is about to run you over and divert it to the left or the right if you want some real protection though the armored turret is your best friend when vehicles drive into this they just get stopped dead in their tracks it's great if you were to line up a couple on the road like this there's no way a vehicle could get past them unless they were destroyed could be an interesting tactic in solo matches for example if jeeps are trying to run you down all the time and finally before we get into the clips that I found on the cod ozone subreddit and Twitter I'm sure there's been matches that you've played before where you stuck at the bottom of the dam but the gas is moving up to the top so you might just resign yourself to losing as you don't know a way up there on foot well check this out if you use the ladder here climb all the way up and turn left at the top and alongside the rocks and keep going and then you can actually walk all the way up to the top it doesn't look like you can because it's really steep but there game allows you to do it you get up there and then you turned back on yourself run along that wall and climb up the rocks and eventually you'll get there and this gives you a sneaky way to reach the top of the dam if you don't have a helicopter the more you know I suppose and it could save your life in a pinch what could also save your life in a pinch is the right shield and Tartini oh and friend here are using the testudo formation from ancient roman warfare in a video game in 2020 it's the last circle the final zone the gas has started to push in ulti boom here though decides you know what I'm gonna give my friend a firing platform sets of the shield Totti Peaks over the top with a suppressed car 98 unusual pick but here it's really effective so far he's hit three headshot downs and it's just the final player remaining they push forward using that she'll discover he gets the down and then the finish with the m4 that's such an intuitive play and I love that that kind of thing is possible in Ozone over the last few weeks as well I've seen so many clips where players are coming up with ingenious ways of using equipment and weapons in the game to take out enemy targets like this from Paul Sharkey for example and this taught a lot of people that you don't actually need line-of-sight on targets to take them out with the Joker so he knows that there's a couple of players on the roof of the skyscraper here in downtown but can't get an angle on them so what does he do he aims at the center of the tower at the bottom and if you think about it the missile has to go up and then come down so effectively this does the same job as looking at the target you just don't have to expose yourself to danger and I'm sure the enemy players up there will be scratching their heads wondering how was that even possible where crew here though figured out that you don't need the missile to come down for it to do damage so you might take a second to work out what's actually going on here but of course there's a team camping in the ATC he's locking onto a building that is past it so how like surely this isn't gonna work but watch what happens the missile goes up and it intersects with the roof of the ATC and explodes killing the two players that were up there that's G the missile is just as deadly on the way up as it is on the way down Kevin James here improvising in solos if you've played solos you know how sweaty and campy this mode can be usually if there's a building with a second story or an attic someone's going to be camping in there but you know what when Kevin James is around you're not gonna get the best of him he takes the truck puts it in a position where he can jump through the window and attacks the camping player from an unexpected angle that's just brilliant put that one in your PlayBook and from sick movement skill to six knifing skill Vader 66 here it's what I think is the best collateral you're ever gonna see in warzone just look at that absolute filth I don't think they could have lined up any more perfectly than that but they did and Len 289 here showing us what I think is the first ever quad kill on a quad bike so he downs one in the corner reverses downs the second goes to finish off the first third guys reloading takes his chance and then reverses and of course the fourth guy lines up perfectly for the quad kill just absolutely brutal you don't see that very often you want to see some weird stuff though Pollock Thunder here in the Gulag gets killed but just before they die they throw a proximity mine on the ground now usually that proximity mine should disappear but in this state it didn't and the next person in the Gulag runs straight into it and died and Pollock actually got a kill for that how strange but I've never seen anything as strange as this Tiger down on the roof here I don't think that's a custom org that looks like a German Shepherd to me I'm not entirely sure what's happened a bit of a weird bug but maybe a collie straight one day who knows beautiful play from pro noob though I'm guessing he's the only member of the squad left he's won the Gulag spots the team camping on the stadium jumps in the helicopter and then of course goes to town I think that's actually a quicker squad wide than in the clip we featured previously so well played sir an unknown soldier here putting their body on the line to protect their a copter power zombie spots the halo fires this finger you think I was just gonna hit but pay close attention someone in the helicopter jumped out and took the missile in the face which protected the helicopter their teammates bailed out of the helo anyway but that's an honorable sacrifice right there this is just a great clip for him don't drop the softball and it reminds me of that scene in The Dark Knight he's on the back of a quad bike with his mate that is bushy and they're just hunting this truck down with RPGs like it was a campaign mission it looks so good and they finally get the double kill destroyed the vehicle and there's the team like very cinematic next up one of the best prediction RPG shots have seen so far from tight wreck and you watch this the first time and you wonder like what what even happened then because it's so hard to see what this guy was actually aiming at or shooting for in the first place but he's on the side of a halo fires an RPG down to a corner of a road there's nothing there and somehow connects with the vehicle gets a double kill let's watch it again so for two seconds at the top of the screen you can see a TAC rover moving that's all this guy's got to predict where and when that vehicle is going to be and when to shoot the rocket and it just nails it that's a great prediction shot right there and here's one of the best prediction pizza tosses I've ever seen from floppy ragdoll ease up on the downtown roof spots the Jeep on the mini-map blind toss hits the road and boom there's the triple kill I hope he's working for Domino's with skills like those and this is another good throw from mr. JJ this dude gets some serious air time and then get stuck with the semtex I'm sure mr. JJ would say that was completely intentional and I'd agree I so hard here would say the same - I'd imagine at the buy station they've currently got no anti-air capabilities a helicopters bearing down on them but who needs rockets and c4 and you've got loadout crates boom say good night helicopter for a lil and this is ICU sr6 completing what I think is the fastest bounty contract in existence they drop from the plane landing in with their team his teammate in front of him starts the bounty contract the takedown animation is playing how can you get faster than that that's easy money right there and this is a great moment of tranquillity followed by violence in this clip from three two players they've just won their gulags it's getting towards endgame and some kind of unspoken agreement happens there it's gulag round two and three gets the win visible confusion from iron rod said there in the third story of the building trying to get the campus off the top nasty grenade hits them and they back off and they run into a flashbang it's not looking good they dip into the bathroom maybe a moment of respite but no an enemy peeks they take down the armor all of a sudden quad bike out of nowhere you just don't see that very often do you but it is quite funny I have to admit next up a couple of nice cooked grenade kills so Panther here gets it down at the start of the game the rest of the enemies though hunting him down throw a grenade on him he throws it back and it detonates perfectly midair wiping out the rest of the squad and diddler here proving that the Panther isn't the only one with good timing cooks the nade throws it perfectly gets the triple kill on the Jeep Leykis here has obviously watched Tokyo Drift a fair few times because their quad biking is definitely expert level gets one gets the second turns to the right gets the third that's a consummate performance right there and in our penultimate clip Super Rugby here showing everyone how you get your enemy to uninstall the game it's solos 1v1 jumps out the chopper chopper lands on the enemy's head that'll do it and finally cosmic proving just how broken the snake shop revolvers are no you idiot one of us has already died to that today I know but I'm not the stupid one of that [Applause] I'm sure they're gonna be nerfed anytime soon but there we have it guys thank you very much for watching I hope you enjoyed this week's episode a big thanks to anyone that posted clips on the cod Wars and subreddit and on Twitter if you enjoyed this video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe if you want to see more and I'll see you in the next one
