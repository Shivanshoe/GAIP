you can do some really crazy things in call of duty war zone and the first few days are usually when people pull off insane stuff as they're discovering the mechanics of the game like this for example I'm sure you guys might know this already but if you cut your chute when you're parachuting you actually get a few seconds to shoot your gun and I managed to take this guy out in front of me right at the start of the game they hadn't even hit the floor and they've gone straight to the Gulag that must be annoying but I've been looking at the cod war zone reddit today and there are some brilliant clips on there things that you probably haven't seen before and it's a great way to learn about the game and figure out things that you can do so today I've picked a few of the best ones that I found and we're just going to take a look at them there is some mad stuff in here so the first one is from a guy called mere observer and it starts off pretty straightforward right he's on the roof gets a nice and easy kill on a player running away drops down goes for the loot ok nothing special so far well check this out you might hear a vehicle in a second there he is he spotted him the Range Rovers coming over what's going to happen mere observer jumps gets knocked out but his body ends up on the top of the Jeep self revive unbelievable takes him out the car stops and he finishes the job I just love that you can do that in this game that's so cool Klaas key here however not so lucky so he gets himself a loadout drop and you think oh what's gonna happen maybe it'll just fall on his head and kill him I've seen this one before Oh got stuck on the light so he thinks maybe I can reach it from up here shoot it got physics rolled onto him and killed him get in the gulag Koski this is another loadout one from a guy called Andrey so based on what you just saw maybe he's gonna try Meili get it off the roof just kills him don't know why but try not to mail a load out crate sometimes because they will bite back this was just some pure aiming skill from skank hell of a shot there finishes the job on the way down that is ridiculous let's watch this back in slow motion that's a really difficult shot to hit so props to you skank now we all know by now that you can throw stones as a spectator in the gulag but this clip from aunt Asma is on the receiving end of a kill he actually gets killed by a stone from a spectator how mad would you be if that happened to you it doesn't seem fair but here's another clip from the gulag this one's from CJ Leto and I think they take it a step further here so we notices that one of these guys has put a claymore down he goes for it and misses by this time waits for the perfect moment boom that is a devastating way to lose the gulag a spectator throws a rock at a claymore that you put down that was meant for the enemy you've got to be gutted with that one now this next clip convinced me to use the Joker as a secondary in one of my custom load outs in warzone simply because of how absolutely ruined this team gets by do noodle so they've spotted some snipers on a roof and I didn't realize this but the Joker it doesn't have to lock on to anything to fire you can just dumb fire it aim it hold and shoot let's see what happens I got to clear sir oh please please please please please that's a perfectly cut screen right there but that just shows you how powerful this can be that's one way of taking out snipers on rooftops this clip from lucky is great people are figuring out how to use the air strikes and killstreaks at the moment that's just a really clean clinical example of it gets the triple kill and even destroys a helicopter that they were using up there Andre here takes a more tactical approach to the kill streak so he spots them on the roof downs one of them that's the bait gets them all in the same spot and then causing that airstrike so sometimes being a bit more tactical about how you use the kill streak and getting it down first could pay dividends vehicles in this game might be a bit more deadly than you first thought - as booty snorkeler here aptly demonstrates runs over it down easy-peasy you think oh maybe he's gonna jump out nope pancake in the storage what is going on it's absolute carnage you can't run away mate not when booty snorkeler is on the prowl in his blue range is he gonna get this one he backs up the reverse guys the reverse into the storage unit and then he goes and picks up his teammate that is some quality driving right there I'm sure we'll see the booty snorkeler on top gear soon let me tell you though he's lucky that this guy work wasn't in his Lobby because he's basically Batman with a gun that kills people check this out I'm on top of this truck right now and here's some 200 IQ helicopter players from razor oh my god I think you're wiser than its Ilana oh this dude doesn't see me what are the chances of that happening I'm not sure but did you guys know that this could happen cuz I didn't gilded Guardian gets killed by the chopper blades before they've even hit the ground what and Daddy here demonstrates that if you do indeed want to take a helicopter then you best be quick about getting out there as soon as possible all that's going on this is just a crazy and gameplay from rabbit here all hope is lost this guy's got nothing left but let's see what he can do he's in the gas taking damage but there's a truck maybe just maybe there's a bit of Hope left triple pancake have you ever heard of such a thing against all odds that guy has no right to win that game and the other team I'm sure they'll be quite annoyed at what happened there but really well played there from rabid thinking outside the box bit of ingenuity the truck comes in clutch this next clip from Joe hottie is a 10,000 IQ play and I think it demonstrates why war zone is so good because of these awesome sandbox moments that you can have just just watch [Music] kaboom I think that's brilliant switches to the backseat throws out the c4 perfectly detonated gets the triple kill that squad won't be bothering them for a while this is a great car chase clip Odin and Friends hunting down a quad bike on the move misses just chilling out on the top he's having a great time thank you this is what all our lives on this table are oi olives all free shops and for one great car chase - one great bait mate this is a one Triggs chilling out he spots an enemy squad he's got a plan I've seen him gets their attention this guy knows exactly what he's doing runs through the building drops the precision air strike right on the door you guys know what's gonna happen next triple kill it took the bait they pay for it well played tricks now as we're getting to the end of the video I wanted to show you that it's not just kill streaks that are an effective way of dealing with roof campers as sergeant Stiglitz here demonstrates some effective parkour [Music] great use of the flank there but the final clip is from og so I see one solo boy versus an entire squad of roof campers he goes into the melee on the first intelligent and then he eats into the ammo in that mp7 he's done the job pro play right there if that said I hope you enjoyed this guy's let me know what your favorite clip was down in the comments below and if you did like it leave a like maybe share it if you didn't like it dislike it not a problem a big thank you to everyone that posted those clips on the cod warzone reddit subscribe if you want to see more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
