enemies try to jack down this road here he is where's the truck it's a bad strike can i snipe him but wait what maybe oh you get him oh are you stopping about the bike no that's horrible i've never done that in this game before i've never had an opportunity to shoot at a truck whoa welcome back to hell let loose this game has been highly requested recently and in this video i'm part of the sniper team i make tommy is spotting and i'm doing the shooting our goal is to flank the german soldiers and attempt to capture the objective at hugo's farm can we do it though we'll find out our sniping in this game is incredibly powerful and only two people per side can use a sniper rifle like the m1903 springfield here teamwork is key and timing is everything i think you guys will enjoy this one let's take a look at what happened um where did you see this guy it was to the right a bit so maybe not sure i'm gonna go down the road a bit rather than going across the open field i think open field um i see him okay the open field turned out it wasn't an ideal scenario oh medic pro that ragdoll's a bit crazy in this game it's almost like they jolt into t-pose animation and if they're crouched obviously they're ling their legs spring into t-pose don't they they go oh i see enemies thumb yeah i'm going to put an outpost here again i've got one in front of me that's a good firefight that was i think i'm behind the squad here tom yeah well they are taking a a network so we're going to need to work on that everyone's like spread out come down what was he doing there i should be ahead of you but it's fine maybe some people like yeah the left of it oh i think shot oh it's him here i think i've got that one in the front i've got cover now yeah there's a guy you see him son he's dead he's dead he's dead he's dead they're all dead so many dead bodies there what's this smoke about i'm coming up with a bilateral hang on [Applause] okay he was shooting me i think i'm coming up with the binocs right here by the wall jack look where my fingers i get him yeah you've got me going come on your left i think yeah i can hear him oh hello one shot left reloading this is for action oh i mean scg damn it we were deep in it there that was good where from left down the road uh like 250. have a look oh yeah one dead more than one i see another one yeah let's ping him he was oh yeah i see hold on i'm going to stand up and get him dead oh he was so close with that mg42 setting it up ready we need to head towards the a network now coming to you we'll try and get to like this building here left on left oh yeah like there a game then i'm not sure i'm moving ahead to place a garrison i think i've got one coming to you you get down beside that wall tom yeah flank on him maybe no one on the right one down there was someone else prone here but i don't know it could be here somewhere i don't see any movement i don't see anything okay come back to you uh not across the field though let's go this way oh enemy in the field oh yeah yeah one down nice one went right as well yeah he's here he's by the tracks he's on the tractor he's brian on the tractor he's got mg got him oh you guys prone on the tractor oh in front of us christ not just in the jungle this game is so ground they are the jungle there's nothing like this game when it works i'm the tractor again tom dad i think there might be an outpost over here i didn't see one no let's head into these buildings hello very loud reloading we're now entering hugo's farm one thing he didn't want gunshots coming in sounding like it was southwest spot anyone i'm having a look oh here uh by the bushes he's going through the that way you probably have to get him i saw him for a split second then other guy another guy oh he's dead yeah guy here by the tree he's going prone i think i'm not you might not be able to see him yeah i don't have an angle uh yeah there is he's crouched uh he got him i couldn't see because of the exclamation mark another guy damn it that's an outpost they put down i can see it i think damn jack i keep missing miss three shots son yeah they got an outpost there but i mean he's moving tom i think that's outpost yeah there's this that we could get behind him up the hill maybe yeah let's try it move up to up towards this building in front of us and see if we can we're getting close to the objective i've got 14 shots left that's fine that's absolutely fine wait look check check this field right if you can help anyone in front of us are they firing at you i'll come dead ahead got him nice shot get a shotgun which is a pistol i didn't oh md oh my god i've got a bandage all right came down i'm pinned let's see him though i didn't see him at all he was like direct south almost i think oh no buy the oil tanker to the right don't stand up though right next to us there's a white oil tanker and he's just he had that that was a carnival this is mg further left gonna grenade it you go like out and probably get out of there right away hold him back oh i got the other side of the wall here i think we're trying to go back and try and get that outpost that we saw really i don't know how we'll get to it without great wang mg's still there tom we should try and take this guy out you let me know where he is i'll find a gap in the wall and shoot that off if you get to exactly where i am yeah i'll put the ping on him on that mound there just about to see like a tiny bit of flesh again all i can see is the muzzle flash tom i may have got him you stop firing i don't know what do you think oh let's see hello hello it was guys this way as well where we died previously well i don't there's a guy that got him i think you got the mg he must have can't see his barrel or anything over the top now anymore okay good i just find that the muzzle flash just aimed a bit above it it's probably got him yeah he curved it around to hit the mound let's go further south here i think there's gonna be men there's definitely like an enemy outpost down here somewhere right in front of us had a rifle yeah he's at the wall but two guys at all okay i've got one i've got one as well i'm disappointed i'll cover the sound is a lot better in this game now like i could instantly exactly how far he was away and what gun he was using like quite straightforward wall's clear wait let me let me spot are they this section here though they're right but we're in we're now we're in the close range danger zone tell you that now grenadine the big warehouse oh god they're in there all right grenades out oh god they're in there moving in oh god oh god are you behind me yeah i'm well to your left leg running down the bush line i presume there's an entrance there oh i mean dare we try the direct route i think it's fine doesn't it no one will be looking there ah left left left we can get this guy hang on how am i alive is it a tank let me spot let me spot uh that's coming from uphill damn it you bandaging i'm bandaging but i'm not long for this world jack he's found me if he can i don't know where you use that wall i think you know where he killed the two guys i stand up hold on i'm not actually dead now i'm dead oh there's a tank there yeah there's something the tank got me he's gonna shoot behind me and kill me we need uh we need a new route into the place now that was just it's compromise isn't it i think so let's try going okay well if you're alive then yeah i'm but i mean it's pain what are you doing there i'm gonna try and crawl up i've got a little bit of a cover where was that oh god this guy's in the field there's so many here they're running towards our spawner basically okay can hear the tank i'll tell them i see him i see him he just run right across the field there's one like here yeah they've got a smaller oh man oh what the hell's that noise oh oh my god as if i hit that what though oh the tank is still here man there's like people on our spawner now jack i'm trying to hold it down here then there's blood all over my hands pushing up oh it's mom's spaghetti here oh my god it's like an army like a five or six men near what where you spawned yeah where i'm spawning now okay i've made it back to that gap in the wall i mean there's an enemy tank in front of me an extra spawn there's one right next to me i hear him i'm gonna try and get to you and put a new spawn down this one is that's the tank extremely compromised it's literally right next to me dog don't then don't reveal yourself to him yeah i'm not going to [Music] oh i'm dead well that was a great one i mean they are bombing the hell out of this farm now all right we can push him but i'm halfway down on this one so go with him we're going in here i can hear the transport truck coming back jack on the road i'm coming back to you i know if he sees me dismantling he'll get me ready no he won't i've been flip him out got him nice can we take that all right uh nah i leave it right i got i got rid of the nose they're gone i'm sorry my friend yeah we don't have the keys tom there you go okay that's right there is a building at the back of the farm we could take i've just put an outpost down here okay just a bit scared let's get into the back of them plenty of teammates here now i think we're gonna capture this and that shows that even two people two-man sniper team can make a big difference in this game just being a nuisance you know running interference picking people off can really help the team push up sometimes anyways thank you so much for
