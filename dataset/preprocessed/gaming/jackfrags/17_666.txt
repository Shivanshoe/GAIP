hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to a new episode of across the battlefield today we are playing on the brand new map Al Marge encampment and I've gone with these children as my primary weapon here just as I thought you know with this being such a close quarters infantry map it could be a good pick I throw that over there and see what you need launcher - oh my good you see all those guys they're called member what iron is it called the cam pistol or something I push round here I'm gonna die it seems like it's got quite a nice range on it this gun though get rid of these spawn beacons and get on the point but yeah this map it's like so linear the shotgun you know maybe it's it's not a bad fall for it what are you doing there and that was one of the anti-vehicle mines one of the new mines that they've got I want these to push I'm just gonna let them run into my shotgun I told you what the range on this it's not bad in the middle of a real oh there we go prone I've got the chance to get this off yes I do so this thing is an absolute monster the welrod love it so much a bit of a skill cannon really that's what I like I think if you headshot someone within 100 meters like that just like that right on cue right I swear it's not scripted it's a one hit kill devastating look I ruined this sir steps are working out okay so far you killin Aidid there is someone else in here I've not really played this mapping breakthrough before so don't really like get the flow of it or anything four seconds that's all you get and there's Steve Rogers I don't think he saw very well I don't really see many of him around but the trailer wasn't the best and neither was the timing so I'm not surprised we got a flank Iran be a little head shot there I say fire everywhere see that would have been a really nice flank teammates got there first though can I get a rest quartz come on squad leader Hank I believe in you look at him what a hero squad leader Hank please please nice yes you know you want to resume come y'all thank you now is this clear now or what dude down there it's so satisfying guys it's so good when you hit that shot no one hiding here is there I think if we captured this point and then get the next set it turns into conquest assault and you could like push the enemy off the map well this is crazy though I mean it's been it can you don't throw those back I was just hammering a on it to try to throw it back well we've learnt something new there haven't we guys muscle hammer Steve Rogers sliding around everywhere he's got the night vision thing infrared I should say can I get across let's go I don't know if that infrared thing works through smoke does it if it does that's pretty good no nope here open this up can I get an angle hi mate excuse me oh look at this little crack here and jump it up so that little war pen squadmates dead here mm-hmm my regime I'll try nope there's a guy lying prone on the ground in 2020 with an engine forty two guys what year is it please no right I'm not there's no way I will get revenge though on that dude I refuse to be killed by someone prone with an mg42 it didn't happen let's pretend it didn't happen that's better spawn it's fall back a sec excuse me yep there's a bit more water to this level on conquests definitely I'm enjoying this though feel like I'm getting used to the flanks and everything nice shot bit of a head shot there wasn't it fun ITA whirlwind Grinnell close to me nice thank you see if we can get that sniper down Beacon and they're right around that corner aren't there get a quick reload then we'll do a little flank here oh it's pretty good it's pretty good I don't want to say that far though turn around turn around okay we're all right bro hello people just need to pop out of the ground oh they can I save this one though I don't know of course if you put a smoke down if you if you just put us there we go no if we just put it I feel like I should save it it blue team's close to me thank you hit beautiful rez and now it's conquest assault I think that's actually a first isn't it for bf5 who's on his machine gun back there people use those things enemy artillery that's all over this area am I gonna be safe here please whining never strikes twice in the same place was it something so yeah we're fine can I just get a little peek here is that even gonna go through don't think it's even going through that did shoot him in the leg it's not wish damage from here is it come on yes - hi I'm gonna get sniped in the head aren't I it's exactly what's gonna happen there's a dude on the machine gun there with a heart track right I don't want to go that way because not great really is it from my weapons Oh oh yeah that's not that's not great either is that friendly-fire yeah let's go let's go we're spotted right now there's a flare of near should I be using my camp pistol more maybe so you can you just play that so far there's a machine gunner there is on their enemy there push it round here I'm kind of on my own here I want to get over that wall let's go let's go we're in that's what I wanted yes any more bad guys up here come on you can push up now guys you can push up I say that's it keep pushing [Music] should have got that follow-up shot there missed it yeah yeah you just can't throw them very far get rid of it get rid of it is that clear it looks like it oh that would have been a head shot there we go that's what we wanted you know what I didn't even see the warning for that I think it's because I was so close to the war she didn't notice that it was there though please seize this dude is just spamming camp pistols up here you know what when I get some ammo back I'm gonna start doing the same and then we'll say and then we'll say let me over dice let's go ah reload and then we'll push in so many enemies around this corner how did that not blow that need up we got to push in here so this grenades man we need smoke AP mine I couldn't go in there triggered at least should I hold this one I see yeah yes come on boys push in push in get some smokes down get on the point stop waiting to die just get in here no he's so close yet so far right yeah I feel like I'd be putting those medics in danger maybe if I just held on to that we'll skip it we'll skip it STIs bazooka oh that's not a good spawn Oh am I being chased right now let's have a look I'm sorry dude reload reload shut the door run away oh you're an enemy ah suppress 1911 so cool and he got a knife cut after that I can't believe he's not taking any of their flags yet although we're just about to neutralize be careless where are you aside the Walther Alice gainer get in it yes see that's why you hold the revives they do come for you I promise I just might take a little while stick a couple of these in hey right around that corner just thinking of it bounce them off that wall there we need to push that point from a different angle loving I know there was a guy there but I'm just ignoring the fact that he saw me I get in chill here might be some upstairs I did you see a small Bosch a door open though so they could be chasing me right now I'm just going to try and hold this building for my squad I miss that shot miss the money shot can't believe that and they've got control of it again got squad mates downstairs mmm nah there's no way it's not gonna happen well we got plenty of tickets though it's coordinated I'd taking me back kaping be enemies on it somewhere where don't of all the angles really the back hiding somewhere yeah right here dude there as well luckily he didn't see me so I have time to switch weapon they're so sad it's so good so so good right we've just got to get see come on we can do this we can do it what even is see it's an airfield there's a little flame thrower a couple these and I don't know what's going on down there I if there's even enemies down there but whatever it was detonation time on those is so long at times I don't think that would even be a kill with a headshot on that distance yeah can't really go there I'm thinking I'm I need to switch guns but it's really opened up here hasn't it really opened up oh that's gonna get a lot of kills is that enemy right now is friendly right around this corner kind of want it to be away here is there a way to get round up here maybe you know I jump up there and I don't even get round just keeps like pushing you off all the V ones are coming in now please they're racking up kills are they [Music] good see my hammer back there [Music] is this worth a peek let's go oK we've made a bit of progress here we are capturing it and I think we started to push them off the map and that should be the way oh my god that was awesome I've really enjoyed that shoutout to my cousin's best friend's mom thank you for that flushy McCullough I hope we won because of him so to Westie that was amazing that was really good really great round there guys thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed that let me know your thoughts on the news sit down in the comments below as well I know I did the video yesterday and hopefully I showed you everything that was there and is it's a great update I think but it's just a share it's the last anyways with that said I hope you enjoyed this one guys leave a like if you did dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
