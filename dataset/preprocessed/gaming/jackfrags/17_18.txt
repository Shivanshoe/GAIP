don't just love it when the anti-cheat works we're having a little fight here at the airfield and we came across a cheetah and their damage had been nerfed so they actually had enough damage to down me there because i was pretty low but watch this i'm self pressing and the cheetah just can't kill me i revive and down them just felt like a really sweet revenge there but today we're going to be taking a look at a couple of new anti-cheap measures that call of duty have just talked about as well as a new map coming to the game and some big changes to caldera which i think will definitely be welcomed by the community including some areas that were actually on the original map which i know that a lot of people have been missing and feeling a bit nostalgic about lately so we're going to start with these new anti-cheat measures and there's some really interesting stuff in here and i love the fact that call of duty and raven are talking about this stuff because it gives you a peek behind the curtain and everything that goes on in the background and they've released a blog on this it's not very long but there's some explanation and a demonstration of what this new stuff is so we're going to start with this what's up with mitigations why are you doing it so a lot of people will say why don't you just ban cheese as soon as you detect them why are you doing these things like mitigations well we have talked about this in the past and they went into a bit of detail here as to why they think it's necessary the question for team ricochet quickly became how do we keep detected cheats in the game to fully analyze their tactics and strengthen our security while at the same time make their experience less impactful to legitimate players the solution let's do more to get in the way of cheaters cheaters for some reason feel superior using software to win games that have no business winning hitting them with these mitigations transforms those euphoric feelings of being fake best into glorious pangs of annoyance we've seen the clips so it's about gathering data and annoying the cheaters essentially so the first mitigation that they talk about here is damage shield and you've just seen a live example of that when it happened to me and they've said that this has been the fan favorite in the community since they announced it because it registers for both players if you're being shot at and see your health slowly trickle down you know it's likely a cheater on the other end of the battle and that's true that's happened a few times to me where you look at your health going down you're being hit loads and you realize oh it's a cheetah we can go and have a bit of fun here because they can't kill us the cheater in turn wastes ammo and eventually realizes they've been detected but a new thing here that they're talking about is cloaking it's your own personal ghost mode we see fewer clips of this because it's harder for legitimate players to know it's happening if a cheetah is hit with cloaking their shots cause in-game players to vanish including their bullets and sound so if you ever hit in-game and turn to see someone spinning in circles confused they might have been slapped with cloaking that makes for some easy cleanup and we can see an example of this in the clip here the cheetah hits the player and then the player that they hit disappeared i presume that it deletes the hitboxes as well so if there's any kind of aimbot or wall hack they still won't be able to detect where that player is so that's a nice bit of trolling against the cheaters there just make people invisible once they hit them love that and this one disarm i think this is the newest one because i've never heard anything about this before today we're sharing another mitigation technique from our toolbox disarm like the name implies when cheese are detected we simply take their weapons away from them including their fists and you can see in the video here the guy literally loses their gun so they couldn't possibly kill any more players if they can't shoot they can't use throwables they can't use fists they just get completely disarmed so they're just useless in that lobby essentially so that literally disarms the cheetah and hopefully they're killed or they just leave the game in frustration and they said here we have other mitigations that will likely spill the beans on in the future some are active now some are in development beyond its mission to combat unfair play we have a second somewhat secret mission to annoy as many cheaters as we can and they do talk about bans here as well where do you go from mitigations what about bans while mitigations are certainly the most eye-catching element of ricochet entity those processes are in support of the biggest deterrent to cheating bans team ricochet issues bounds daily for several reasons and often in large waves since our previous update we've issued another 180 000 plus bands across war zone and vanguard combined what can i do to help make the experience better individually the first thing you should do is protect your account as we continuously knock out the illicit account market cheaters are looking for fresh ids to sneak back into the game now this is something that i've talked about before make sure you've got to step on because your account is liable to get hacked get stolen and then they will actually sell the unbanned accounts on cheap website so people can use them so watch out for that protect yourselves there secondly but no less important are the in-game reporting tools we've been in this drum a lot but that's because it's critical for our continued success your in-game reports help identify cheating trends and behavior it's important and it helps make the system better keep doing it so this is basically saying if you think someone is cheating actually rage hacking or something make sure you report them but if you're unsure or you're just angry that someone killed you and you spectate them and they're not cheating don't report them now i can provide an additional bit of insight into this because i had a meeting like months ago and i've already talked about this meeting behind the scenes with a few cod devs where they were talking about the future of warzone and the anti-cheat and modern warfare 2 and stuff and they mentioned that your account almost has an accuracy rating on it for reporting cheaters so if you're really accurate with your reports and you report someone and that account gets manually reviewed and they're confirmed to be a cheater then your account will actually have more power in terms of reporting if you're someone who just spams report on anyone that kills you then your accounts can have much less value so all i'm saying is try and be as accurate as possible with your reporting because if you're right and if you've got a good success rate your reports in the future will have more importance in a way so just always think about that okay next onto the really good stuff the new content now season four for warzone starts next wednesday june 22nd and they're releasing a new map i did not see this coming at all i thought with war zone 2 being confirmed to release this year i thought we might get changes to caldera and that was it but we are in fact getting a brand new map called fortunes keep and there's some footage of it on the screen here they released a trailer with some screenshots and info about the new map a lot of people were scared that this was replacing rebirth it isn't it will just be in a rotation kind of thing so i think they're going to start with fortune's keep and then there'll be a point in time when you can play the new map caldera and rebirth fortune's keep is a resurgence map much smaller than caldera i think it's a little bit bigger than rebirth lots of verticality here by the looks of it you've got subterranean points of interest as well bits under the ground towns to fight in cove piratey type areas with a bit of water around so that's fun i wasn't expecting this at all and so next wednesday maybe thursday and friday as well i'll probably be live streaming on the new map and then changes to caldera this is an overview of what the new map will look like so you can see all the rivers have dried up they've removed 50 of the vegetation on the map so you'll be able to get around much better in vehicles now and there won't be so many places to hide when you're crossing those bits of land they've also added over a dozen points of interest on the map so more cover in those big jungly areas where you didn't really have any before new places to fight around they've also replaced ruins which let's face it not many people actually went there with storage town so you'll remember that area from verdansk it was a great area in plunder to level up your weapons even just to drop out in a normal round of br and have an early game fight score some kills tidy tdm area that was so that's going to be there instead so yeah i suppose that caldera is getting a bit of a remaster there's going to be new scaffolding in areas like the capital so you can get onto the ruse easier they're adding these mercenary vaults as well i don't know what they are and they are teasing some kind of easter egg on it too they'll also be an armored suv added in season and this is a brand new vehicle that you can use to explore the map it includes a dedicated rooftop turret seat and room for operators to use their own loadout weapons making this quite a powerful vehicle it's got a boost on it as well so if you want a bit of instant acceleration you need to get quickly from a to b you'll be able to do that emp grenades will be new here too and these will be able to disable vehicles and disrupt enemy players so it's a non-lethal grenade that will explode in a short-lived area of effect and if one of these hits you then you'll be stripped of your hood information and vehicles will momentarily power down some of the bits and bobs there too there's going to be four new weapons an smg lmg a push dagger and a vargo s portable redeploy balloons which is cool and if you look very closely at the image that they released here rebirth of the dead so it appears that zombie mode is coming back to rebirth at some point i'm down for that zombie mode was awesome i don't know what they'll do with it and if they do i hope that they do more of the original mw version rather than the one that they had last halloween which just wasn't as good and that's also pretty exciting stuff coming to warzone i haven't played it for a couple weeks i have to be honest because i've just been focusing on new stuff modern warfare 2 all the announcements the bf 2042 season lots of indie games i've been checking out but next week for sure i'll be hopping back on getting stuck in and having a laugh with it and that's all guys thank you for watching i hope you all have a fantastic weekend look after yourselves look after each other if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye [Music] you
