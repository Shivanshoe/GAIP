there's a window above me here i believe so yeah i'm gonna try somewhere cooked one made climber wait for it to blow oh baby there it is i only shot one on uh radar go over here though oh boy he's got friends son he's got the trophy i'm coming down i'm missing uh i'm gonna push blank and low down again oh my oh i got hit from uphill thank you there's a one more guy down below oh you have any place contract initiative yes i don't think he meant it [Laughter] i'm going to say awesome [Music] hi guys hope you're all doing well today we are back on warzone using the most overpowered loader i think has ever been in the game so it took a couple weeks off as there was a nasty bug in the game with an invisible skin and a horribly broken akimbo shotgun that you could use but those two things have been fixed now although there are some new invisible skins but only if you play the normal battle royale mode so yesterday myself and the ceo stone mountain played some vanguard duos and we had some absolutely smashing matches i do have about 200 ping because i'm playing on west coast but i tried to just ignore that and get on with it and the match that you're about to watch was my best so far on caldera just in terms of the tactics movement gun fights and we were using the mp40 bren combo now these guns have been marked by the developers as being a bit too good versus the rest of the options so they will be nerfed in an upcoming patch but at the moment i don't see if you were being competitive why you would use anything else but if you want to see the builds that i had they are on the screen now you could switch out the incendiary rounds for the length and on the brand i just haven't unlocked them yet so here we go i hope you guys like this if you do leave a like and a comment below and also cheers to these legends using my code jack frags and caps in the cod store with that said let's get into the game sit back relax and enjoy gotta break out a little here i guess oh uphill was that the plane oh army ah yes back in the truck maybe they come our way prime with the brand oh i love that i love that oh he just got a rez off too oh there's his teammate fry him he's cracked oh goodbye get out of the game he pulled this shoot again what is he doing i don't know why yeah he was so high uh we're close couple crates in here getting ghosts no money cool cool yeah we're getting our loadouts pretty consistently here though this is nice i just i don't know i don't like dropping peak and getting too crazy in uh some of those situations i like to take a nice steady early game nice legendary stroll through calgary exactly at least for the early then you know mid we get a little more spicy once we get our loadouts get our guns done here we need there we go duo down at the uh station here let's go after him we'll try and swoop up to the high ground on their right they're down at the buy station low in here i've got herself did you kill him i got the other yeah yeah that's it we're clear good job because they think they are popping that adventure we're the ones that do that stone exactly i definitely didn't stun myself in the middle of that fight definitely didn't do that didn't happen didn't happen didn't see the cliff didn't happen it's not real nah uh boom i'm gonna get an advanced uav up ourselves uav overhead i'll show them how it's done let's just truck back up here oh it's just a solo though well let's just kill him anyways on the buy he's jumping down on the road right ahead of us [Applause] i think we go for this duo on the coast here okay maybe if we get another uav strafe dang it we didn't i'm going i've got one you got one fly over there all right we'll cut them off up here hopefully this slow-ass hill doesn't slow us down now they don't know that we know nope where they are but they're just standing still stone i would say hop here and start approaching and then i'll just decoy to the right get a split angle on them uav is out of fuel returning for resupply location i can't quite see them okay they're looking at you yeah yeah yeah knocked one of them hold on give me one second knock the other let's go oh my god clean them up are you soft stunned grenade he's gone down his son okay oh this is good this is just some quality gaming right here i'm gonna just refill the uh stuff bounty up here he just jumped he hit himself off i think i say counter ye parachute high on him fly [Applause] daddy wasn't him i've got two underneath me stan i'm here shoot that was him and i freaking played it again jack i countered the advanced uav oh i love it oh my god dude he got fried another there another same squat same spot and running he's running in the tent behind relocating what the there's a truck i think that's a different truck got the finish on that guy still one on you oh my goodness dude yes this is the game stone this is the game jeez dude this is insanity he got his res off there and he's running oh find me whoa [Applause] i'm good now okay no visual on where it came from it felt like it was direct south there's a precision here okay i'll grab that [Applause] we're not in zone they might try and hit the buy station here you know what i'm going to try and pop a ue for us here okay i'll try and cover oh you see this [Music] hunt down down other one might have ghosts maybe yeah yeah yeah no eyes we're at a zone though could be anywhere oh at the truck buddy not today not the play stay and fight okay now this is not so great we're gonna be low ground we got one guy coming off high ground you see him on our left rotating no i just saw the uav straight there and there's two in the building up ahead of us i think it was this one okay truck here maybe hold off oh we could okay we could wait it out i do see him now i do see him moving to the right he didn't see us you start shooting good spot nice job right side that's [Applause] you want to push it out or we can play zone and hold it i think play zone plays on drop inbound assist limb on that left guy be careful let's clear these houses you think they're in here i thought it was one it might have been a buy station house okay i didn't mark it fast enough what the hell bazooka behind bazooka at the tent there no visuals i think we hold these guys got flesh tags huge damage on him no knock i should be able to hold him on the right here though he might plate though yeah he's running there more tags we gotta go we gotta go moving i'm gonna push the house what's he doing that bazooka though stun check nothing house is clear i'm looking for that other guy yeah looking looking he's gonna have to come all the way up to blue or he might go all the way up to this is in on blue there so he could get behind the rock there [Applause] we have control of a buy station though so i feel like we just hold this we have those other guys shooting behind us too though right yeah they were direct east i got a precision the hold yeah i've got one as well just in case again relocating the safe side over here oh my gosh okay let's do that i'm gonna strike it yeah yes it's gonna be close i'm gonna move up a little bit here there's a little [Applause] okay i'm going to precision a little ahead of where they are i was too i was too close i didn't mean to put it that close [Music] yeah a couple armor tags [Applause] we're gonna get held though [Applause] i think it's okay i think it's okay we play the slow here try and hold these guys out first it's just one i think he's out on target nice okay a couple teams
