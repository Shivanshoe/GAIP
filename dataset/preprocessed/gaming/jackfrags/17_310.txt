i am an idiot you guys already knew that but i just wanted to reaffirm that with today's solo gameplay using a milano and i make a treacherous mistake towards the end of the game but it's a really good match so i wanted to show you guys now the milano i can't believe i'm actually using this gun as a primary weapon in my loadout but it got a buff in the latest update and jay god did a great video on this breaking it all down 520 millisecond ttk six shot to kill to the chest you can use it as an smg and you can use it at longer ranges which i'm going to be doing today so do you want to down someone almost instantly milano's got you back do you want to shoot matt the sky milano's got you back you want to shoot them through a fence alarm just got you back do you want to transform it into a rocket launcher so you can shoot helicopters down milan has got no it can't it doesn't do that but it'd be pretty cool if it did right so this is the build that i went with i'm using it as a sniper support with the swiss or the swiss looking good still and it performed uh all ranges for me in this match i did put a red dot on it you can use it with the 3x if you want you can also switch out the suppressor for the normal suppressor tube if that's your thing but that's how i had it built today i liked it was feeling good this was just a really interesting game though where the circle ended up at summit good fun and i had to use the cable cars to get around no cheaters either today which was great yay i think you guys are gonna really like this if you do hit that like button below thank you and as always thanks to all these lovely ladies and gents for using my code in the cod store i've now ordered the seventh golden yacht that'll be on the way soon and if you do use my code tweet me a pic like these and i'll put you in a bid like this with that said i don't know if i'll ever be able to live this down but it happened let's get it i got this one no one else here no there is someone goodbye how about i give you the finger and you give me my phone call you know what we're doing here you can't even see that he's watching the kill cam i'm so stupid what's the point of these satellites really do anything do they they just put like put them in the map and they just got crazy around them i thought they'd be a bit more fun than that but i think it's just a bit narrative maybe [Applause] oh my god wow i totally with those first few shots there i should have been dead i don't know how i got away with that one nobody around nope [Applause] that is really difficult to say are you just holding an angle still you actually are okay oh fine just sit there and take it that was weird i like this bridge it makes me feel safe is that a frog did you hear that my god this frogs i'm getting out of it i don't need to get my second loadout but i kind of want the swiss and i've got high alert as well i prefer ghosts for solos [Applause] oh mate this milano come on come on i know it's mounted up there but you just get a couple headshots and then it's gg okay i'm on that swiss my ghost on get my milano back lovely ow no that was a nice shot looking about sulfurs are they pushing me oh they're up on the array no screw that guy oh that was close i love the baby mono is that the array guy that was close i think [Applause] just gotta get those headshots man you beat anything with this if you get the hedgehog very strong see where we're going 4x4 here what are you doing what they're right there no well they just did not the whole time damn it is someone else shooting at me i was really confused then were they just sat in that jeep the whole time [Applause] let me see if i can go up and around and get a flank on here just like hide in the bush maybe here he is contact i had no idea that flanked i'm still looking down there i'm kind of torn here do i stay up the hill or do i go in the village i feel like the village would be a bit all right there's no way they saw me then right beautiful get silenced as well thank you take some stocking right on the edge so should be all right there's a quad bike here and there's no longer a man i'm just gonna drive backwards from now on i think it's um there's a sniper over there i think his beds drive backwards okay driving backwards sucks you got really slow stop shooting at me can i run you over oh i'm listening just gonna nail those headshots man even close range you know it's got a little rpm but still beats a lot of the guns if you get the headshots i need to get up to the top so i'm going to use the lift there's no one in there yeah okay we're in 13 people left it's like i'm back on the disney skyliner but you don't go and watch the fireworks at the end of the day you just end up being killed by the gas what's that bike doing there i don't trust that that was fun i enjoyed that i don't really use those i like the sound they make although it's a bit ominous 4x4 out there we've got gas inbound safe zone relocated no one's coming up oh maybe that was a bad idea dropping some airflow's coming i just got out i'm gonna wait and see if they get back in bad time in there from rose [Applause] that trophy on it as well oh come on what is this milano what is [Applause] that [Applause] i think we're looking good for now why is that truck doing they're trying to mate with the hillside or something yeah oh you're gonna fall in no you're going back relocating oh they've gone down okay should be a guy right here that must be above all below i don't really want to challenge that though i just want to keep as quiet as i can no one's shooting at that truck either oh man i gotta go across again i feel like i can play a single-player game here okay emergent narrative here in the gameplay there's a guy there oh my god i missed the roof sorry i'll stay here don't think that guy heard me [Applause] okay two others left trucks down there oh he's firing then we'll slow you down man okay what surely they're down there can i not just jump oh oh my god i missed it is last time not here he was shooting someone there's no one here okay i'm dead i heard him firing someone i know he's up here looking to put an airstrike down i don't see him no i thought the guy in the truck was shooting at someone oh man i thought they were both down there he was shooting maybe he was just annoyed or something shooting in the air did i miss the jumper oh man oh they just stood there that's that's the easiest win they'll ever get oh we've still got 12 kills that milano is dirty though man try that build out i'll put it at the start cool anyways right never mind you wouldn't be losing i'll turn that on the chin thanks for watching bye you
