this solo match of warzone was hilarious it was the second game of solos that i've played on the new map recorded this about half an hour ago my mic didn't record but i thought it was such a funny game that i just wanted to do some commentary over the top so all sorts happen it's great dropped at military base and i was gonna go for a scab there but so many people i backed out got myself a gun and i did it ppsh first kill is on the board and i'm feeling a bit spicy here right i know i've got that daddy if i get a kill it's gonna reset there's a ton of people here there's another daddy there as well keep that in mind for later heard that guy running again i was tempted there to do the execution i really was but second thoughts you know that many people around probably not a good idea and i'd end up getting killed by someone while on mid animation snag the second dead silence picked up a heartbeat sensor these guys are having a fight go for the guy chasing first because they're likely to have more health than the person that they're chasing if that makes sense so go for the more difficult kill first and then we can deal with this other guy in a second as we run inside the building daddy keeps resetting as well so i'm just going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing and here we go over here with the shotgun now i don't know what happens here look at the mini-map didn't really hear them and they just disappear could have disconnected from the game maybe could have just ran away and as i ran around the back of the tent they were perfectly at the front of the tent but i don't think it was that guy i think was actually someone else who disconnected i've got the kill again someone in this building here i'm gonna go in i'm still feeling it so yeah try i'll try something a bit fancy here try a couple of tricks come down the slide smash the window eventually i thought okay right so they're going to be thinking that i'm going to come through the window open the door and i just didn't see them on the stairs because my gun perfectly covered them up and there's a street sweeper absolutely chunk nothing i could go through and just maybe i was a bit too aggressive there but i have a laugh early game like that just charging around [Applause] so i was a bit surprised that like what what am i supposed to do luckily opponent wasn't great land back in easy way to regain solos get yourself a scab you can normally be pretty incognito with that went around looting up a bit found myself a pharah attack rover comes bursting in out of nowhere and i thought okay well they're just gonna switch to the truck aren't they they didn't they were getting shot by someone from swimming pool that's a pretty easy thread for me there get the satchel thank you very much i appreciate that one and that's the guy that we're shooting at him from the swimming pool i was trying to mount there just couldn't get the angle i thought i'll go for a beam why not he just keeps running unfortunately this far hasn't got 30 rounds in the mag so we'll fall back they push right there i thought okay they're going to get in the truck i'll get in the back but they didn't they just kept running past just completely oblivious all right well that's i'll take it why not free kill easy peasy and thus begins the adventures of the american big chunks as he drives around the dansk looking for prey and this little lad here in the tack you know rover i was trying to do here you know just scare him maybe bash him out there i was just waiting for them to jump out but those tack rovers are a lot quicker than the trucks are so i gave up on that went to airport needed a bit more loot waiting for my loadout getting sniped oh that one hurt going through a couple of plates there back in the trunks why not i thought i could fit through there nope too trunk lockdown has taken its toll on me and i've put some weight on god jumping up and down above me as well there i don't know what they were doing and i spotted a dude here behind this pillar and they were very unresponsive to this so no that's obviously a very inexperienced player but you've got to start somewhere you have to start somewhere this dude made a cat and mouse i wasn't sure if this guy was kind of on the ball or if he had c4 or what and i was just playing with him a bit you know trying to feel him out didn't really shoot at me at all and at this point i was pretty confident that they didn't have any c4 started shooting at me a bit there and that's my chance to jump out get to the gap i've got stopping power in easy beams didn't nearly kill me now look at the name darkweed 69 in the clan source remember that name it's a dank name i have to be honest with you guys but just remember a bit later in the game here lots of the server died out i just wanted to be a train i've not been to this part of the map before i'd like to explore those mines up there this dude just landed in get squished easy peasy and they've been shot at from a sniper down here at the by and unfortunately for them i got strela yes so i'm running straight on fire in this game i'm not gonna miss that one i was gonna go for the claps you know the spray but they just accepted their fate there i think i'm looking for some right one place wrong time with australia heading back up to the mines here because i still wanted to check them out there's a little lad here he tried to get away from me up the stairs i just missed jump out they get the c4 listen oh no i think he's really upset really upset it's okay mate don't worry we'll get him next time mission failed we're checking out the mines area here pretty cool got a little ladder you can climb up this would be quite a good sniper position you can see onto the roof airport there too you might actually be able to see into the atc panel there as well that's neat but there's some rumors that this area is going to open up a bit and i was sniffing around seeing if i could find any secrets or easter eggs or fuse boxes on the wall there's nothing here it's just a few intricate mine buildings hop to uav getting towards the end game now to get snapped back notice there's a dude here on the left and the car another one parachuted in i thought can i time it oh they moved out of the way but they went downhill for some reason and the big chunks is hungry for food solos is so fun man they really are like some people just don't like them i understand a lot of people reckon that they're too can't be but i kind of like him this guy was up in the tower i bought myself an airstrike i don't have a sniper i'm just strela farah i wasn't sure if this was going to hit right but trying to find which level they were on i just guess they're on the top level target marked noises have they got time to jump are they fk eating a sandwich maybe i don't know but that's another kill on the board number 15 right there gonna get myself just trying to memorize where people are only six of the people in the game this shot i don't know how this missed look at this it looks like it goes through it doesn't it it actually looks like it goes through it maybe i was a bit too far in front it's not really much travel time at all on the strela rockets but there it is zone's about to go and i've got to move refill on my rockets just in case i need them we're back in the chungus now i wanted to go to the north side here because i know there's a a really nice bit of cover that you can get in like a dip over here i thought well that's probably my best player i know there's people at fire station but there's a dude up here in that very jeep that i just missed hits me with a rocket missile locking they've got me pinned down here i thought well my only chance really sensex he throws the centex at me though and i've got no choice but to push maybe i could have air strike but would have been risky now pay attention the guy that killed me right i wanted to spectate for a bit there is the guy that was going around in the jeep and they actually moved to this area here where i wanted to be it's a nice bit of cover here and the last guy is in the house the dude kills me has got an amax and a sigma fires a rocket and gets a tag but the guy in the house starts peppering the jeep and he doesn't realize it's gonna blow it just gets in and explodes i love it it's great soul is great for a man can be scary yeah can be a bit campy but if you play it and just have a bit of a laugh with it like it's a meme you know really fun i think it makes for good content as well but here's the winner right here barrow guess who it was you guys know it it's sawstarkweed69 revenge anyway guys i hope you enjoyed that if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike limited edition post is still
