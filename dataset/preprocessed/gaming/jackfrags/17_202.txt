hi everyone and welcome to call of duty vanguard multiplayer so i haven't played this in multiplayer since launch tried zombies played the campaign i did play a bit of the beta and before that there was a couple rounds on multiplayer in a capture event and champion hill so i've played the game before but since the beta apparently a lot of stuff has changed and there's obviously like loads of maps in the game now so we're going to be playing tonight a few hours thank you for coming along if you're watching this live give it a thumbs up if you're watching this as a video hopefully we got some decent games in also i am a cod partner big thanks to activision for sponsoring this one and if you guys pick anything up in the card store do consider using my creator code jack frags all in caps so then i have made a build i suppose well a few different builds i think i'm level seven just from playing zombies and i jumped into a couple of multiplayer games to get my settings right graphics all that stuff finally the stg and the mp40 are the meta weapons i don't think anyone expected anything different from that but i put together an stg build and i've got this to level 52 because i used it a bit in warzone because it's been in warzone for a few weeks i don't know if this is a decent build i think it's all right i was looking at all the stats it's kind of cool actually because you can get detailed information on how the attachments change everything it's really in depth but there's now 10 options as well so it can be a bit confusing i suppose especially if you're new to the game which everyone is and this is going to have huge implications on warzone 10 attachment weapons in warzone i mean who knows how that's going to go down like i feel like the vanguard weapons have the potential to be really good got a couple of blueprints as well i think that's the mp40 looks like an absolutely chalked mp40 doesn't it but yeah we're just gonna be playing some multiplayer tonight gonna be pretty chill [Music] you guys wanna discuss anything in the chat or the comments let me know video game stuff cod stuff real life whatever it is it's gonna be pretty chill what's up muhammad handy andy drew daily cliche dead meat cipher thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you hey gabby nissan so without further ado let's jump into a match here i quite like patrol seems like there's a bit more space on that game mode so we'll start with that matt i hope you dub fest 2021 lil goosh what microphone do i have sm7b ahmed elden ring looks sick af ahmad i can tell you that i've been playing elden ring i can't tell you what i think about it or show you anything yet but i can say that i've been playing it and there'll be videos on it soon there's a lot of hype for that game hey rabbids baxter what's up killer andy cogs thank you for becoming a member got those christmas vibes going bit early for that mr unknown bit early for that maybe end of november that's house okay i've not played this map how many maps were there in the beta four dookie thank you for becoming a member hopefully my sense is okay i did uh tweak the settings so i've got my fps in the top yeah 250. it's going to be forgot to put my xp tokens on guys can't believe i forgot that i've got a load of xp tokens for weapon xp just normal xp i need to put them on we might try zombies in a bit van gaan shoot house yeah i've read online on twitter that this is the map for leveling up guns not sure about this uh scope that i've got i'm gonna change that i feel like that's more of a mid-range scope filter that looks like a small scope yeah i recognize that one control zone hey bird no it's not merry christmas everybody timmy it's not time for that buddy [Music] it's only just november are you on that doritos grind unfortunately not you know what i find really weird you know um just like every call of duty right they give away xp i think it's weapon xp and just normal xp on packets of doritos and mountain dew but they put their clothes on the outside of the packet so what people are doing is they're just going into the store and just taking a load of pictures of all the different codes going home and activating them and then the people that actually buy the packet of doritos or mountain dew don't get anything because the code's already been used like surely the code should be inside the packet right so you need to buy it [Music] i just think that's hilarious [Music] sub 7 you're turning 40 this month well happy birthday man i'm glad that you made it this far you know congrats there's still quite a bit of smoke isn't there i think that was one of my major complaints with the game at beta there's just so much smoke when you fire the guns what is going on yeah maybe we can max rank the stg as well because i feel like the stg is going to be full better in warzone is this stg just doing lower damage than it should or something maybe i've just built it completely wrong feels like uh potato cannon right now smg might be better for this map actually just because of the size of it uh wyatt thank you the two we can't wait for thanksgiving is over thanksgiving is november isn't it in the us they have the patrol zone they have the patron oh apparently i just killed someone then i just felt like i was cheesing i just found one bullet and got someone through the wall did you ditch the subsonic rounds is that what it is i mean i'll take your guys some sonic bullet velocity was that actually affecting my damage um that's not affecting my damage though all my damage range fmj armor piercing maybe if we go with that instead try that yeah thanksgiving's like 20 is it 25th of november that guy is cracked out is mine i mean it didn't look like that on my pov i died a lot faster than that maybe hey matt just me getting on the phone oh biggie okay so we've got the different rounds in now oh yeah that definitely felt like it hit a bit harder then but that guy may have just been low hp i'm gonna have to get cracked out of my brain guys i'm gonna have to take it back 20 years when i used to just play cod 4 all the time and channel that energy pretend that it's counter-strike don't want to play too good though because then i'm just going to get murdered by sbmm what gun is this can i just camp here forever what is this a spawn what is this [Applause] flamethrower this is a juggernaut isn't it [Music] oh no you can't slide cancel when you're this dude ah around here what's this like rock music that's playing what else what's going on there well that was fun i enjoyed that oh this is a little bit you can jump up there i'm sorry we've got a new member there though miss uh michael demelo thank you for becoming a member appreciate that buddy oh on my left it's called the flamin versa i hear a dog doggo what the what the dog can i get it in here [Applause] double kill more doggers yeah this is the map if you want to level up can you do this not 24 7. i don't know i just unlocked a new opera solange there's dogs everywhere hey dog brewski what's up hey lulz comrade lemon what's up looks like a ps3 game wow hey cloud cupcake thank you two months appreciate that what's up jamal stephen looks like goldeneye but with worst controllers i think you're forgetting what gold and i look like although to be fair i remember when i when i was a kid and goldeneye came out i was i think i was about 12 years old i was like this is a pinnacle of graphics man it's never gonna get better than this it's never gonna get better i have to vote [Music] they're all as good as each other look that was weird why what was that in-game screen there the gammon bomb and the care package level 53 night vision oh that's this one's op everyone said this is op because it basically all right get this this weapon attachment i think it was it was true true game day is video i watched where is it is it magazine no is it kit no proficiency yeah okay look at this vital increased area for critical hits so i think what that does is it makes the torso the same as headshot damage i think based on what i've seen in other people's videos it basically increases the damage to the torso and bear in mind that the torso is the biggest area on a character model so everyone is going to take this i mean it is the last unlock level 55 but it just seems like compared to the others flinch resistance accuracy and recoil while injured suppressed reload quickness prone transition accuracy reload quickness while injured all of these when you can increase the damage of the torso why would you not want that there needs to be a bigger trade-off to that i mean that's kind of like a no-brainer for every gun in my opinion can you put that on snipers i don't know let's have a look [Music] i want to change this anyway i did quite like that scope though i don't know that one looks quite good um do i have a sniper class type 99 so i can't see yet i imagine that you can because that's also got 10 attachments like the time to kill in this game is already really really quick but then everyone can have a an attachment that increases the damage to the torso that seems a bit mad to me it is what it is right okay i need to put my xp tokens on so i think these have come across from have these come across from card warzone and cold war weapon xp token double xp token so they're both on apparently you get more xp if you play on playstation as well you just get a boost uh dead meat thanks for the 18 months two-year-old baby right there it's very kindly man what's up lorenzo hi love your vids thank you man stevie how you doing it's either vital or health regen you think okay what's up kev exorcist are you doing a campaign playthrough series i've done one i did it part one and part two campaign's about four and a half hours long the video and the live stream are already up for that how tall am i six one what's up anthony xp tokens are per game all right this is the mp4z i think it's an mp4 you can't you can't inspect i can't wait i'm not sure about the iron sight it kind of you lose it you didn't check characters yeah i need to look at the operator that i unlocked you guys said i unlocked two [Applause] this is an interesting map isn't this a this is an old world of war map isn't it i recognize this map [Applause] dean hey jack will you make your own server for portal yeah for sure i mean i'll make a few gamers for it he's not no one's playing the objective here it's castle yeah i thought i thought i recognized it it's a good map this is stabilizer unlocked that's the one isn't it jack would you grind for the camo's azan nah i'm not that kind of cod player i don't really care about camos that much you know like i get why people do and i've seen the atomic skin for this the atomic skin's kind of growing on me when i first saw it i was like nah that ain't it but then i've seen some screenshots and videos of it actually on guns and it looks quite good on the guns maybe i'll do it for one or two but i'm not really bothered i don't care about skins that much can i please jump over this dice yeah the mp40 is uh he's not the one for this one um markson rifle sniper snowstorm [Applause] dean will you do a full halo infinite play through yeah for sure i'm really looking forward to the uh infinite campaign i'm just the multiplayer in general you know i mean that sounds pathetic it's got a suppressor on it but i mean you sound great one shot is all i need double kill i'll tell you what this sniper is not bad this is the new warzone method i can't wait for the new warzone man back to the patrol zone it's gonna come at the perfect time as well because like this and uh 2042 would have been out for what like i don't know month or something and then the new warsaw map will drop oh this is inverted oh no someone else killed them all hey jonas noticed any meta weapons yet g cozy yeah yeah [Music] i didn't deserve that kill mp40 and stg it's got really slow ideas speed though although i was um watching stardom when he was playing this a couple days ago on launch day and um [Applause] he was pretty much like the snipers are short because there's no there's not really any attachments in vanguard that increase your ads speed that much um but i don't think he's unlocked everything so it'll be interesting to see like a fully leveled up sniper can you actually get quick ads speed on [Applause] does she kind of need that in war zone especially oh no doggos distracted me a glide bomb that's dumb well glide bombs are real things obviously obviously they won't remote control like they are in this game but they were real things oh come on guys v-rex thank you for the one that's very kind of man it put don't yeah dome was another world at war level wasn't it what's this artillery strike what's going on don't like that people just always camp up there don't they kobe i end up dying tonight yeah gta trilogy is out next month isn't it [Applause] you can do it every now and again it's a bombing run okay yeah i've not unlocked any killstreaks either really and the time to kill is so fast in this it's so quick god damn nice [Music] what happened then [Music] vital unlock there we go so i'm gonna have to put that on my scg for the next game you should play with westy i think west is doing um like an ad or something for tcl tonight so i don't you know i wouldn't want to interfere with that i need a grenade so i can get that guy maybe i shouldn't have popped it then because i'm slow now can i get up on them before the round ends come at me bros that's not a good idea going away no you can't slide cancel when you're this dude no we lost i mean hammered us today is not your day absolutely ruined us people dropping bombs in this game favorite american fast food restaurants i mean there's so much choice it's one of my favorite things about going to america just all the food options [Music] ed ratio most headshots most vote for this guy i'm trying to think i mean chick-fil-a popeyes we have five guys in the uk now so i'm not gonna say that one what's the other burger chain called is it in and out yeah in and out i had an absolutely awesome in-n-out burger when i was in los angeles once um wendy's i've been to wendy's in florida a couple times and i know some people rag on it and say that it's just like cheap and awful but let me tell you when you've been at a theme park all day and you're hungry and on the way home you can go into a wendy's and get yourself the full american stack breakfast at 10 p.m at night with unlimited coffee that hits the spot i'm just saying i'm just saying shake shack's pretty good they got good fries in and out do these things called animal uh animal fries and you can they have like a secret menu i don't understand though why would you have a secret menu why not just put it on the menu can anyone explain this to me look at this all right let's have a look at the stats sure it's not going to show me the details on that excuse me the rest of them have details why does not have details is it pretty self-explanatory i guess shake shack is in the uk now lee yeah they have one in london don't they i've been to the one in london era have i ever been to canada yeah i've been to montreal i went uh to ubisoft and there was snow everywhere it was awesome i loved it i mean patrol seems pretty chill so far it's not my hand shaking it's just my dpi 1600 so any hand movement on the menu is super quick and the reason i'm using 1600 dpi is because you get lower input lag ruber hi am i beautiful yes guns feel like modern warfare guns or cold war modern warfare it's the same engine adam there's a bit more visual recall on the guns though i'm not sure i'm a fan of it it's in warzone as well i don't know so now i've got a gun that just does more damage when i shoot people in the chest do you take your own baked beans to non-uk countries when traveling british people don't care about baked beans that much [Music] i think i just killed myself oh no i've got gallon bombs [Applause] oh there's like no footsteps either in this well there are some footsteps [Applause] heads up enemies [Applause] yeah the footsteps are really really quiet uh there's a guy that i watch called exclusive ace and uh he did a video today where he tested them on a private server and they're so hard to hear lost a lot of damage there didn't i couldn't even see that guy uh you can get ninja as well which basically gives you zero footsteps so it's like what's the point in dead silence if you can just take the ninja bug so i'd like the footsteps to be a bit louder why did i just get a hit mark or i didn't do anything ready for report calling an intel market hostile location i mean i can't fault the performance of the game the frame rate's really good colby you got here why are you guys all just saying beans you can't just say beans and it's okay it's visibility as hard as it seems visibility isn't [Music] one thing you can do though if you i think if you play on pc or next gen consoles if you go in the graphics turn on where is it good come on come on so many options fidelity cass turn this on um and you get you get a lot more visibility it just like increases the saturation a bit and it puts a sharpening filter on the game it's honestly trust me if you're on next-gen console or pc turn that on like it didn't really affect my fps at all like i'm getting like 230 20 fps guys can you please stop just saying beats i don't i don't understand have i done something wrong the the mere mention of baked beans has caused everyone to go crazy into a frenzy i mean yeah the muzzle smoke is is a bit excessive for me personally it was the last nation message oh i see guys that's uh okay it's still just beans i don't know what i don't i don't even i don't even know anymore okay you need like youtube's gonna think my streams just spam it'll be like oh this guy's just got some boxing just saying beans over and over again i'm dead you just know don't you when you see the glide bomb coming towards you you just get choked i'm gonna have to start playing a bit more camping now i reckon i've been sbm m'd it's caught up with me [Applause] it's an interesting map footsteps should stay how they are yeah i understand the argument because like in a card game if footsteps are too loud then they almost make the game a bit too campy because you just can always hear people if you get what i mean obviously if it's a game like cs or valor like you want you know you want that clarity and you want to be able to know okay there's someone there i'd like them to be a bit louder in this game i just feel like you know you just barely hear them no not like this blind bomb is one of the best streaks especially when playing patrol uh is this 1440p yeah yeah we're streaming 440p and 4k [Music] the quality should be really good does your red dot disappear when you go prone do i play valor and yeah yeah from time to time don't really stream it though there's a big um cs tournament at the moment the majors going on apparently there was a really good game that just happened but i missed it i was getting ready for the stream sad search love the content because of your riders stream i had to get it and had a blast yes don't forget our players yeah yeah riders is a great game uh christian thank you for the five atomic mastery camo is gorgeous and van gaal is really fun in my opinion it's better than modern warfare and vanguard is as good as cold war i'd say mechanically in my opinion this game feels a lot better than cold war like the gunplay in the movement that's probably because it's on the modern warfare engine and it's just a more modern engine the the frame rate's really good too dustin thanks for the fire that's up to you man come to you it's all subjective isn't it [Applause] i think i heard footsteps you make a lot of um noise on like muddy environments you don't really make any noise when you slide though after watching that exclusive ace video just barely make any noise when you slide see that guy heard me nine millimeter parabellum what is that can you shoot that down i feel like i'm lacking a bit of damage on this sdg stuff learn from this one call me when war zone 2 comes out a cash flow i think that's going to be next year yeah the rumors are the modern warfare 2 is coming out next year i said it in one of my previous warzone videos the last one i did in fact i think what's going to happen is infinity ward will be working on their warzone 2.0 they'll make a brand new map and i think they might scrap everything they might scrap modern warfare 19 cold war vanguard and do a clean slate and just launch warzone 2 2.0 with modern warfare 2. because i feel like if they just keep adding guns how many guns are going to be in the new cod game in modern warfare 2 another 30 at launch so does that mean there's going to be 180 guns in warzone like this they can't just keep adding guns the balance is going to get really difficult and the size of the game is going to keep increasing i just don't see how it's feasible so at some point they're going to have to draw a line and go right okay this is this is where we stop for now we're gonna start again is that football pitch so large this is the one that we just unlocked sprinter very good too very good she was also excellent i mean these are like really long intros for the characters [Music] she had the perfect life as a student i don't think most people care about this stuff like the the characters behind the multiplayer like there's the ones from the single player like wade's in the single player polina lucas arthur beatrice he looks cool chicanoy [Music] helena wade jackson have we unlocked any other guns [Music] this one's supposed to be the the boy so we'll go with the boy for now i haven't unlocked anything for you okay [Music] dominations try some domination deathclaw thank you for the twenty been a fan since bf3 days thanks for the great content excited to see your 2042 content thank you very much deathclaw i'm excited as well chew you can't just keep dropping dad jokes like this is only one set of characters like no axis choices i think so baby big swall baby big swell i think it's only one set yeah you know modern warfare 19 you had the two factions you had coalition and damn i can't remember the name of the other one i can't remember it but you have two factions i kind of like that though i prefer that domination so what's this ultimate how do you um that's okay the rate of fire is good i can't use this what okay i've got a site already look at this how do you know what do i eat oh my god hold on i need to put that on straight away there we go allegiance yeah is it allegiance yeah i think so something like that that's better actually got a sign on it now you know there's a lot of stuff in this game that reminds me of battlefield v this map reminds me of i can't remember the name of it it's one of the maps that was supposed to be for the competitive 5v5 mode that they scrapped and it has like lavender fields in it do you know the one i mean what's the name of it that's way better actually got a sight on it it's like the federal yeah kind of uh winter thank you for the two good to see you provence see you guys you guys are way smarter than i am you have the tractor on it that you drive you know one thing that i really like about this game so far the amount of maps like it's like 20 maps or something so i think oh my goodness i think on launch there's a ton of variation here it's like i haven't played the same amount twice yet you know that's my kill there's a lot to unlock as well so progression is going to be good there's someone flanking say dude this thing is nuts what the hell this is going to be insane in warzone it's actually going to be insane in warsaw friendly glide bomber incoming do i get gun xp for capturing things like in modern warfare is that how it works in this game as well i'm out though try and find the tractor in cod to be honest with you i don't think there'll be a drivable tractor in this game a federal on steroids i think that's a good description of it sunny boy yeah nice work kind of uh threw me into that match at the end [Music] can you actually unlock different animations as well there's no story in the game here it's kind of weird isn't it that gun looks broken af sam maybe i mean i'm gonna make a nice build for it what's my fov 100 ed from red what did we get to 14 13 splatterfest muzzle compensator stock hit fire i don't think you'd hit fire that rife as a rifle anyway so it's fine it's just a load of skulls what the hell what is that that doesn't look like a nor an animal from earth ninja's level 15 so i've nearly got that demolition play some more domination can we see the operators yeah that's it this is all you get for now i don't think there's another faction or anything they're gonna add loads with the live service i think obviously if it's a year of live service that'll be massive by the end friendly bombing is it a good is it from 1916. it's put me into another game halfway through again i get another map that i haven't played i just killed myself in an explosive barrel maybe it'd be good if you could just play as american soldier german soldier that counts as my kill does it okay [Applause] i thought that was a ui thing a red enemy this map is quite big as well i appreciate that andrew that's very generous of you man thank you very much andrew super kind you're a legend losing objective charlie [Applause] i still got my xp on don't i hold those positions it's quite a large area this he's a gun from 1916. well i suppose wasn't this guy named bf1 so yeah it kind of makes sense it's from 1916. how'd you get up there it turns out he just jumped sorry who killed me then oh there's a little platform there that's cheeky that is uh death call thanks again very kindly losing objective cod ghost was not good yeah i wasn't a fan of cocos at all it was an interesting take on zombies though wasn't it it was like aliens wasn't it like these little it was kind of like starship troopers [Applause] hey okay i just jumped right in front of a shotgun i was like who killed me there's another guy there it doesn't quite have the range but i reckon when you got some attachments on it okay in the single player it takes one bullet to kill the dogs in the multiplayer no what's the answer what the hell why is she screaming like that taking able she went a bit joker there i want to get off this side of the map sick of it can i get the high ground out again [Applause] they're taking able no i just stumbled at the dog bro these uh these dogs are killing me well that gun was called the shredder like from ninja turtles it's quite a campy map this one isn't it securing faker it's kool-aid then no let me call leeds come on dude i just wanted to be kool-aid and you've ruined my life they're taking able they're taking able i'm the most british man you thought that they found the most british man in modern warfare 19 but i am in fact the most british man you've ever seen or heard on the entire planet and so i've been hired by call of duty to do the voice in the game so you know that everything's quite serious and this is war enemies i want to play a game of domination from the start you know casey thanks for five it was a bit harley quinn wasn't it this isn't the braider yeah it's the federal the braider is in the game though bob rob there is a braider it's a bus you can i think you can take someone out in one burst with it [Music] uh chum the goliath remote bomb is broken you have to try it out you can run people over with it okay soviet the doggo was going to take me down i would just i just shot it with the nerf with nerf bullets and just you know just having a nice rest that's all i like the actor on kingsley yeah he's pretty good f8 stabilizer that's that's the best attachment isn't it for the muzzle accuracy recall jones to stay in fire i like ads speed though i've unlocked any camos yet you're kidding me dice can you try the as44 have i even unlocked that yet where is it that's the burst rifle is it in marksman okay i played this map already um any codes i do have i do have some codes to give away actually i've got three codes we'll drop them later in the chat i need to get them though need to get them from my emails domination move out and secure the objective i need that precious xp closing with able capturing we took the advantage he's do you have modern warfare yeah maker you thought i was american john that's not true i don't know how anyone could hear my accent and think i was american are you trolling if you're not trolling fair enough but i feel like you're trolling you trolling dog i mean i suppose you could be american and have a british accent right like if you lived there let's say your parents were british and you know they had very british accents guys can you stop throwing on the ground please where in america am i from you guys crack me up bud you're silly throw it back oh dice oh no they're in the spawn now chalked copy oh come on you kept on shooting didn't you of course you did i don't understand how stun grenades can kill people like why is that a thing does it do one damage or something no i've got just got someone again with the stun grenade call me [Music] i'm from texas nice to meet you sir how are you doing yeah this is the smg map isn't it oh it's camping holder corner that's a glitch in the map there isn't it upstairs oh no it's nothing capturing so there's no no there is a right shield oh there's the right shield yeah it's quite a late unlock though so i don't think you'll see many people with it yet actually saying that someone's probably unlocked it already it's like level 42 or something if you were grinding this from early access yeah someone's probably got it already uh neon thank you for the 10. oh this lab nice that guy is always there as his favorite spot on the map i live here now this is my position and i don't move from here and this is where i live and he will never ever kill me in a million years because this is my position [Music] you're from the west midlands yes i am genuine fear that scream it's explosions then [Music] this map is crazy there he is there he is i couldn't get him no oh i need to kill that guy mp40 no no no where is he he's not there that's where he lives no honestly what is this map design this map design is for people who just want to grind [Music] guns it's not supposed to be balanced or tactical this is this is like the shipment of card vanguard but vanguard is getting shipment as well so [Music] you know i think this is just sledgehammer games there's a little bit there making their own version i suppose of shipment and just letting people have at it at launch i'm not sure when shipments actually being added it's just part of live service i think what's the goal in this game though just run forward and die on this map yeah that's i mean that's it isn't it like you just run forward die everyone that's where i was before just kept sliding into grenades uh callum will i be playing battlefield at launch oh yeah 100 neon thanks to the 100 can you talk like a road map what's a road man shipment is coming november 17th oh that's soon okay yeah shipment is um is the mvp for leveling up guns you just spawned behind me it's so annoying my legs are gone [Applause] is in it's so much easier from the side of the map there's spawn behind us though let's try in the back losing objective charlie fly bomber assist coming in yeah this gun's nuts charlie is lost that's a friendly dog am i good at making curry um not from scratch i would say no i mean i can you know do some checking get some lloyd grossman bit of rice with a naan bread but anyone can do that three-rock do that that's not really making curry is it so the answer is no i'm sorry i don't think i want to play this map again like this is the leveling up map like in terms of gameplay it's not great because you just run forward and dive run forward and die there's not really any tactics here it's like i said it's shipment isn't it oh my god the amount of enemies in that room cheers [Music] yeah if this map comes up again i'll quit i'd rather just experience the other maps because that's just chaos done i'm not sure the music goes with the world war two theme [Music] sunny day videos i'm good man thank you you think they just slapped some meat to record that sound effect [Music] that's what i do i just get some meat and just start slapping it it's over and over [Music] add in a few claps a bit of reverb [Music] i could do i could do sounds for video games i could do it hire me it's fine right we'll use a different gun now i'm gonna play zombies i might at the end of the stream yeah i might give it a go i've only played it a little bit what settings am i using i'll show you one second 440p 240 hertz oh oh it's smooth medium medium low low on low off standard low low low low off low low on on medium low low off off off off on sma a 2t t2 x dammit i nearly had it depth of field off vram usage 90 there you go that's what i'm using i was trying to do the whole thing hold on we need more xp tokens guys come on what am i doing come on weapon xp maybe i should save these for when shipments out so i can just like grind myself into a pulp um patrol again we'll do patrol what do i think about the intel 12th gen cpus i've bought one piece i have it downstairs but i don't know what motherboard memory or cooler to buy so i don't it's just in the box so i don't know what i think about it i like the box it's got good packaging comes in a little gold wafer why medium low settings just because you get better visibility that's castle again i don't want to play that oh that's fine oh you get better visibility better performance lower input lag i've been to new york joseph no i haven't i'd like to though i'd like to go what's up unique freak thank you for coming i can't find ddr5 anywhere i literally can't find it and the websites that i've been on they offer bundles and pcs with it in so i think what's happening is because it's so expensive and so sought after at the moment the oems and the system builders are only selling it if you buy bundles or systems i totally get that i understand but i would just like to buy some ddr5 you know on its own because i'm i build my own pcs normally so i i can't where can i buy it in the uk if someone can show me where to buy it i'll buy it abolish sub for years love you love you too bro thank you where can i buy hacks i don't know juicy oh i've not played this one are you not bored of playing warzone louie yeah i mean i haven't played warzone properly for ages i don't play it regularly anymore i'm gonna hammer it though when the new maps out uh what's it worn hey mr tom face am i gonna play gta trilogy yes i'll be streaming it you can use ddr4 for now i'd rather not though like if i build a new system i just want to have it done um type 99 we've tried the stg defend the objective it's all riding on this bring your best or go you idiot oh my goodness three people ask corsair for some i'm not that guy you know i don't i understand that i could just send a tweet to corsair hey can we talk and then just get some but i don't want to do that like that ain't me i'd rather buy it you know fine to to spend for the business i'd rather buy it this is a good spot i like this spot there's a slide up here shot uh ridicule green thank you i want to see some sniper action you know this map might be a good sniper one actually um i'll switch where is it that one i like how no one literally look at the score zero zero not a single person has gone in the pressure zone yet that's called a g right there that's that's playing the objective in call of duty literally no one has gone in it there are no points on the board that's so funny how long is this how long has this round been going on for ready i mean it's been going on a while right few minutes who's going to be the first person to go to go in the objective wouldn't be me that wouldn't be me i mean i did okay i did actually try and get it straight away but i got instantly killed okay i'll get it i'll get it don't worry don't worry i'm gonna go i'll be the first person look ptfo guys watch hey we scored two points let's go we're two nil up on patrol this is unbelievable right now is there any bullet drop at that kind of distance probably not more booth how do you grow on youtube oh man it's really it's really difficult nowadays but there are lots of systems in place to help you grow i mean i've answered this before on a stream but i'll do it again you have to use the systems that youtube are promoting in their algorithm so if i was a new channel i'd be posting a lot of shorts on whatever topic whatever niche that you think is you know interesting i'd be live streaming a couple days a week [Applause] and i'd i'd be what the i'll be posting a couple of like high quality videos per week with high production quality um i wasn't even aiming at you but i killed you [Music] also community posts polls stuff like that that appears on the mobile app find a niche find something you enjoy make content on it um consistency is key as well also you gotta like have interesting titles and thumbnails like your title and your thumbnail is like 99 on youtube and have a good intro as well that hugs people ready for target you need an intro that people go oh you know what this is an interesting subject or topic i'm going to stay and watch more than 30 seconds because like the the attention span of people nowadays is so short because of mobile phones and social media and and all the apps and all these distractions and it's so saturated you've gotta you've gotta offer something that really hooks people as soon as they uh get onto your video but i do not envy anyone that's trying to do it full-time nowadays starting from scratch anyway so difficult so i use this bomb why did that explode in the air did it hit a trio i really like this sniper this reminds me of star wars battlefront endor it's indoor isn't it there's the death star it's almost exactly the same as that area of endor on star wars no the bombs can be shot down oh is that what happened [Applause] i feel like patrol is revived though man this this game was it just seems way more chill than all the how did i others that i've not even been over this part of the map yet the most there's three the three most important factors on youtube click through rate which is how many people click on your thumbnail when it's been served to them watch time and uh title of them now i kind of put those into the same category [Music] dude that slide is disgusting what the hell what's up antonio does it support 120 fps on next gen julian i don't know i would imagine yes because um warzone does right please confirm you did it i don't know if you can get 120 fps with this game on old consoles that doesn't make sense because they don't have the hdmi 2.1 [Music] what's up sergeant match how do i like the scopes they're a bit weird tim's they're kind of hard to get used to to be honest warzone isn't 120 on ps5 i think they updated it max i think it is now as far as i'm aware you can get 120 on ps5 and series x for warzone i don't know about this game though i know this has got fov for console some people really like to change their fov on console i get it the default is usually like 60 to 80 on console and you're playing against pc players who have like a hundred so totally understand what the game modes are there s and d i mean that's everyone knows what s d is it's counter strike isn't it tdm domination i want to level up my mp40 i feel like i need to play what would be good for mp40 domination find another patrol so you can get a small map [Music] hello egg uh the campaign seems to have better graphics oh yeah richie 100 yeah the graphics and campaign are way better than this but i'm not playing on high settings i'm playing mostly on low medium but typically speaking when you've got a multiplayer and single player in your game the single player graphics will be a lot better and the reason for that is because you can put more detail infidelity in because you don't have to worry about having 24 players on the map you can make smaller sections which have a lot more detail that will still run at good frame rates that's why single player games typically look better than multiplayer patrol you don't have to worry about network performance tick rate any of that stuff thank you for sliding into my diy can i get rid of that yeah this map was in the beta in the back what's up axel films hey robert um am i gonna play elden ring when it comes out yeah blaine um i've been playing it last couple days i'm in the closed network test there'll be a video soon i did say that at the start of the stream but i think everyone missed it some people missed it what the hell was that [Music] i mean the time to kill there do i know how many bones are in a chicken foot the chicken feet even have phones in them the answer's not friendly friendly how'd you know was that foxy thank you the five sorry i'm trying to read and pay attention to the game i mean i would say if you want to try bf just get ea play i think you can do a 10 hour trial on uh yeah play pro is it or something so then you just you know you just spend five dollars to try it and see what you think you can play for 10 hours i think please correct me if i'm wrong i like that room that's my room obviously this you know this is 60 so you you know do you have a it's bucks disposable income can you afford to spend 60 bucks right now is that that same guy yeah it is he's got a sick build for that ultimate thing i kind of wish you could copy builds i'm sure that was a feature in old cod games this dude's got a fire shotgun did an mp40 just do that are you kidding me i'll be that guy i'll be that cod player [Laughter] oh it's so scummy but it feels so good [Applause] if i unlock ninja hostile recon in the air rage in this game would be for real what's the point of raging at video games though it's all just meaningless fun and time wasting isn't it there's no consequence of buying in a video game so what's the point in getting angry at it no i thought the ai of those dogs could be a bit better they just run and stop and run and stop hostile took the patrol zone maybe they dumbed them down a bit or something okay local regal hello i was mounted hello dice please i hide here now [Music] death by a german shepherd thank you robert that dog was on like a 10 kill streak [Applause] oh yes we are give me that weapon xp give me the weapon xp yes oh this guy was in my game before is how strict the skill-based matchmaking is i saw something hilarious earlier by the way with someone who was uh exploiting skill-based matchmaking it was really funny i might do a video about it because it's just insane the lens that people go to the lengths that people go to to get in easy lobbies why do i never get i think i've been on this screen once i'm not bad isn't it a doberman no the doberman's the other one that's a german shepherd isn't it that was a great dog impersonation jack michael curtis thank you i practiced that one i went to the actors guild for dog impressions and they taught me how to do it i actually spoke to a real dog and they were like you really you could be better your dog could be better and then i spent years training with a german shepherd called brian eventually he was pleased you've been at eagle's nest can you visit frederick is it like a museum now when you do stream with doc i don't really know doc to be honest like i'd love to play with him but i don't know him so you know if it happens it happens ninja what does 45 do reduces damage [Music] about the stem as well the shredder the bad guy from turtles uh i'm the only swift thanks for the five 50. more daisy nah i'm kind of done with survival games to be honest dude i get bored of them uh t thanks for the five i've got one code for pc one for xbox and one for playstation i think it's the ultimate edition of the game as well that mp4 is not bad isn't it bad but you see round mag [Music] have i seen the manchester derby no man city one didn't they two no i think i've not seen it though i didn't watch it [Music] there were ten attachments ross in total for the guns i've not played this one let me go play this one either patrol take the objective show [Applause] look it's that guy again you just play against the same players because spm goes and would you like some paint i don't want to play against the same people over and over again try domination how do you participate for the code i just put it in chat bubba crazy bubba and then first come first serve you know whoever's quick enough gets it how many attachments is too many um i mean 10 is pretty crazy louis it's just i think it gives it a bit more depth but it's also a lot harder to balance and i think there's more opportunities for things that are overpowered and unbalanced have i seen the snyder cut yeah i have watched it all it's good way better than the um the optical cut put me in a game again just like nearly finished the doggos are out already [Applause] do i think halo needs a battle royale no i don't think it needs a battle royale i think it would be uh interesting to see it i'd love to play a battle royale but halo doesn't need far rail no it doesn't halo infinite just needs to be a good halo game and like from what i've played and from what they've shown in in the the campaign trailer that's what it looks like it looks like a good halo game so i'm i'm here for it i'm dead okay so that is all exposed there this is not the map for an mp4 i can't wait to play the the halo campaign i'm gonna be streaming that as soon as it comes out in the sky i think i got him with the ned securing able allies maybe sniper on this stop will be good cj what is this this is a garand isn't it yeah this is the ground that they had in warzone sounds good what's this killstreak oh someone's great this is straight out the single player this level it's the ultimate head glitch there lots of visual recall on this they're crushing us they're crushing us mates oh i wish i could leave there i don't want to see this screen at the end all the time just want to get straight into a game yeah it's kind of weird to see a drum mag on a garand some people say that it's um the pronunciation is garand as well the proper pronunciation of it is garand but most people that i know say garand i don't know why it is what it is yeah i've not dropped any codes yet julian i'll do them towards the end a straight dope flip script thank you for five very nice hello richie hell let loose is far better than this i mean he'll let loose is a completely different game to call of duty richie if you prefer it that's fine different type of game though there's a lot of console players james hi jack have you noticed much difference going from 400 dpi to 1600 dpi it just feels a little bit more responsive we're talking milliseconds but if you want to get every advantage that you can milliseconds start to stack up so even if you might not feel it just knowing that it's there and it's optimized that has a big effect on your confidence and how you play acosta mkd 100 i have no idea what currency that is no idea mkd i'm gonna google it i've never heard of it north macedonia there you go domination domination defend the objective time to get lain and me capturing charlie much love from croatia thank you i've got a higher sense in this as well than i use a warzone like just because pod is so fast-paced that i think you need a quicker sense look at the size of that scope one shot is all i need it's got a quick reload on this i think there's one on the right still watch out oh you weren't stunned enough hello from finland what's up dmitry please can you make a weird sound now oh you just got my finesse my friend with able an enemy just look at this look at this kill again just ran right past me oh dude that would have been so funny if i'd killed that guy [Applause] looking at the chat what would you class as a weird sound i'm like that's pretty weird isn't it i guess something like that maybe but i wouldn't do a weird sound it's not a stream all right hello from mars oh we got salad what's mars like at this time of the year you got good internet out there losing objective able what kind of ping do you get on mars i live on mars and i've got 50 000 ping [Applause] you reckon right obviously not in our lifetime like any anyone that's watching this stream sorry guys you're gonna die at some point not in our lifetime but at some point in the future there will be humans living on mars how crazy is that what will be the first video game that's played on mars i think it'll be something retro like nasa will go there and just be like hey look lads we're playing pong on mars that's the kind of thing nasa would do enemies spies in the sky friendly sending a glide bomb where the enemies oh there's one taking able give me the xp doom oh yes dude doom would be perfect wouldn't it because the whole game is about mars the sims that's not going to be the sims come on ready for report this sniper's sick humans will never live on mars i think they will ow oh my god this chat is so fast it is isn't it difficult to keep up with it sometimes nah it's gonna be a classic guys it's not gonna be the sims oh no you know what snipe this if it's roblox then humanity's doomed [Applause] you should live on mars nah there's nothing there they don't have disney world so i wouldn't i'll just get bored they're taking charlie charlie is overrun have i nearly got oh no i think i

lightyear the movie do you mean light year it looks great louie i love it i like what they're doing with it you know it's not if you weren't aware the story is about the real life person that inspired the toy story toy in the toy story universe there's a lot of layers there obviously buzz lightyear is not a real person in real life but in the toy story universe the buzz lightyear toy was based off an astral core astra court astro court an astronaut called let's go with stephen and and that movie is about his story so i think it's going to be very sad and he's going to sacrifice himself for the human race and everyone will be really upset but it'll be a great movie and it'll look great and it'll uh sell a load of toys for disney yeah nice dice explosions there is a plasma engine coming out

i don't know if i can do that have i unlocked any new guns would you recommend full hd 120 hertz or 4k 60 for ps5 i stephen mackenzie i always prefer frame rate over resolution for multiplayer single player 60 fps 4k that's fine for me multiplayer i'd always go frame rate over fidelity resolution just because it feels better it looks better less input lag smoother what's up life on two wheels how are you doing any upcoming games you're excited about that isn't an fps um god of war 2 alden ring hmm dying light 2 does that's not i mean it is a first person game but it's not really a first person shooter is it use the bl have i even unlocked the bl i don't know let's have a look i'm not unlocked here guys sorry it traverse still trying that tracker you see track is really good in this lightweight you just get two grenades whatever i'll try the intra forza is out already isn't it if you've got early access i think bar sucks donkey don't use it okay hello fallout guy from greece what's up do i need a special hdmi table for a table cable for a 4k tv no you don't straight up gamer any hdmi cable will work unless you've got one from the 1960s i like the thompson did i yes i did you're right okay that could be good to use as well [Applause] oasis i don't think i've played this map on the objective don't recognize it yeah i've got one pc code to give away harold we're just playing vanguard tonight buddy i don't really see the point in playing bf4 anymore when 2042 is out i might like go back to it um like in a couple years or something same with like all the old battlefield games i am stunned you can use oh you can use the bar with the pre-made okay this will be an interesting gun for war zone as well what the bloody hell is going on here then hey i'm not sure this is the one it looks like a tank issue it's your birth sucks yeah i'm feeling that way james thank you for becoming a member although much you know can beat you well why am i burning you're friendly i saw a shadow then [Applause] enemy war machine inside enemy war machine that's the grenade launcher it's not bad you know considering there's no attachments on it maybe you could make it knock sir hello from honduras what's up alessandro how you doing ah also um i have streamer mode on right you know earlier i was like i'll keep playing against the same people it's just because i've got streamer mode on geez that guy got triple there i'm such an idiot sometimes man [Music] hostile recon in the [Applause] you know maybe it doesn't maybe it doesn't suck guys maybe it doesn't soak yeah i can't stream at any of the old battle games so some people just hate me just they get hacks during the server and just rage huh but i don't think they'll be able to do that in 2042 so i can actually stream 2042 which i'm really looking forward to imagine the amount of stuff we could do like we could make portal game modes and stuff we could just play all that warfare whatever got an enemy war machine coming up it's quite nice to mount this beatrice oh the mountain actually ruined me though i like this map it's cool reminds me for like a paintball arena or something you could snipe a map this would stephen this is actually just unlock the site for it [Applause] oh come on that second burst should have got him do i have anti-aliasing turned off no it's on the lowest setting though [Applause] oh yeah what are you doing there buddy too slow with the stun [Applause] got him [Applause] uh can i can i see i'll be i'd love i'd love to be able to see it i mean if you get the burst with a headshot it takes me one burst i hated that so much have i played fifa yet no i haven't i do have it though i've got it on ps5 i've not not tried to play it yet though i haven't had time to be honest i've been so busy see there though it's kind of bad right like if you hit the extremities you've got to hit the chest in the head i wonder if i could um let's put whatever on it for now i'll try with this scope on it i mean that looks too quick to shoot down unless you had a rocket launch or something today is not your day i don't know just get oh that guy doesn't have a head it's the invisible man what is that what the hell how was that play of the game [Music] mark thanks for the five jack 30 series cars have hdmi 2.1 does that mean you can get 120 hertz on 4k tvs yeah if the tv has a 2.1 port mustafa who do i support i don't really support anyone salzenberg i used to be a wolves fan with a season ticket when i was a kid that's because i was born in wolverhampton but i just kind of got bored of going to matches and i just watch highlights now football instead i want to try the thompson for a bit tdm graphics look grainy yeah it's because of this fidelity cast it adds sharpening and saturation which makes visibility way better so i'm saying if you've got a pc or next-gen console turn that on see if you like it for me it's a big improvement i was testing it before i started the stream i just joined a few games and just you know turned it off and on and off and on and i think it's like the game looks way better with it on in terms of being able to identify targets but it does add a bit of grain to it yeah sure all right let's try this uh thompson i'm not cool nice i'd like to see the baby this is a new map as well i've not played this one dead have i watched peep show i haven't seen the whole thing dean i've seen some episodes of it i've seen a lot of clips of it on youtube as well [Applause] stupid shouldn't have engaged that guy at range [Applause] can i go up here recon sweep of the sector any time i can kool-aid i'm doing it hello dead there's a trench of it what excuse me did that man have incendiary bullets they actually keep those in the game i'm not a fan of that [Applause] that's not cool aid there's just no footsteps either actually [Applause] i don't get it like i said earlier i think they need to be a bit louder everyone's just going to run this ninja park and then there's just no footsteps and it's weird adjustable stopped is there an fov slider on next-gen consoles yeah i think there is this is a bad angle to push but [Music] did it anyway all right what are you firing up it's weird isn't it like it's just it needs it needs footsteps maybe this map isn't the best for thompson kool-aid oh please kool-aid if i'd have kool-aided him i'd have won that for sure loud footsteps would cause camping yeah to some degree but a little bit louder than this right like there's just nothing [Music] they have the advantage oh it changed [Applause] genuine fearless that sounds kind of creepy isn't it just a good scream like it's it sounds genuine there's a guy here [Music] can you get overkill in this game oh you are kidding me [Music] the dog out of nowhere it's actually painful no more dogs wow 69 nice what the hell he's completely invisible now he's naked so previously he had his clothes on now naked is that me no it's not me i called for that i want to be the dog though you know when i call that kill streak in let me control the dog [Music] fan turn bam phantom [Music] most time near enemies i vote for that it's john cena was it okay give me give me a small level so i can use my thompson give me some of that give me some stuff give me some double xp as well yeah that's what i want oh yeah baby oh yeah yeah yeah some of that oh oh i can't believe i did like i did that thing with streamer mode i'm always playing against the same people you've got streaming mode on jack you idiot god that's house no that much nothing but pain pain do i have a favorite band no have you seen jurassic park fenton no i haven't okay it's it's the map where no one does anything again that's cool not great for thompson though xp still counts down in the menus allen yeah it did that in modern warfare as well i'm not a fan of that i'd rather only count it down when you're actually in the game protect the objective i'm gonna need some smoke this like i'm gonna run around here and get sniped fine pain excuse me i died so fast then [Applause] one point we got one point guys one point let's go baby this isn't the map for the thompson [Applause] i like that sniper it's good have i even unlocked smoke grenades i don't know have a look yeah dogs already oh wait dogs took the patrols [Music] this is this dog baiting me what's going on oh my goodness [Music] oh guys please do i have a job in real life this is my job content creator is my job i've been full time for 10 years oh that's okay this stg has got a slow rate of fire that means it must have a different ammo type on it i think i think that's what that means control zone secure good shot you like the little cutscenes at the end fair enough i think i'm gonna like i'm gonna like them when there's more variety because at the moment everyone's just got the same animation like it needs he's a bit of variety for [Music] you can me up on the roof of this can't you yeah [Music] [Applause] high bandits was amazing that's an old one grave well thank you [Applause] play on tactical mode what does that mean is that just less players [Applause] i'm a troll yeah that guy's got a shield you know how early we were talking about people are chills that guy has a shield oh you can get in there i like that i'm going to go up [Applause] fight there no are you there the whole time hey last bullet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is the place to be with a sniper in the search when you you can select how many players you want to go up against yeah yeah that's just a different type of um pacing isn't it they call it [Applause] shut that man square in the chest [Applause] someone covering this corner isn't it we got an empty patrol zone [Applause] running outside get that zone enemy glide bombing coming ptfo as much as i can tiny tiny gun it is quite a small gun isn't it that pistol it's called the it's called the rats it's got a really fast way of firing it though i wonder what that one is based off i don't know [Music] there's no new weapons in this call of duty there's quite a few new ones that sniper scope looks annoying it's not the best um i must have unlocked one by now see that's a cool animation i don't think i've seen that one before i'm gonna vote that guy just because i had a cool animation takarev is that oh makarov yeah it kind of looks like a makarov doesn't it to be fair low settings yeah uzi tt40 do i think they should remove dead silence from war zone completely yeah i do i think they should dead silence and stop in power they're not in iron trials and iron trials in my opinion is by far the best type of war zone experience [Music] you can get a 10x time okay or 10x times 10x telescopic variable 4a i feel like the 10x is uh the way forward there [Music] owen gun that's the one that the australian has in the campaign isn't it what lmg's are there mg42 combat shotgun car 98 that's going to be sick in war zone because they'll have a separate car 98 obviously warzone already has a car 98 because it was in modern warfare but this will be the vanguard car 98 in war zone and i think it's going to be pretty damn good try shotguns i'd have to get a small map to try shotguns lengthened hello point is just more damage increases limb damage accuracy stabilizer [Music] uh ricardo thanks for the five i wish you could play right now i won't let me download on xbox why not recorder damage range [Music] you can take the stock off as well [Music] i mean there's so much like how how would you how would you pick like it's so difficult to choose what to go with that's more xp melee range get 20 round mag on it this is a war crime is what you're saying maybe the default mag is the best option look at that camo no i don't like that this is what the final camo is atomic it's like an oil slick moving with a bit more vibrance and saturation to it oh hi alert i've unlocked that now

guys if you uh became members tonight uh you can join up on the discord if you want to this has got really fast abs movement speed if you go to jackframes.com discord there's instructions on there how

sure i was like is that a shadow or did someone just jump over me someone jumped over me there you go it's quite a small map i think a lot of this is destructible right [Applause] hello i am the camper i think i accidentally switched out my sdg there i didn't mean to do that yeah i like this build hardpoint is i feel like this is putting out a lot of damage a gravity thank you where irl map this looks like one of those um you know in the war i don't know if the germans did this or the russians but i know that the british and the americans did it they would make fake towns or fake factories you see these trees here they're just made out of wood and like camo netting and the reason they did this was to confuse bombers and people doing recon so they would look at this and go oh the allies have a base north west of france in some town somewhere but really it's it's a it's a bait you know it's not real so then the germans would focus their attention on this area or bomb it [Applause] even though there's nothing here it's just a it's just a fake village a fake base and they would even make inflatable tanks and stuff to confuse recon really interesting just a big debate i think this is supposed to look fake i see a head then yeah this is doing way more damage with the current build i have look at that pre-fire i mean from my pov it was nothing like that maybe i just couldn't see him you'd love an inflatable tank for the summer i think an inflatable tank would be quite fun don't you obviously you can't drive it because you know quite dangerous isn't it but it would be fun to just have in the garden yeah there's superman over here who wouldn't who wouldn't love an inflatable time let's be honest can we get another new member there as well hardpoint located gravity and wildland thank you so much oh there's an angle there look at that [Applause] basically when you get into 1v1 and call of duty nowadays you have to jump if you don't jump you've lost the 1v1 [Applause] just land up there a death claw thank you my name is deathclaw [Applause] deathclaw's a good name i like that please let me throw it back dice oh my god it went behind me [Applause] oh my god grenades oh they're just grenades in the middle of the field rob thank you the sudden drop shots are annoying yourself there's not really that many drop shots i've found in this or at least not in my lobby i mean people do slide like this we [Applause] not really had many drop shots though is there an attachment you can get which makes drop shots better he's absolutely cracked out of his mind on g4 fight the russian mags on the stg what's the deal with the russian mags 69. i mean that was just more more damage wasn't it so of course dude these dogs are so annoying no problem michael thank you for watching [Music] what's up [Applause] i think that guy's got the russian max because that ttk is insane got that visibility is really bad there as well so hard to track people sometimes because the smoke from the guns stop flipping a bear in the try the air directly below the stg eli yeah we were using it earlier the auto automaton or something it's called right it was good yeah i mean i i haven't really unlocked anything for it though sir i think i'll need to yeah i think that automation is going to be um like really good for warzone as well what time is it in the uk half 11 at night what's up robert barnes how are you doing rhaegar doctor disrespect mentioned you what's your biz fight option will be called to see you and walls on yours yeah i'll be down is this jumping simulator sometimes somehow can you zero weapons no if you can't [Music] is ricochet running on this not yet freddie ricochet is coming on december the second with the new warzone up so it's just got whatever anti-cheat the game had from before [Music] stg simulator yeah everyone's using it you have the 20 round russian mag do i i'm 61 20 round that one surely you want you need a 30 round though don't you i mean i'll try 20. i want to play free for all i think let's try 34 for a bit do people even play free-for-all anymore let's see hey mark thank you [Music] yep into a game please play squad sometime i've not played squad for ages d love from india what's up rohit thank you man yeah let's try these uh all targets no friends funny rounds critical why did you pee i mean good luck here in footsteps is this the same level i was playing earlier this is massive i didn't even go down here hollow point okay that's what i wanted like that just seems like a no-brainer for this gun or for all the guns to be honest is that thompson i know it's unfortunate i mean i just spawned behind that guy i feel like you should at least have client-side footsteps please let me up dice how are they below me [Applause] lol stunned myself [Music] okay fuse out here thousand grenades acting all tough oh [__] about him who's in here [Music] [Applause] where did you go oh behind me yeah damn it you're not dead i stopped firing i thought he was dead idiot yeah these russian mags do a lot of damage [Applause] i think maybe it's not a bad fit for free fall either because you only ever really fight against one person at a time right so 20 mags is enough 20 bullets sorry quite a quick reload as well what the hell was that mark in hostile locations i'm sorry he was right there that's funny yeah squeeze through here two kills behind is it first to 20 or 50. [Music] what's the optimus hello john's the crazy boy one kill die one kill die one kill die i need to get a street going [Applause] one kill die one kill die maybe a suppressor would help i don't know second you shoot you're on the minimap aren't you so [Applause] i didn't see you can we win this one chat what do you think i just wish there was footsteps you know i'll be good i'll uh i thought i thought i'd put it on let's have a look i have put it on is it not working we're drawing for the lead now tying at least okay you're kidding me no so close need one more kill he's winning now by one point three seconds now there's one oh what sorry how about one victory i was one i was one kill less that's not that's not a victory i look definitely wasn't working then [Music] yeah you can't hear your own footsteps if you've got ninja i think i didn't hear any footsteps in this game mocha uh yeah um i didn't really i heard it once when someone's printed right next to me and i killed them that was it 1911. top three counts as a win that's weird it's free for all the winners should be whoever gets first and that's it um kale confirmed i've not tried that yet kill confirmed is there vehicles no there's not jon's no vehicles what gun stg look with the 20 round mag yeah i don't think high alert was working unless there's a counter to it or something i don't know i just didn't see it once did any of you guys see it ninja's so good that everyone's gonna take it why wouldn't you take ninja you know oh hollow points yeah good point i forgot big boss coxy thank you for right reminding me um yeah hello take out all enemies [Applause] you know what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna forget about footsteps and just just look you can't you can't rely on footsteps there's no footsteps in this game it's gone so just forget about it that's the way i'm gonna approach this now i mean that significantly increased the damage at that range i mean come on no wonder the is the metagun [Applause] hey pablo [Music] look at that that's insane okay hollow point plus russian mag why would you use anything else look at that look at that oh my god that was a double kill ridiculous that's just a no-brainer insane okay right the game's changed now okay i mean the damage increase [Music] this is how we win the game now we can and we just beam everyone i've got the br that's absolutely nuts nice nice i'll tell you what it took way too long to do that i mean it's easy mode now game's easy we won as soon as you get those two unlocks the russian mags and the hollow points sgg mean no wonder i was losing so many gunfights before [Applause] quad kill love that energy but didn't matter they shot me first okay that's fine [Applause] ah i want to get into their spawn and then pop the flame for okay mr pre-fired what just happened that was completely accidental how has that killed me i feel sick let's go doggos i feel like i've gotten dressed apart with the velociraptors no it's gonna get me again isn't it you absolute whoa that's fine so you know let it wash away it's fine [Applause] this thank is hahaha he's literally changed the game for me last okay high alert work then first time i've noticed it at least i'd love to go back and start with these mags to start the stream again okay come back stronger the toy story tank yeah it's kind of off camera the flaming buffer yes indeed live many lives then yes this is true [Music] that sounds just too funny guys i can't take it it's just so funny mvp lola look at that playstation code xbox code and a pc code so the playstation codes and the xbox codes are ultimate editions so this is first come first serve right so whoever gets it gets it uh first one's playstation okay the code's kind of skewed there but you can figure it out um xbox [Music] and pc standard edition oh it's dome i've not played this all night this is an old map vanguard pc standard edition there you go let me know if you're gone okay right this will be the last game on multiplayer i think maybe we could try zombies do you guys want me to try zombies after this or should i do that tomorrow or something come on this is a cool map i like this map hylo is the k man like it's actually working no i don't feel like it was working before tell you what i'm going to stream this tomorrow and i'm going to start by using these uh hollow point rounds and it's it's going to be great i mean i've had a lot of fun tonight to be fair it's just i think there's clearly ways to build the guns that are just so much better like the amount of people i'm beating now in firefights that i just wasn't before i should have started playing this a couple days ago but i just did campaign and then didn't really try this last couple days [Applause] from i have to say though from a mechanic standpoint i enjoy this way better than black ops cold war yeah no way i could do that with those old knights you can get a 30 round version of these mags as well will there be more codes i'll try and get some more for tomorrow uh deuce thank you for the two you got the xbox code good lad i mean one of the most off-putting things so far though is the lack of footsteps like from a client-side perspective and also server-side perspective it's a great map the sky i've got pizza jack keep the stream going with zombies so i can watch good food lucy thank you man it's very kind dude what kind of pizza you got i do kind of want a pizza now though but a bit late isn't it nearly midnight it's not yeah this is a cod world war marker it runs really smooth as well look at that glide bomb in there oh no i'm ruined high alert wasn't working at all in that pre-pro match was it one shot we got the kill that would be a good kill game for that guy i've nearly maxed out the stg as well which i'm quite happy about dude get off that head glitch come on banana who's looking at me then i guess you can have late night pizza you can yeah but it's not it doesn't sit well on the stomach does it you eat right before bed oh look at the damage there come on that's ridiculous i should not have killed that man okay i have to admit i'm kind of getting into this now i didn't think i'd like it as much as this but i think it's quite good it's it's a lot better than cold water where's the sound gone cause i stunned then i was like that was okay never too late for pizza maybe a right craig well craig became a member thank you sorry chris said that i lost i'm someone disappointed you'll do better next time i'm eating a big mac that's master i'm jealous dude i gotta play the game what did i do i mean was it worth it i don't think it was worth it [Music] most multi kills come on come on lads you know you want to vote for me right you know we want to vote come on come on one more one more one no no no ridiculous [Music] uh daniel thanks for the five have i ever thought of a collab with tim does that man i'd love to again don't know the guy let's do like um let's do a few rounds of zombies slippery thank you for the five yeah that was a fun game i enjoyed that i suppose you can level guns up in zombies as well right 45 minutes mg42 level one have i got the ppship this is nuts by the way if you go in a private game with a friend all the guns are unlocked you can pick this and you can dig it out and then you can put the health on 250 which is what warzone is and it absolutely shreds like it is this thing is broken in war zone if they keep it like this trust me i mean uh benny central we're testing it it's just it's gonna be busted so do solo you can't reload console in zombies really tim's hilarious man like he uh he's just such a good natural entertainer whatever he's talking about it's funny i don't know like how he does it but he's he's just naturally entertaining and funny naturally funny naturally entertaining [Music] so you don't start with any hearts defeat what lies beyond these portals to win corrupted hearts any switch codes no i don't switch andrea sir it's time to feed i like watching him he does like tick-tock reviews of food [Music] a bullet for your thoughts conrad those uh tick-tock videos are ridiculous by the way obviously bait as well you guys know what i'm talking about where someone will make they'll [__] they'll be like okay this is my favorite meal to cook at home and it's like the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen in your life or the most insane way to make a lasagna or whatever it might be and it it's it's egregious like it just doesn't make any sense the way that they do it and it's just clickbait it's it's rage content or outrage content like to call it where you just make something so ridiculous that the average user on tick tock or instagram or youtube or wherever you put it can't help but comment and go are you stupid like this is so stupid i can't believe you're this stone and like they're the ones getting they're the ones getting trolled there's one i've seen where this woman makes iced tea you seen that one and she puts like an entire bowl of sugar in and it's obviously a troll but the average user on tick tock can't help it they have to comment and the thing is the way that algorithms are made nowadays for youtube tick tock instagram twitter the more engagement you get the more views the thing gets because it gets boosted by the algorithms that were in place to show people the content because a video or piece of content that people engage with and has adverts on he seems to be way more valuable than something that doesn't have engagement so all you have to do is make something or say something that gets people to talk and then that's how your video gets seen so it encourages content creators to make things that are ridiculous because that's the way the algorithms are geared [Applause] so all those videos that you see on tick tock which are like here's my favorite iced tea or whatever it is here's how i make lasagna he is uh a steak with tweet like twinkie sauce i don't know again it's all designed to just make people annoyed and comment that is it keep that in mind when you watch youtube videos and streams if someone says something dumb maybe maybe it's because they're just being sincere or they're ignorant or whatever it is but most of the time they've said it on purpose just to annoy you or to get you to comment stolen people talk a lot in zombies don't they didn't know how empty i felt until i was restored outrage content i call it if no one's calling that phrase they should i don't want credit it's fine someone's already come up with that surely certainly in this together my friends onto the next blockage great things did i get enough to pack a punch mean it can be entertaining though that kind of content just because it's so ridiculous right like it's just so obscene but it's funny the more ridiculous the better that's the way algorithms drive content this is zombie spill yeah this is what it's like follows that floating orb it seeks a floor it's a barrier spent even youtube's become like that yeah it's kind of sad because like i said this earlier your title and your thumbnail is like 99 of being a successful youtuber obviously there's a lot of skill in crafting a video that people want to watch that's interesting and engaging and has a bit of mystique to it or an interesting topic there is a bit of skill to that but if you can't get someone to click on that in the first place then you've you've lost the game right you have to play the game you have to make a title that's interesting not clickbait but interesting and mysterious enough that doesn't give away the video you have to get people to watch the video and you do that with a good tile a good thumbnail and an interesting hook at the start if you can do that then your video will be seen but it is kind of sad in a way because let's say um you make the best video about whatever topic whatever topic you want let's say you were doing a a video essay on the football appellate and you have made the best video ever hypothetically speaking it is the best most engaging interesting video ever made on youtube you don't have a good title of thumbnail for that video no one's gonna see it and that's kind of sad but i understand why it's like that because there are so many people on youtube now making content that it's so saturated and if every video was you can't show every video to everyone because people are subscribed to hundreds of channels i mean i'm subscribed to like 70 people and if i like ding the bell on every person that i'm subscribed to my youtube app on my phone would just be spammed all the time and it would suck so i understand why algorithms are in place but it is a bit sad that that's the way things have gone i understand why but don't hate the player hate the game let's go give court effects it destroys creativity in a way faizal yeah it does there's always going to be channels out there though that have a lot of viewers and subscribers and are creative and just make what they want they won't necessarily be the most popular or successful or profitable if that's what you want it's really it's really interesting it's really it's a really interesting topic i could talk about it for hours but i'm sure you guys get bored i suppose if you were a content creator who didn't let's say didn't particularly care about putting out stuff that you thought was quality um or even if you were someone who whose videos were always good sometimes you might doubt the amount of time you have to spend on something because you could make a video that was put together in an hour and because of the topic of that video or the title of the thumbnail that video might pop off and then the next week you might put together a video that takes you eight hours to make and you really care about it but because the topic isn't as controversial or interesting you know that video might not perform as well and therefore it might not make as much money it might not get you new subscribers but then what you're going to be more inclined to do if you just care about the cash you're just going to make more videos that are controversial or negative or not particularly high effort because that's the way the algorithms are set up now shane thank you for becoming a member uh hakandar as well thank you for the 17 months change actually 33 months shane you must be one of my longest standing members there buddy thank you only my undying hatred what game is my youtube banner based on it's a mix of warzone and battlefield maybe a video about youtube optimization would be cool yeah it's it's shockingly easy to manipulate people on the internet i'll say that and there there are there are lots of ways in which you can again like we were just talking about with tick tock there are lots of ways in which you can incentivize or get someone to write a comment and it just it doesn't always have to be malicious but there are a lot of tactics you can use in a video to get people to leave a comment or like a video or whatever [Music] you can you know you can write an entire book about it on social media in particular like twitter it's so e you can predict you can make a a tweet and predict easily what someone's going to say within the next five minutes the kind of reply someone's gonna make ah keep coming you undead nazi dogs always i've done that one haven't i transmitted i've done that one [Music] of your demon's power fight hard human i really need this a sound's missing from the game i think there's a bit of ambiance missing really cat dad i feel like it could do with a bit of ambiance yeah will you play 2042 early on xbox jack or will you wait for pc i'll wait for pc dude filled with power stolen from your demons i'll wait for pc with us i think you can play it um if you have xbox you can change your region to new zealand and if you've got early access to the game you can play it on i think it's 11 am gmt on thursday so it's whenever it's midnight in new zealand so it's the 12th you can't do that on playstation or pc though a bullet for your thoughts i'm bullied for your thoughts from that [Music] this is a good way to level up weapons you think i think multiplayer will be quicker though wouldn't it [Applause] i love how smooth this game runs feels really nice you have to collect these five runes and then deposit them in here i think it would still be faster to level up weapons on multiplayer though but i don't know if this zombies would be as fast as horrible zombies because in this zombies there's a lot of like waiting around and teleporting unless i mean i guess i could just stay in this bit and just not not put the runes in right so you could just have infinite zombies what level was that is [Music] i mean it's right there someone did not get enough affection as a child oh no all zombies they're just undead they don't know what they are anymore hey don from florida how you doing do you think it's easier to make it on youtube now when it was before with things like apps we're sorry with apps like tick tock and channels blowing up overnight um there's a lot more opportunities and avenues to grow an audience nowadays i would say and it used to be for sure yeah you just have to play the game you have to look at what's being pushed and use it a lot don't stop now but uh if you must retreat there is now a way to fix it but it did not seem like you were using that face i nearly killed me are you gonna leave at level five said can transform trash into treasure get busy my friend let's turn the hearts there is nothing i would not give for vengeance blitz what's you came a blitz way just to die james don't act like you're already s triple nine on 2042. i will crush you with sheer numbers i just have to survive this one [Music] the professor's degenerate harm [Applause] i never turn down something useful what's it called [Applause] i have no idea what's going on we're just playing zombies dude so the zombies in this is a bit different to the cordless zombies and there's a hub area and then you teleport to different objectives it's um it's simplified sorry it's a massive simplification over horrible zombies um i think cold war zombies is a lot better than this like there's not enough variety in the levels that you go to there's not enough variety in the enemies that you fight the easter egg isn't live yet so there isn't a easter egg quest yet or anything like that i mean it's um it's all right enough just to run around and level up some guns but yeah i think like black ops cold war zombies was a lot better than this you just go back to the same places over and over again it's quite restrictive the most satisfying feeling in the world looks good though feels good they just need more depth there's barely any upgrades either not much exploration or mystery in the level compared to black ops [Applause] there we go so we just completed that we're going to be teleported back effects must rest for now but i will have i said they're gonna update it but there will be more zombies content i just don't know when i feel like it's gonna be three or four months before there's any new zombie stuff which is a shame roxanne when am i thinking about streaming you mean tomorrow it'll be the same kind of time like 8pm probably 8pm uk time or maybe a bit earlier because it's sunday just depends if i if i can get everything done i've got a place somewhere album ring tomorrow and um did you get the attention you wanted so this is the hub area you always come back here what is it that's the one i will accept your offer yeah i think it was bugged god effect steals our power what's up johnny take it back yes i said play elder ring i've got access to alvin ring cozy i've been playing it last couple days craven we're here from the future in australia jack it's already sunday there you go you're living the dream i can't say dead meat i can only say that i've played it in my crosshairs sorry i'm bored i've been threatened by that now get those runes up i'm starving hello federico you're drunk cool good for you you don't deserve my mercy okay i'm gonna go fine keep feeding try it again oh [Applause] [__] monkey bomb [Music] what [Music] nine thank you for the 10 long time fan and follow mr frags appreciate your work looking forward to 2042 would love to see a jack frag start to disrespect collab in the future did you get the attention you wanted one shots one this is pretty much uh zombies that's why it's uh it's a bit of a letdown for me in uh in this game quite basic thank you frederica what's up tyler is that paulina yeah i play les paulina laura we need our symbiotic spirits at full strength they give you so much ammo yeah yeah what size pc monitor 27 i've got the hp omen x 27 40p 240 hertz very good [Applause] hotel i mean oh like you can explore and you can find uh you came a long way there's one there there's not really any bosses either which is a shame maybe that will be when the easter eggs out meet face face meet bullet you are fools to do craft speeding but once you are dead you will enter my commands it's still quite satisfying though i think that's because of the mechanics there professor it is time i don't want to since we can't contact you and maybe i don't know though i think perhaps on thursday you can play it so these are like demons that follow the story keep talking to you and they never stop talking and never ever stop talking keep talking forever i can't say um hillary no opinions or anything i can just say i'm playing it you don't deserve my mercy this level's in the single player it's a really cool part went the wrong way [Applause] make them very good very good come on move on mate what's the actual objectives just survive there isn't like i said the easter egg isn't in yet so there's not really a deeper story or anything any crashing i haven't crashed once reflex it's run really well for me soon what did you ask grayson sorry i missed it i suppose it already does why can you not say if you like it alaric it's because i signed a an embargo a contract you know that's typically the way the way it works like in the gaming industry sometimes you know they might give you early access to a game but um you can say you you're playing it but there'll be an embargo on impressions it's just like a review embargo that's all it's quite normal in you know all sorts of media in industries that kind of thing look at me again [__] oh wait you can't i'm gonna do the exhale and then we'll finish up it's been a fun stream tonight guys i've enjoyed it thank you for coming along got some good levels done on the vanguard guns we'll be live again tomorrow with vanguard [Applause] same kind of time do you want to tune in for that oh this exhale sequence is a bit underwhelming as well [Applause] try again again the ball's up there that's a new one into the portal okay you have to hold f on it you made it now shelter in that portal until we fight again not zombies you should have known i would end up on top [Music] yeah it needs a lot more depth through that way more depth i hope they update it a lot um right guys thanks again for watching good fun great chat as well tonight thank you cheers for all the donors new members appreciate that big thanks to activision as well for sponsoring the stream today if you enjoyed it guys leave a like subscribe if you're new take care of yourselves take care of
