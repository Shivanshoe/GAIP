hi everyone and welcome to call of duty vanguard today we're going to be playing multiplayer i'm part of an event an early access event big thanks to activision for letting me get involved with this as well and we're just going to be playing the i think this is the beta build of the game and there's a variety of different maps and game modes that we're going to be exploring i'm looking forward to it so welcome if you're joining it live appreciate you guys for being here thank you if you're watching this as a vod after the fact appreciate you guys too and if you enjoy the live stream or the vod make sure you hit that thumbs up button below thank you very much and leave a comment so i've got a few loadouts here a few basic loadouts now this looks familiar to you it's because this is on the modern warfare engine so a lot of the systems that are in that game are the same in this game for example all the loadouts right we've got gunsmith now i've played this a little bit i played it for a couple hours about a week ago so i've only got a few things unlocked here but you can have 10 attachments on the stg which is pretty pretty nuts i've unlocked the silencer compensator but you can see all the end level unlocks there different optics i'm sure that anyone who is a historic buff and knows all about world war ii will cringe at some of these uh some of these attachments but it's a video game it is what it is um here's a look at some of the new perks as well so ghost undetectable while moving by spy planes enemy intel and field mics reduces effectiveness of local informants so i think you're only if you've got ghosts equipped you're only off the radar if you're moving if you stand still and you've got ghost i think you're still going to be on the radar which is an interesting change uh this this uh perk here i feel like everyone's just gonna pick this and this is basically turning it into the old call of duty mini-map radar enemies appear on your mini-map when they fire an unsilenced weapon yeah that's a pretty big deal i think a lot of people are going to take that i also got double time there as well pretty much the same as mw tacticians restock overkill let you take two primary weapons you guys know what this is come on if you play warzone or cod especially nw19 you'll recognize all this stuff but we are just waiting in discord at the moment because we have to queue up for specific playlists so i'm in a secret secret discord and they're going to give us instructions on what to cue we've got several different game modes here i think we're going through it in this order as well so we've got tactical patrol on guvutu tdm on hotel royale that's a crazy map that is red star is stalingrad snow sniper rifles that kind of thing long lines of sight then kill confirmed on eagle's nest eagle's nest is very typical cod map three lanes but you've also got a bit of destruction in there too oh maybe opens up the map a bit too much based on my experience so far and then we've got blitz which is just i think that's 20 players on these maps so it's just chaos i don't know if i don't know how much i'm going to enjoy these but these are all 6v6 here um i can take a look at some of the different weapons for you so in the smg class in the beta release i assume there's going to be way more weapons in the full game but these are the three smgs we've got the thompson the stan or the mp40 mp4 is really good assault rifles scg ultra burst there was a weapon very similar to that in bf5 what was it called the emera or something got the bar the nz 41 that's weird it looks like a hybrid tommy gun or something then the valk that's in bf5 as well that was called the sturm get there i think but it looks like we're searching for a game now just been given the command so we'll jump in this one we're going for first yeah just double check now this is going to be very sweaty i have to warn you guys i don't know if i'm going to completely try hard but it's just european content creators and some press as well so it's going to be quite competitive matches hey geeky do you want to see kill streaks yeah i can show you kill streaks intel care package spy plane uav counter spy plane glide bomb death machine mortar barrage war machine flame gnaw and attack dogs there you go stone conveyor one five yeah that's the one uh kiss the crook thank you for the ten honestly looking forward to this looks way better than cold whatever we did i hope you're having a good week and we're all hyped to see some 2042 content from you in the future me too crook me too okay here we go first match have i got everything set up i don't know we're just gonna go for it yolo the new map for war zone has been revealed is that true yes they'd like life i can't yeah sorry about that guys i i mean that's uh some loud people they were just shouting straight away um so this is like a moving domination point isn't it patrol i think i've got stuns and i've got grenades you can also slide as well just like in mw and warzo i feel like we're gonna get hammered we're losing already i don't like that sunflower there that's friendly oh nice shot sprat oh baby just went for a double there that was good there's a bit of um destruction as well i'll try and show you guys like um hopefully i can demonstrate some of the uh features of the game here as well like there's like blind fire cover too i mean that is really difficult to see over there yeah one thing that i've noticed as well like i said to you guys i did play this about a week ago for a couple hours the footsteps sounds are inaudible like i i can't really hear them that well and uh like i think it's a big problem for me to be honest hold on to it obviously it's a beta you know they'll be looking at changing things here and there but like the game itself is just really really quiet footsteps in particular look at this as well you get a an arc on your grenades now you see this like when i want to throw a stun you see that line that's telling me that's telling me where the grenades are gonna go i wonder if they're gonna put that in the warzone throwing grenades trying to make sure grenades super easy though doesn't it double kill i definitely dumb it down a bit that's not a door that i can go through maybe i should try and play the objective how about that uh graphic settings most i think it's maxed out like it's mostly on there on high graphics grenade up here in the air spies in the sky we got an empty control zone revenge is sweet revenge is sweet yeah i think i'm playing as the russian sniper enemy care package inbound nice shot uh so you can slide you can do tax sprint you know just like in warzone and modern warfare a small vengeance double kill the gunplay looks satisfying i mean it feels like modern warfare we're in the lead i should have peaked after the stun grenade arc is due to the perk demolition oh you might be right actually yeah i'll have to check that we got eyes yeah i'm sure that we'll see a lot of these perks come to warzone as well you can like watch this watch this i'm the incredible hulk how about that you can just run through the barricades i am a normal human remember a normal human being kobe get on this point that's it for the intel so i can hear like friendly footsteps quite easily that's a problem when you play the objective of this game in this game mode people know where you are you can always prefer them like that yeah we playing on pc i know a lot of people are asking in the chat this is on pc i'm running a 30-90 uh pretty much maxed out as i mentioned oh shot in the back they have the patrol zone he's drop shotting a thing ah there's a bit of a hostile record in the air spies in the sky not really there's a bit of a delay blind fire here i'm trying to show you see this watch blind fire i mean you could be quite accurate with that look at that if you if you made like a hip fire build or something right you can also move left and right when you're mounted as well i'm mounted right now patrol zones up for grabs recon airborne eyes up this guy's sneaky one oh i heard footsteps i actually heard footsteps how long will i be streaming lizelle couple hours yeah i'll be on for a couple hours like i said there's a there's a whole host of maps and game modes that we'll be playing i mean that that sound is straight out of counter strike it's squeaky door on nuke yeah i'm gonna go play the objective now sorry i'm trying to pay attention to the chat and play the game at the same time lead is lost more difficult than you think you know control zone secured yeah i'll be um i'll be sniping on some of the other maps oh come on how did i not get that one can you destroy this stuff oh yeah some of it [Music] grabbing supplies he's he's the australian dude right i think he's australian hostile recon in the air spies in the sky bro bro that's better there's a guy up here took the patrol zone can i get up here this way i can there's a guy right here try and do an execution oh that was sick what the hell that was actually sick i enjoyed that yeah so executions are back introduced in uh bottom warfare 19. are the guns similar to cod world war two no they feel like modern warfare 2019. i think my grenade hit that dude fob siding yeah on pc i don't think there's an fov slider on console though oh what a spawn hold on to difficult to get kill streaks is that a bar so i try that someone's uh built a bar here it's a nice looking model that to be there oh that sounds good really slow rate of fire though are there remotes uh i don't think so copy i climbed that i don't think so we are just winning as well not by much though it's close game that dude just got sniped what goes around comes around these landing craft can i use that like oh there's no i thought there was a gun on there where that need come from [Applause] took control zone is get some days back and then we'll push the point [Music] they have the advantage you intel ready for report oh that felt good hashtag not my battlefield hey master yeah this is a pc playing this on pc i think i'm playing cosplay with like other people as well though oh we lost no four points in it back stronger [Music] oh that was i saw spratt do that right at the start that was nice oh hit them quick scopes not bad first game in the back okay right i think we gotta back out now and search for something else you're in a game with one of the biggest streamers of germany lol maybe that's the guy that said something at the start i don't know okay when you're done search for tactical team deathmatch hotel royale let's go what's the fps uh this feels really good uh i'll show you when i'm in-game [Music] it's 60 on the menu because it's limited to 60. i mean if i'm i reckon maybe 180 to 200 something like that all right mp4 160 180 200 and then off camera let's go all right mp40 this time i've got attack dogs as well i think it's a 10 kill streak use all your senses yeah there's a lot of destruction on this map see all this stuff here you can destroy that all those little tiles there that really opens up the lines of sight on the whole yes why can't you just accept me for who i am on the hulk i mean i was trying to smash through the wall i wonder if that kills you if you're on the other side rainbow six siege that site is really shiny maybe i should take that off we have the lead keep it up i don't see anyone can i go up here oh look at that oh that's cheeky fight back cheeky little route there there's an elevator here i can drop down i'm gonna spawn over here i think okay i can hear footsteps now but i'm not sure if it's above or below me [Applause] we're falling behind i'm not gonna challenge that again we took the advantage ah fair play that's a nice bit of geometry there isn't it can i do a i can't do a mount here i want to do a mount double kill let's get that reload off is that the eiffel tower what bloody hell is that doing there i didn't say that was allowed i kind of like that takes a bit of the rng out of the grenade but it also you know means it's not a skillful to throw grenades anymore you can see exactly where they're going there's a um encounter strike go when you watch a demo back or if you put sp cheats on if you're running your own server you can actually see the arc of the grenade and it's a really good way of learning like smoke grenades and stuff like that ah gotta put that suppressor on i think we're up on a roof aren't we is that the send there i'm out here sightseeing while everyone's just killing each other get that new kid i don't even know if nukes are in the game there's no there's no way anyone is getting a nuke in these lobbies by the way let me tell you that for a fact look the wrong way this is where the actions are make you intel beans for report triple kill why is that guy called baked beans not that there's anything wrong with baked beans of course there's nothing wrong with baked beans i'll try this out then pop the uav what the hell what the hell hey i just killed baked beans i know the americans don't like the baked beans today i'll tell you bake beans on toast with cheese beautiful love it bunny hop jack what do you mean you can't really you can't really bunny hop it just slows you down see you just kind of get a uh this game looks exactly like cold war i can tell you it doesn't look like cold war to me and it doesn't feel anything like cold war i mean the fact that it's on the uh mw engine look at that not that that's uh impressive or anything but it's cooler you can do that it doesn't feel anything like cold war to me this feels exactly like mw but a slower rate of fire guns i've got play of the game let's go now it's quite a balanced game that one yeah dude baked beans on toast rob i'm telling you man baked beans on toast with cheddar cheese on top delicious a lot of people just never tried it and they look at it and go that's disgusting i would never but you try and you're like you know what those flavors actually they work really well together that's uh that's working for me okay what's next please continue searching tactical team deathmatch hotel royale when your match ends so i think we might be playing that one again i look at the weapon builds actually um what did i get for my mp4 firefighter stabilizer i don't think a big scope would work well on the mp4 i should just take it off here rear grip oh got a rear grip now stipple grip i mean that's the same as uh mw in it no mag yet fred grenade a gammon bomb that's an impact grenade molotov demo charge c4 c4 isn't it secondaries if i got a rat solo call of duty players shotguns revolving shotgun autoloading shotgun mg42 oh why not dp-27 bren a lot of these guns are in bfi aren't they i mean it is based on world war ii so m1 garand i bet that's trash in multiplayer sniper rifles car 98 i have to be level 26 to get the car 98 are you kidding me are you kidding me can you look at the challenges for the weapon cameras um no i don't think they're here unless we've got access to the barracks that's all we've got play weapons and store that's it i didn't look at these uh darth lord thank you for the five first time catching live love you dog how does the recall feel i mean there's not much at all to be honest juju it's it's not difficult for me to control it on house and keyboard is that dead silence ah no no no failed my goliath oh my god that's that remote control bomb thing that's a real thing by the way this was a real thing in world war two it's the world war two rc xd armor plates oh okay well that's gonna be quite sought after isn't it i kind of want to try that just to say this is a war machine that's been in cod before hasn't it flame not that's like a juggernaut suit with a flamethrower and you get some doggos what kind of dogs are they are they dobermans is that right [Music] is it dopamine i mean i'm not really great with i know some dog breeds but [Music] is that hound i don't know i can't i can't remember what they're called they're the resident evil dog aren't they i'm sure they're adorable they just get a bad rep because of call of duty that's not true that's a joke countless by playing uh i'll go for that as my first one instead go for four kills see if i can make a a sniper loadout maybe lone wolf flash hider optic so that has a sniper scope on it by default by the looks of it what's the longest one you can get three point two five three two six three point five eight times looks like eight times is the longest one [Music] i mean every i just want radar that's all i want yeah you're right about demolition whoever said that in the chat so if you want to see the arc of the grenade you have to take the demolition part that's really good though when does it release november releases in november huh [Music] machine pistol go with that let me just check the discord and see what we're supposed to be searching okay so it's that again but i'll be joining mid match here that's fine is there specialist score streaks not in this build no i don't know if that's going to be in the full game though do i know when the battlefield 2042 beta starts september there's an stg blueprint really i don't see one ater okay oh my god what the hell that's crazy that looks like a tommy gun mixed with an sdg proficiency vital that's a gun perk then there right i must be that's interesting i want to use my sniper rifle okay right okay so we're searching for a different one now red star next red star so this is the uh stalingrad map longer sidelines is it fov on pc yeah there is field of view i'm using 100. doberman that's the name of the dogs that's it it's a doberman good job can you shoot when you're running um not when you attack sprint when's the open beta i think it's this weekend for pc no this weekend for ps5 and ps4 and then next weekend it's uh pc and xbox and playstation show settings i mean it's it's modern warfare guys like it's if you want to see the settings just load at modern warfare there you go i don't think they've really added anything new here in terms of settings i think the single player graphics are better than mw though but multiplayer i don't know i think it's a close one okay here we go yeah so this is a much bigger map this one yeah i need to look at the new warzone maps on if that's true if what you're telling me is true that's really interesting is it is it theme to world war two is it like the pacific or the eastern front like what's western front is it a mix what's it look like domination take the objective stay critical of your opponents and yourself capturing able we're dug in at able all right so where they're gonna be keep it up this is full enemy at the gates right here oh man that ads time is so slow damn they're taking baker that's awful nice kill grenade it's pacific okay cool look at this this little doll it's adorable they're taking baker and this guy's afk losing objective baking i can go up here baker [Music] i don't think anyone would ever say that ever you know capturing faker hey what's up cameron you want to take the supplies [Music] that was a one-hit kill why was that one hit kill i'll care package okay i'm dead oh you get no ammo in that thing what the hell it's burst beat the door yeah that's my warfare um recon airborne eyes up good job i want this care package just to see what i get i want to do it by my team though because someone's going to kill me a nicket put it here i'd like charlie is it coming on a plane hey that's my care package not yours ah please you're kidding me that's the most boring thing in the end objective able [Music] losing objective able we took the advantage it's hard being a sniper out here you know they're taking life flanked here i would like to see the baby goodbye oh that's the best night problem abel is lost securing bacon oh i could go up here i can be jude law where is rachel vice man the visibility like there's a weird blurriness in this game that i don't like like they're taking charlie i don't know whether it's the weather effects or just like the way it's being rendered but it's just a weird blurriness in the background i mean you got to give me something to shoot here guys come on curing able losing objective baker i don't see anyone all objectives secure dig in they're taking baker baker is overrun taking baker that's not a that's not a kill okay don't die don't die package stopped and ready losing objective able have i got the field upgrade yeah i do they're taking able all right here we go world war ii let's go okay i just got to find a target oh it's so slow it's so slow i've got to find it's our target and detonate don't you dare shoot me look i'm friendly i'm friendly no no it's just wally i'm just a disney movie it's just disney it's disney then i'm really out of fuel hostile recon in the air flies in the sky goliath detonated i don't know how i feel about that guys i feel like i've been done there you know [Music] losing objective charlie dude just looking good for us mortar barrage yes i like the sound of that what during baker i have a better target that looks like a mine at closing with abel they're driving us back is it a marker with charlie we hold charlie i don't know i don't know how that works to be honest record in the air spies in the start i'm just gonna test it what did it what it didn't work okay i've still got it in my inventory it's gone now it's gone i literally can't select it my killstreak's broken i hate that i can't use my field upgrade either rip it's that old bug isn't it from uh warzone it's back voldemort's back i might have to die what if i die losing objective charlie taking able don't kill me please don't kill me god in the air spies in the sky that doesn't work taking baker we have total domination hold the line oh my god rip the rest in peace department that was an awful movie wasn't it like really bad losing objective able okay as bad as it gets yeah i must have gone upstairs they're taking baker abel is overrun was it ryan reynolds and jeff bridges right it wasn't it baker is lost i'd like to i'd like to kill someone with this imagine if you die to that you'd be so annoyed weren't you you'd actually be so annoyed you got killed by blind fire record in the air can i use my i can use my stuff i can use my stuff but i can't use my six no it's gone again no securing able they're taking i can't use it again guys nice shot the low health breathing sounds like the juggernaut suit yeah a little bit the enemy has total domination total domination i'd like a bit more gore you know can you blind fire the sniper closing with abel you actually can okay cannot call a motor strike undercover right i just want to see what this i see it's like a big it's just going to shell the crap out of that then yeah it's a bit underwhelming to be honest charge i'll just kill myself with it as well script 10 out of 10 would recommend i generated that 10 out of 10. they just sent me an email and said you know what we're going to give this game a 10. all objectives well now we know you can kill yourself hold on to it hostile record in the air i'm gonna put wally now again oh here we go wally's back let's go wally what's up what's up yes that was almost like it was scripted or something that's great charlie right on cue capturing baker out don't chase me don't don't chase me okay chase me chase me chase me let's go i don't want to okay okay no problem they're taking baker that's a mess oh we won getting in ah you lads are all right all right who's the lovely bastard that trained you it was me it was captain price actually but i like to say it was me a sprout again with the place look at this oh beautiful great game 10 out of 10 would recommend i mean we experimented with a few things there we found a few bugs you know experienced enemy at the gates and now we're playing eagles nest a playlist update the game isn't even out yet what what tactical kill confirmed when your current match completes a player this update will be pushed once you see that message search tactical kill confirmed eagles nest [Music] you need to get a history channel stamp for the corner of this stream i don't think the history channel would improve of this uh tyler thank you for becoming a member uh riot thank you for the five that's very kind of you uh yeah if you guys become members you get access to a uh discord server nice little community on there if any of you are interested in that and you get some cool emotes that you can use in chat if you care about [Music] what's up equivalent dub duplex you how you going jess matthias use the launcher you want to try the launcher i mean it could be good on this map could do a meme load out maybe um i don't have any of them unlocked though guys i'm sorry i i failed you what should i use mg42 kill confirm take out all enemies hope you like a little challenge i mean that sounds all right are you just to run down there i'd be so annoyed if i get killed by this it was literally a guy here prone keep it ciao i'm sorry ciao i don't know who you are but i'm sorry that must have uh that must have stoned that one you go inside oh watch the bird watch oh yeah yeah yeah yeah get some of that get some of that do you think i gave the game away there for my team the eagles nest isn't this like one of um wasn't this this one of germany's last like strong points up in the was it in the swiss was it up in the alps i didn't pay attention in history class guys i'm very sorry mg42 i can shoot all these out it's kind of like i don't know it just kind of feels pointless though like what's the point of being able to do that yeah you open up a line of sight here if you're camping i suppose if there's a domination point destroy some of those tables as well chad wasn't happy with me i'm sorry i'm just trying to test the game and see what happens given that game ice breaker she used to play when you were a kid that game was sick to be there right yes i am an enemy sorry i'm just doing some myth busting here it was the penthouse there you go yeah that kind of destroyed there as well when there were only so many left icebreakers was great man i used to love that oh don't let go mouse one just keep choosing the americans took it didn't they it's not dead yeah it had the little hammers yeah intron that's it you remember [Applause] i'm it throw it again guys i'm gonna be that cod player recon oh no i'll be on that map now guys please just let me oh wow look at this i've got some plans here got some boots what is that i don't know what that is it's a clock guys you know from one from the back some kind of time travel device maybe from the front it's just a clock who's that as well all these statues not the best abs time on this mg42 but it is kind of ridiculous that you can just run around with an abs but you know god's always been like that with big light machine guns hasn't it oh i love that so we count how many seconds it takes to reload one two three four five six six and a half second reload a care package i mean there's no way i'm gonna get it here why should i put the care package somewhere secret and safe all the way back here maybe it's a secret care package for me just for me where's the plane now where's the plane up i don't see it there it is give it to me here she comes here she comes oh it bounces a lot no no i didn't get it it's gonna be stolen it's stealing it no all right i'm going to get revenge it's wally time jesus i mean if it turns upside down it just explodes by itself not sure about that recon airborne eyes up double kill this mg42 is safe this mg42 is actually safe i don't think it should be that good i can't believe they stole it i was denied a stunner do you think they ran around saying that in world war ii to each other throwing a stunner i didn't have stun grenades in world war two really did they i think they had flashbangs right or some you know basic primitive form of a flashbang like oh look at this [Applause] can i rappel down there that'd be good um i'll try shotgun maybe [Applause] mayhem why is that called mayhem shotgun revolving shotgun autoloading shotgun try that out maybe i don't have anything to lock for it of course radar goes i was not killed then please wally please what would you do if you saw this in real life what would you do please it won't let me go triple kill let's go that must have gone through the wall then i was only expecting one kill there oh god not at range not like this is that that's landed right next to me i didn't go over the cover you reckon i could blind fire someone should we test it out i stay here i've got to listen out for someone running towards me hopefully they don't come behind me they'll see me on the mini-map won't they because i'm not moving cause i yeah it's really difficult to guess [Music] there's a bit of a buzz on their mind is that it shouldn't be a buzz on them shout out to stone why stone mountain yeah always who's a legend uh okay that's awful that's awful [Applause] who needs killing what the hell i blew the door open oh excuse me you can fire it that fast i didn't realize that okay well that changes the gun got him on their heels hello oh my god what the hell i didn't realize you could fire that quick that's hilarious dude that just absolutely minces people use the other shotgun i think we're about to uh about the winner bang you did it don't celebrate too hard am i gonna get played again oh no i thought the the wally might be playing the game did you do it hotel royale hotel royale okay this is this is where it gets crazy it's where it gets really really crazy i'll try the other shotgun because someone in chat asked mayhem revolving shotgun i'm going to put the full joke on the compensator and the optic the sun filter no i don't want that i mean i've got nothing guys what do you want from me wrapped up i want the bazooka it's locked ruined so try the old um the gammon bomb try that out gas [Music] 12 versus 12 or i don't know man hunter that's uh grand smg stand all the stand i forgot i was in the game i did actually show that earlier didn't i come on four more players let's go what's up uh unwise fusion how you doing eyes of buys what's up hello rogue gaming i've not unlocked the car 98 yet top frag so i can't show you how can i play this beta is on the weekend on playstation engine is the same as modern warfare taffy it's exactly the same engine upgraded a little bit i do have to try the correct the grando just to see if it does the ping you need to get the good rant you need to see if it pings oh i love the sound of the ping what are you doing it honestly feels like three months since cold war came out i mean it's nearly a year isn't it hello callum have they got fish ai probably yeah tom probably yeah west has been in all my games chris it's broken in the chat what's up broken how are you doing can you increase the rate of fire of the mg-42 i've got no idea i imagine so because there's like 10 attachments for each gun so you're new to the channel what's the phase and thank you for coming hey tactical tourbis how you doing man finding the crabs in battlefield 5. uh gajira thank you for the five i love your content what's up man thank you wes yeah west has been in all the games he's been in all of them but it's fine i think we've been on the same team as well what was that little robot tank thinking that's world war two wally mate it's uh rcxd but really really slow but a massive blast radius uh we have a new member as well thank you uh aaron thank you so much if you want to get on the discord go to jackfrags.com discord and there's instructions there michael thanks for the 10. love you from the tbm crew thank you man can you show the fps in the settings that's a good point um text chat fps counter yeah you can all that stuff i will say which is quite disappointing um it's got streamer mode i mean i know this doesn't apply to like 99 but the streaming mode is the same as in modern warfare and warzone at the moment so it just randomizes names on your client so really it doesn't it it's not a streamer mode like it doesn't really work uh toledo thanks for the two do i have to buy the game to play it this weekend i don't think so yeed i think you can just get it if you got ps5 i was going to try i was going to try this revolving shotgun just because it looks cool a 12v12 how quick does it fire you'll confirm oh damn eliminate all hostiles this will be intense i hope you came prepared oh you came prepared weird captain price from the world war two times it's a gammon bomb it's an impact grenade i forgot oh my god a shotgun there versus three people with smg's no i didn't have a chance [Applause] i feel like i need to stick in this bit here if i'm gonna use a shotgun how's it running yeah i mean you can see the fps there and it's on left yeah i feel like this gun this gun isn't great especially low level i don't know you watch it be the most overpowered thing in the game when it releases there'll be one attachment you can get for it that's just insane reload it takes like 50 years to reload a few moments later stun grenade oh my oh my molotov that's the first time i've seen that oh it's a morse code machine i know what that is okay goliath is available guys here we go oh that's an enemy please okay can i still use it yeah no no no space why if i go stand in the bathroom yes world war ii wall is coming through oh excuse me aircraft goliath detonated hostile record in the air spies in the sky how was that not a kill stained parabellum try that it's cool looking stand that good model you know recon sweep in the sector don't run there you you're dead child come sorry i'll tell you what though the thompson sounds good i can't see anything guys i'm sorry i don't know what day it is oh in the back um right someone wanted to see the grand in there i have the grinder quick no i have to put it on marksman rifle there's the ground is it ping really slow ideas i want to hear the ping needs a bit more reverb on it i think i think it needs a bit more reverb i mean there's so much like okay this is a problem with the game that i've noticed okay watch how much smoke and visual recoil there is here like it's really hard to track targets it might just be the iron sights but look how much smoke is coming off i feel like you just want a hip fire you know the world is spinning oh no the world is spinning the thing sounded alright hostile recon in the air spies in the sky hello it's me wally goliath two for one special i'll take it i feel like i'm running into a spawn here oh my god airport package stopped in red slide bomb ready for target yeah i got the glide bomb thirsty double kill double kill two for one special on some of these voice lines uh [Music] ow took it down there oh no we lost that was really quick i'm not disappointed you can see why they retired wally yeah me too right yeah he's not great you know it was quite primitive technology back then oh guitar is a sick player isn't he dude that top that thompson though hello i think he even got that killer at the end with the pistol as well m1 carbine i don't know if the m1 carbine's in the game i don't know if he's saying don't think it is [Music] it's not on the assault rifles on the smg's shotguns no lmgs it would be in here wouldn't it maybe in marks and rifles but you just got the grands so i think there's going to be a lot more guns in the game at launch but i don't know for sure love to try that carnita thompson is the best gun in this game she'll try something okay stabilizer you just undo stuff as well that's kind of neat increase the alphabet i'm at 100 fov i don't really want to increase it any more than that yeah blitz domination gavuto now let's go jake i'm part of an event right now this is a content creator an event they've given me access to play the game modern warfare 2 next year hopefully i think so uh i love i can't say that uh yeah i think it makes sense right in the cycle of games like treyarch infinity ward sledgehammer treyarch was last year this year's sledgehammer next year should be infinity ward and they're gonna do modern warfare too come on let's face it i've used the mg42 already luka show the knife and you just have it by default i think i know i get that level 22. i can't it's capped so i don't think i can unlock this stuff guys i'm sorry it's like a weird build of the game hey connor what's up i had sebastian matthew are you gonna show doc the ropes on 2042 he seems to enjoy your content yeah people have told me that he's watched a few of my videos um yeah i mean i'm down to play with him i don't really know him though so you know and i don't want to be that guy that's like hey come play with me if it happens it happens you know it's got to be a natural thing can you equipment can you attach things that reduce muzzle flash and smoke [Music] no muzzle flash concealment i don't know if that makes a difference on your client though that might just be for other people in the server with you people looking at you rather than first person be interesting to try that out though i've shown blind fire a couple times already byron but i mean it's difficult to get a kill with it uh shut thank you for the six there are no camos in this build the game crates there's no cameras in it there is a uh there's a in the store there's a blueprint for the stg but that's not really a camo is there so i don't that's like a tommy gun grip that something about this just looks wrong they butchered that sdj [Music] [Music] it's taking ages gotta find two more people i don't think we're gonna get the dogs sad times what's up chamod
