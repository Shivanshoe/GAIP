free-to-play player versus environment versus player first-person competitive quest shooter that's what the cycle is a new game from Jaeger who have previously developed SpecOps the line and dreadnought a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video and today we'll be taking a look at everything on offer here with the launch of season two most notably a new map I've played a few rounds of the cycles so far and whilst it is quite overwhelming to begin with I feel like I've got to grasp now on what the game is so on a basic level you drop into a map in solo duos or squads and your overall goal is to complete as many objectives as possible to gain more stars than the other teams eventually extracting from the planet via a ship before the inclement weather destroys every molecule in your body completing objectives could be things like mining minerals collecting bright cap mushrooms or defending a laser drill while swaths of AI and enemy players attack you it's a constant pressure cooker and at the same time you have to manage buying weapons skills and equipment and upgrading back to and then in the game menus you have things like contracts making allegiances to unlock guns for specific factions you can also modify the guns with different attachments and also modify your suit and skills is crafting to buy acquiring materials that you find in game there's a lot going on here with this game being free-to-play it comes with a free and paid for battle pass which they call the Fortuna pass including daily weekly and seasonal challenges it's cosmetic only unlocks here too which is great and these change the look of your character your in-game rides drop pods weapon skins archetypes melee skins etc with that said I thought the best way to really show you the game and just get a better understanding of it was to make a highlight video of a match that I played recently with Adam and Tommy this is on the new map called Crescent Falls and if you enjoyed the gameplay and are interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below and it's available on the epic game store let's do this this is the new map isn't it yeah yeah different yeah some blue fauna this is a different sort of biome it's so we've got five objectives here there's sniper rifles gonna be good on this yeah it looks very flat they want super rocky and mountainous oh I'm being shot I run the minerals right and money is shared as well so if we pick up if you pick up fifty dollars we all get fifty dollars right there's some bright cuts up here yeah this is good listen up what's that speed plus one yes yes holy does heat shoot see you have different perks then yeah but it kill the enemies to get money early as well how much you get per and like eighteen bucks that was not much it's quite near us the drill well the drill was a source of much pain last game but we could try it well let's make sure we've all got assault rifles before we do yeah or just get SMG or something I mean a little little hammer kind of now got isn't bad to do expert all the time space pumpkins I can perform SMG now yeah $200 if I just worth having a gun of some kind you can level up your guns as well by spending money just clicking you again in their level up for $100 I think okay it's worth doing that then yeah yeah stick to one gun where's the drill whirs drill I killed a lot quicker grenades worth buying could you come a call down once you've got it amateur burn aids under 50 right let's head over to the drill it doesn't appear to be any fighting here
