juggernaut Royale is the best thing they've added to cod war zone since launch it just is so good I played a few rounds on my own last night and the game you're about to see is nuts it's so much fun the resuits drop at the start you fight over them and if a juggernaut is eliminated another suit drops you got a minigun apart from that it's the same as normal Battle Royale but because of those suits you get more action as they create bubbles of players moving towards each other more often because you can see them on the map it works really well for me it's brilliant also before we get into the match I have launched a new limited edition t-shirt this is war zone survivor and it's a custom hand-drawn piece that I commissioned an artist called Tyson to make it's a war zone player at the end of the game emerging from the gasps victorious and there's a couple of Jeff Easter eggs on there too black white and color are available if you're interested in picking one up the link is below for a bit ugly / shock jock frags and if you use the code for of the checkout you'll get 10% off on today and told your line 6 this design like I said it's a limited edition only available until the 1st of August and if you do get one tweet me a pic of you wearing it with that said let's get into the video and enjoy some juggernaut destruction of course it's storage town or one of them at least it's like one of the worst places you can land up the style again a pop design straight away dude on the hurt someone Oh jumping up and out like a rabbit sorry man one of my teammates is dead took a dirt nap little on drop right here that one was a little close yes uh-huh why would you give this dude oh my me that was brave okay it's the best thing ever I've barely took any damage look at my health what is that let's breathe it sounds as well man people still fine here hide behind a dumpster versus a minigun I think it's time for the music there we go reminds me the doom soundtrack it's kind of like it does feel mental and I'm a teammate's down don't worry I'll protect you with a giant minigun so it looks like even he's scared of me I'm a friendly juggernaut I promise everything's gonna be fine let's go these are the ways to get high kill game stuff I've barely scratched them team I got to finish thank you I suppose someone got to get a bit closer really before I start shooting that's going to tempt everything's fine I wanted to wallbang that ten men now we kill them Oh oh my god how could you be so cruel right the chunk is on his own now boys gotta try and get to a buy station one right can the chunk drive though that's the question you can't hello why even bother why even why would you even bother doing that the chunk is on a mission he's got a good look at it all right Chum frags is my name now that's how I want to be known proper job pal just realize what his name is I buy my revive care as well just in case because Joe nods they can't stop revive their to chunk sorry Marty realm and I see proper job pal the enemy's there plus the strike I don't think so to be fair that's probably a really effective way I'm taking out the trunk isn't it he's dead again I just revived him I mean what is the time to kill on this thing where did you go I don't know why that guy went well he raised the other guy rest as well this is simply unacceptable hi helicopter are you disabled it nice and another cluster strike who is doing this please see the problem with chunk is that he moves a bit slower so you got a run for the circle bit earlier that was a lot of damage why don't you hear me with Wow please out no no stop that my job father is one of just our wine that's got to be a growl that's the only that's the only possible explanation I'm gonna reload this I'm gonna turn it around a murder you yeah can you miss your RPG mate look I should get in and regen about health chilling there for a bit you do actually regen health if you don't take damage so I think this was the right move another guy thing chunk it time to bigger font get out I nearly had me with that c4 say my health is back now blown away believe you guys closed why I set it's just me and chunk got a big really big head worried that I thought it's still there behind man feel like he would've shot at me although to be fair if I was on my own I wouldn't shoot that javadocs ooh wow wow dude what you're going back for your loo no I call you up I simply can't let you live I'm sorry come back killed you once I'll kill you again this is really deadly game of cat and mouse here just jumped into me really open ground though yeah I know it's got a sniper or oh I think I saw someone then no matter the distance I want you to know that deep down inside of me he was quite far away but I just melted him now maybe not a spot idea there's still two of the juggernauts a circle 8 players left the juvenile suits really they're the only danger to mouth think so I need to get like I need to get a jump on this dive spot there wait till they can be closer when they tell die what's good a friend oh no it was el-amin oh no we're gonna reload surely I'll put so much damage down then yes got him one Jurgen old suit left I'm still looking pretty good on health I'm like 50 55 60 percent oh oh okay this is danger did that go underneath my legs you ever get that there's five people left but we're like such a small zone like juveniles they're coming towards me for some reason I think it's time we put the music back on oh you were so low love it are you still hiding there yeah I meant toasted to be one my health has gone all the way back up as well if I lose this game up he's so embarrassed that was a mistake I think the other guy shot at me yeah here's somewhere no there's nothing you could do my friend days nothing you can do yes all right I'll see you in hell oh my god that was so much fun that was so good I'm not had that much money war zone for ages I hope I really hope
