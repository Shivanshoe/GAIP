the strela could legitimately be a new meta weapon in warzone and i'm not even joking this baby right here which before today i'd never even used so last night 11 p.m i was bored on reddit and i noticed the post by a guy called beef juicy hot titled the strela is the most underrated weapon in warzone i watched it pretty cool montage of kill so i thought to myself you know what i'll give it a go today can't be that good right well i was so wrong over there okay nice at the back maybe yeah yeah there you go [Music] finished bloody hell jack everything's mental same spot [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah i've got the rocket ready yep downstairs front door now front door now here we go there's one team marking knocking nice one more here one more hit parking [Music] [Music] what's up thanks are you the real jack face yeah bro what's up oh damn that's crazy i played say that i only had five kills i'm freaking i just hopped on i got an answer kush i've been smoking a bunch read you want to play this thing fires incredibly quickly in a straight line with a bit of dip depending on the distance the crosshairs on it are great too very predictable so you can quickly figure out which mill dot to use it is devastating against vehicles no lock on tone super fast rockets you don't have to leave that much boom and it will down a full health full armor player with one direct hit even if they have eod equipped not to mention if you hit near them it does splash damage and it creates a massive explosion that will put them off honestly this thing is a beast and you can legitimately use it as a replacement for a sniper rifle or as a means to quickly delete a target that's facing you the only problem with it is that the reload is a bit long and you only get six rockets so you have to rely on your teammates and finding or buying ammunition boxes but with that said i was simply blown away by this i went into my games today expecting to just give up i thought it'd be a laugh study in westy but instead i found myself falling in love and you're about to see a match where i was 100 seriously using this as a secondary weapon sniper rifle and it performed exceptionally well for me i think you guys will enjoy this if you do hit that like button below thank you and as always cheers to all these lovely people using my code in
