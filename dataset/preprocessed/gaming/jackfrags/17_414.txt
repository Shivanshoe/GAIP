if you've been playing warzone for the past couple days since the start of season two you may have noticed a couple of weird new weapons that weren't really announced or talked about in the patch notes the update notes at all and that is a bit weird right because we all heard about the two new cold war weapons that were coming to war zone as well as cold war which were the pharah and the lc10 smg but as you can see here this is a gun that hasn't really been talked about at all this is the cx-9 you might know it as the scorpion from other games and it's an incredibly fast-firing smg and you can find this in certain crates in the dance you can't get in your loadout yet or anything like that as far as i know there's no way to unlock it but it's an absolute monster and according to the true game data website if you put it up against the map 10 it will actually beat it in close quarters so this smg has got a really high chance of becoming meta the only way to find it like i said you might get lucky find it in a crate like that and this is a blueprint version of it and there's already five attachments on it you can see it's a legendary it's got a cool weapon inspect animation and it's got a 50 round mag which means that you could easily take out multiple puns with this thing and we don't even know this might not be the best build for the gun because the blueprints or the things that you find in crates often aren't right when you can unlock all the attachments and min max everything you can often come with a better build than what's available in the crate so it could be better than what's available in the game right now and it's also got the hei rounds on they're just high explosive rounds so when you down someone and kill them there might be a few explosions coming from within that victim so it looks really cool when you manage to down someone and finish them off very high mobility with this gun too and i just love how clean that site is reminds me of the sights from bf4 i know you can already get that site in warzone but i don't really use it i don't know it just kind of looks different on this particular gun nice clean sight picture even at range there drop that guy quite easily it's powerful weapon this 100 will be a meta choice and it will be nice for something to finally replace the mag 10. now this is the other new secret modern warfare weapon because these are modern warfare guns and there is a pistol as well but the videos that i've seen are in the co-op survival mode i don't think you can actually get that in warzone yet but this is the ural lmg and again you can find this in crates it's got a brand new site on it too with a rangefinder as far as i know that site isn't in the game already but it's uh awesome lmg it's a four shot kill to the body so it's pretty high damage profile throw a headshot in there you're gonna be down in people and it's really competitive up against the brewing the amax or the lmgs like the pkm for example could be another meta choice when it officially releases and you can put it in your loadouts don't know how we're going to unlock this yet might be a mid-season event there's rumors there's going to be a new season for modern warfare which i think would be awesome a lot of people still play that game they enjoy it they prefer it over cold war so maybe modern warfare making a comeback more modern warfare style weapons in warzone i'd welcome that so that's a quick look at those two new weapons let me know if you managed to pick them up yet down in the comments below we're still waiting on the hotfix for the cold war attachments you may have noticed that some of the builds you were using on cold war weapons that were effective in the past weren't quite as effective anymore that's because they accidentally changed a lot of the values on the attachments for the cold war guns and the bullet velocities just got nerfed into the ground but i reckon that that will come tomorrow fingers crossed but in this game that i'm going to show you next i was using two classic modern warfare guns because i just felt like it loved those guns with the amax and the tried and trusted mp5 amazing secondary weapon and we had a really wholesome interaction with a couple of players at the end of the game after the lobby but tons of kills here crazy early game we just got stuck into it straight away and had a lot of fun as always i want to say a massive huge thank you to everyone using my creator code in the cod store the supporter creator code is jack frags in all caps the amount of people
