hi everyone and welcome to some BFG life gameplay commentary today we are playing on knock ass monolith and hopefully you can make some plays here look at that tank there we go that's not about started the video is it so my primary today is the AS VAL as you can see helicopters are raining down from the sky oh you took me down m416 thank you for the rest I appreciate that we get another shot at life it's all good few things that I wanted to discuss in today's commentary first of all lots of you guys have already noticed this but a couple weeks back he actually just released like the old battlefield games on Steam let's fight all the old recent ones I should say because a bad company 2 was I was already on Steam I think a couple of different ones were too but they caught the f5 bf4 bf3 bf one now all the more modern games on Steam and it's kinda meant that there's been a bit of a resurgence in the player base because they're not like different versions of the games are still the same client I think if you've got it on Steam it just kind of opens a halogen window or something I'm not sure because I don't actually have any of the new origin battlefield games on Steam as far as I know you just buy it on Steam and then you can play it with all the origin players it's actually had like a really positive impact on the player basis of these older games the steam is a massive platform there's a little device down there showing people my locations really enjoying it because it means that these older these older DLC maps that typically you couldn't find a game on are actually populated again you know maybe there's a lot of people who when EA release the origin and went okay one of our games are gonna be exclusive on origin for a while when you know what I'm not doing that I'm not gonna buy the new battlefield because it's on origin you know some people are so dedicated to their platforms that maybe there was people that did that I think it would have been better though if it was its own client you know if it did load like a steam version of the game that was cross play with origin that's what they've got at the moment it's kind of just like adding a shortcut almost but used by on Steam there's so many enemies over there but if they'd have coded a new version of it I suppose would they have to have done that made it so if you buy on Steam and then you open it on Steam it just pops up like a lil log in origin box rather than having to install origin that would have been awesome I don't know if that would make a difference to the sales or the plain numbers but I mean I know a lot of people who would prefer that it was that way if when you bought it on Steam it is just on Steam yeah it's got nothing to do with origin but it's good either way yeah I'm happy the EA and dice are kind of relaxing a little bit with their platform of steve savuti sony their games really in my opinion it makes me wonder like will for the next beer came be ice team will it be on the epic game story maybe it's really push out the amount of people that have access to it in that building there someone shooting at me it's definitely someone underneath I don't like this position get off this thing just choose people are bad yes that's so good hey we're gonna laugh guys it's not often I get to use vehicles in these old Abascal games they're usually just haunted by people can we get any kills though let's say I see you have a tower that you you control the towel and this is why I don't have vehicles so just the end of getting killed stray away I don't really want to put it in there I'll be missed why is this a leader him why am i doing more poorly call him up there and screwed you got him someone else just hit me then okay just popped him in the head sounded like a cat honestly it sounded like a cat that's a tank come on she's just gonna keep shelling the corner isn't it that's a hit keep applying the pressure the thing is I'm hitting the front armor right now there we go something else beeping and beeping there wasn't one hostile bird like a really big eagle - bird is it alright mate see this cheeky L over here all lovely so satisfying it's definitely a bit of a disconnect in this game isn't there between like hitting the vehicles and them exploding there almost appears to be a bit of a delay with it for some reason I don't know why you think it's the netcode is it the way the animations work or the destruction effects I'm not sure they just come from this little corner here someone is pressing us heavily there what was it just a guy on his own brave little lad helicopter let's go let's go and him get a get him oh I thought I was going for the tail come on come down here come down here I'd say that's it give me the shot okay yeah that was quite cinematic wasn't it that was also flew into the building what is that little bird dude honey run behind us how awesome did that look by the way just for that abrams in that little bird there it's so good it's such a cool map isn't it this it looks good let's go great flow to it finding your battlefield enormous in here just stand still just firing this little LMG excuse me I mean the dude is literally stealing my kills from the little bird I'm not even mad that looked awesome it's a bad spot Hey yeah let me go let me go keep getting stuck on all this stuff that's one thing that hasn't aged well about this game please on the right in case of me yes you are wish I could revive you my friend I just want to just keep getting stuck oh man let's get out that was close I just half there okay I'm right in the top I'm capping it can I get up there I'm gonna try like this someone right above me I can see the traces they are nothing mister knows that I'm here you certainly didn't as one boy here he's been killed could we do it yes all the way from the ground to the top how awesome was that Wow I'm over be free little bird or whatever the tank I find help with my rockets that must have been a hit come on dice don't do me like is it dead yes dead I think that's two helos just did a number on it how cool does that look come on can we just have this back dice but just new ten minutes later is it gone it's gone gonna blow are you dead that's really weird I'll get your head down man oh I need to keep my head down it seems boys this bloke doing here recons gone crazy dead yeah good hello are you doing you've been absolutely chomped by that hallo what would you say is a bigger quantity guys will you say chunk or punch which ones bigger I was having a debate with someone about this if something is chunk or if it's Pudge which one's bigger let me know down in the comments below I think it's Chong but I don't want to sway your opinion although I already have find out so I'm sorry I didn't mean to our movements really laggy around this way instead don't want to run head-on nice girl think a few head shots there maybe with someone right there right yeah I'm gonna just fire rock in there why not look at D on the mini-map they're all over that would be a nice blank here though if I'm lucky I'm on the ground dude yes s foul that's the tank you didn't see me right you didn't see me you didn't see me you didn't see me okay maybe you saw me but it's okay we're friends we've decided we're friends what are these it's almost as if these guys are communicating with each other calling out targets for each other it's a mating ritual I mean I think they need some help I'll give you a little touch don't worry are you gonna be able to get out of there there's a big pole of course what a pro put that up there so many so many enemies here is awesome should I just want past someone I think maybe I did the colonel of battle got me is that a tank it's something Rene's at it why not don't even have that helps I don't think it does it's definitely explosive though and I'm okay with that laser effect is so horrible so so horrible please run into me come on run around the corner I can see that you're right there there's the gun look yeah there we go yeah thank you it's one right above me push up a little bit I think there's more back there still excuse me yeah the damage on this is a bit lackluster at times right we got it we got the bank nice he loved that all going down oh I think the enemy one come on get him okay I've got the guy repairing it pistol versus helicopter I'm dead now though it was worth it he was totally worth it I think we've got this one in the bag though to be honest yeah can I get down no I'm below me no it's been really back and forward good game this I don't really like it when it's an absolute walkover it's just kind of boring but like this you know when it's a bit of a challenge it makes it more fun it's more satisfying definitely just falling down stairs also totally you've really really noticed the damage drop off of this it does Trump people up close though and the fact that it's got that built-in suppressor is nice but this guy yeah I mean he hadn't m16a3 you know this is one of the best guns in the game right here he's got a suppressor and full grip on it as well so he knows what he's doing I mean I nearly lost that fight can we get one more kill before the end of the round I don't think so but that was a good game that was really fun so that said I hope you enjoy that guys thank you for watching if you did like it leave a like if he didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
