i'm really looking forward to this one in part one yesterday we met arthur kingsley we were captured [Music] did a little operation with arthur and then we saw what happened with paulina in stalingrad [Music] and today we're going to be learning a bit more about wade the pilot i think that we should finish the game today really looking forward to seeing how this goes thank you for coming along if you guys enjoy this leave a like with that said let's get into it now sit back relax and enjoy wade had talked himself out of worse situations if you heard him talk about midway you could tell he was no stranger to hyperbole every time wade told the story it was a little different he added a wing of zeros or another aircraft carrier to his tally but i read the reports about what happened that day if wade was exaggerated it was only by a little [Music] remember our primary objective is destroying the two japanese carriers vs and vb squadrons will each take one fighting squadron six will provide cover if the weather holds we'll be in and out before they know what hit them this wind will give us the pacific now go out there and get the carriers bit of a briefing as if this operation wasn't hard enough now the entire war's on the line relax hernandez i was born for this not too sure i was ramos jackson vamos they finished repairs on the plane this morning she's waiting for us on the flight deck she has a name you name the plane our plane and you didn't say anything you never asked this reminds me of that bf3 campaign mission oh that corsair do you think the intel boys got the fleet position right they better if we pull this off they'll be writing about us in history books yeah well i'd rather not be history today so do us both the favor and keep the crazy stunts to a minimum stunts ouch buddy you ever wonder why you haven't been promoted yet why is that smart ass hush this isn't the way jackson show amigo this is war all of us just want to win and go home you worry about keeping the zeros off my tail and i'll get us home hey hold the elevator that's cool gonna give me a lift i got you jackson take us up how many medals do you think we'll win if we pull this off after today they're gonna have to name one after me miller just remember we're a team up there and stay in formation this time of the sack will have both your stripes formations just slow me down you see what i have to deal with it's a road look at that it's a beautiful day this line let's hope it stays that way it's time mano salamasa a lady awake timbuks says i down more zeros than you jackson come on man don't encourage them they're taking away all the blocks now this one's ours radio check for sugar 17. hear you loud and clear intercom's working fine hey they're signaling for pre-flight checks that's working fine all right elevators are good okay jackson let's check the ailerons flops are working right wing's good great now they let the other run left wing's good all right do an engine run up make sure she doesn't blow out she's burning it sounds all right here we go full power release don't strike let's go you're no fun this isn't supposed to be fun fancy tricks i wouldn't dare [Music] so you're gonna tell me her name or what which one the plane this plane still hung up on that well what do you want to talk about fine keep your secrets oh damn that's a lot of planes victor aircraft who's out of formation [Music] something's not right oh my god mg's someone's going down [Music] they're on my sticks i need some help down below me i think might be punching out fights that way jackson taking too much heat difficult to find that one [Music] [Music] unlocked goodbye we got one down here try not to crash into our friendly planes [Music] boom 17. boys and someday you'll be in jackson's seat god i hope not watch that flight boys coming up on the plane back in formation japanese league claws keep steady so we've gotta do a diving bombing run on the japanese flight they're firing a hell of a lot of a.a at us start your run here we go here we go hold on to your ass hernandez you see the ship down there give it tight what's that break the fire there it is can we avoid that i think maybe we can whoa that's a guns got that was very close we really kicked the horn into that full of zero so many i can reload this cool oh two for one there yes [Music] [Applause] where are they all coming from this one's smoking not long for the world you got it picked off we need to climb squadron is not responding losing too [Music] many i think he needs a hand slow down a bit come on come on stay on target got him we're goodbye get as high as we can do the second die it's good that i've got him for the ammo shot so many away my goodness [Music] that's not good that's 17 you took a beating there you good she's fine zero stand ahead come in hot take him out [Music] that's flying right at us now [Music] keep going down has bomb that's three hundred yes he's gone he has one anyone else okay that's 17 an s-18 second bombing run can we do it behind isn't it us be close enough all aircraft draw a fire from s-17 altitude altimeter i think you better hang on back there fancy flying guys fancy flying come on come on come on we did it yes that is quite a fancy explosion [Music] wade would rather have been called a hot shot than a hero that was his contradiction he is one of the war's greatest pilots but he needed a team the problem was getting him to admit it not fancy enough hey guys don't everybody rush over at once i'm fine isn't this a nice little reunion you lied to me for we knew he was dead so you can [ __ ] off really do not lie to me again [Music] well that's quite sad take your hands you haven't heard what is going on hitler is dead what how with his allies reports indicate he took his own life but without the fury we are lost [Music] hardly [Music] i trust you have no information [Music] as you suspected the american was six men but i believe i have finally broken him it saddens me to see the fatherland define i feel the irrations know this there's nothing left for us here if the reich is to live on i must know their safe passage to temple have i was counting on you richter better approval non-essential no no no sir no i will get you what you require i sweat your time is short i understand mindful i'm gonna kill him the rector is on to us we're out of time i uh i tried to navigate away playing but that didn't work and by the time i got here you you guys were already locked up so i uh i borrowed a bomb from the rooskies and turned myself in we got about uh about an hour before that wall blows wide open and we waltz right out of here if we live that long i can't trust him he's just a [ __ ] pilot a [ __ ] ace pilot is what you mean i'm with the lady what the hell do you know about explosives yeah well [ __ ] you too then i'll tell you why we can trust him here we go wade's more than capable of getting us out files in hand [Music] [Music] does that work [Music] [Applause] [Music] music reminds me of inception very good [Music] okay airborne he was the most dangerous thing in the skies but if you fly too close to the sun eventually your wings will get burnt got too cocky didn't they bougainville papua new guinea still standing stupid they could've gotten us both oh [ __ ] all right okay i'll get you out of here but it's gonna hurt like how hey wade where you stay with me wait come on man no you're not wake up wake up wade on no today's not the day i need to find out where we are so i'm gonna have to leave you here think about the yankees [Music] oh your bedside manage sucks you're welcome pendejo ah i need your gun lost mine in the crash the one you caused what am i supposed to do keep yourself bandaged up i don't want you bleeding out and missing all the fun they gotta sight till i get back some asmr right there i mean they're right there oh no we're injured the views all are wavy it's like wade's drunk or something let's wait press four to focus what the man's got a wall hack fair enough oh that one's coming right towards me i mean matteo doesn't sound like he's having a good time over there i have to be honest i'm coming buddy are there all groups up there do i even have a gun though or a knife or anything little knife type 99 bayonet there is a tripwire in front of me here get rid of that t-rex come in i hope not kind of crazy that the man has a wall hacker it is what it is you know this looks so good volumetric lighting shadows texture detail on point i'll get over there oh nobody's filming [Music] it could be anyone hiding here though one up ahead here sneak across the log you see me i think i've got a grenade as well or it's a stun something like that what is this oh oh yeah they used underground cover like that a hide-in sneak up on people and surprise them lying wait i don't see anyone around here got a bit more ammo now as well if we need it within range of this transmission lieutenant wade jackson requesting immediate support nobody any americans on this damn rock 100. [Music] sneaky another bomb there and a soldier luckily we can defuse those quite easily some people up there in the bunker oh there's so many here and more ammo i've noticed with this campaign ammo is actually quite rare they do give you these refills sometimes but in the sections like this with the stealthy moments barely get any they want you to play it stealth i'm fine with that though that's kind of cool crossing another log this one's a lot bigger please hold i don't like that they're all running away i'm getting predator vibes from this there was three though can avoid them or these holes what if one of them is booby trapped i don't i don't want to think about that there's a plane here reminds me of tomb raider or indiana jones or something been there a while well that's going to attract a lot of tension isn't it i don't was that a good idea hello how did they not see me wade's walking around with a hole in his body not ideal uh [Music] ruined we're gonna be tortured now oh no it's a boss katana chicken do you speak japanese [Music] some american foods toasty flamethrower hopefully i can use that i'll be great [ __ ] up they're still alive yeah no [ __ ] cut them free i'm

kind of want him to do it all you know what is this gun like you know what that reminds me of red dead redemption i'm sure you could do that in red dead redemption what is this gun by the way just hold it up on your left shoulder like that that's strange is that a multiplayer i don't know what i'm aiming at [Music] like a bit of ammo what is that playing cards what we need that was a rifle wasn't it better got some longer range here obligations to our country never cease but with our lives you think it's the type 97 that was in bf5 wasn't give lindy's gun it john adams we can use to help we'll do what we can don't get us killed and that might be enough i have a brother fighting in europe if mama loses her voice to both nazis and japanese well hitler ain't got nothing on mama mama

on the heavy fire i need you to turn up the heat on these bastards you got it sarge get to flaming a word yeah you're gonna help private howard get that wire and then you're gonna keep him covered on the other side understood look in the sky i'm your man but this i'm not the die face down in the mud type then you shouldn't get yourself shot down there's a difference between suicide and sacrifice you do well learn it let's do it wade so i've got to follow lewis jackson to the left this is very sus there's no cover here apart from these dragon's teeth after you well i need a hand quick no big deal you can cut yourself so easily on that stuff i've done it a few times oh payback [Music] get that billboard i think we got him [Music] oh you just stood that way look at flames for everyone i

[Applause] should we do bullet time again it's done go go uh well the bullet time didn't help then [Music] just got a shotgun in the mouth straight away he just blasted me go go this time want my flamethrower back take out that kenny focus reload imagine if you could do that in multiplayer i'm annoyed with everyone [Music] i'm taking out all these cannons i want to do a canon yay thank you i thought you'd never ask we did it what's going on in here then shoot the player let's see him stop us now are you [ __ ] crazy why would you fire that here you just gave the entire japanese army our location the invites not for them is for the rest of my men right on schedule lieutenant the hangar here japanese tanks that was a plane val dive bomber you know what i'm going to fly this was your plan all along my men could take the base slow down the japanese but if we had someone in the air wouldn't that be something i'm a man surgeon yes it would i was hoping you would say that let's get down do you even know how to land that thing what's that ever stop me [Music] i'm gonna get to the plan regroup with the tanks [Applause] don't even know where i threw that i just do it it's just easy mode when you hit that button game just plays itself oh i thought there might be an easter egg i think that guy's bugged yeah let me have a flamethrower again please that's what i really want sounds a bit like the battlefield davis you use the cannon oh it's a chair [Music] come on tanks keep pushing look at these shermans make yourselves at home use them as well that's an enemy tank right there is this what it's like to have a wall hacking an airborne warzo grenade you just went for a bayonet charge on me wow oh my goodness he just stood right behind me okay i can't go that way obviously i have to wait a second it was you that killed me okay let's get in the plane that guy was wearing a cool guillotine though i enjoyed that that's good we'll push you out of the hangar take this good response i recognize his face i think he's quite a famous actor with those legs [Music] can i focus on this i can actually take out the plane it keeps like aim bought me back there yes there's a plane coming down this is classic call of duty single player campaign right here i mean surely there's no one left where we go anymore show us what you can do lieutenant all right let's see yeah more or less i should have known you this is a lot like it here we go right there uh [Music] [Music] [Music] the men of the 93rd changed wade humbled him they showed the flying daredevil from the clouds what war looked like in the dirt down there he learned the only way to win was to have each other's backs if you get past this talk you see his actions you know who way jackson really is i don't care what he did before wade abandoned us in hamburg i still don't trust him i get it but we're not in this [ __ ] because of him we're in this [ __ ] because i'm starting krauts think they can crack the best team i've ever worked with now we need a plan to get us out of here we're surrounded by nazis even if we escape we're gonna be dead before we reach the door maybe not oh just a knife that's not a knife this is a knife what an idea [Music] we were going to put on a show for richter it was a gamble but we'd come too far to give up on getting those files perlina being next gave us time to get ready we knew she'd hold her own that is mary from lord of the rings isn't it dominic mohan nice to see you again fallen [Music] please please this is exactly what i imagined your weird little office would look like [Music] tell me what your team is planning lady nightingale she was wanted by the germans because she killed so many of them [Music] stalingrad the city that arrested the nazis eastern expansion had the city fallen russia would have crumbled the germans underestimated russia's will to survive they underestimated the city and her defenders the people looked to polina as a symbol of hope but she didn't want to be a hero she wanted only vengeance it's called batman i'll get the job done she's also based off a real person you heard stan has been creeping around the commercial district makes sense it's never far from the slaughter let's go and wait we should see who the earth within their families now short that's a sniper shot precise you think they might be okay there's more cover this way come on the full sniper mission is it uh real name was um so where will you kill ludmilla something pablochenko i think i told you to stop lady death they called her the name gives the survivors hope would win this war in bastards to followers of lady nightingale anyone who gives asylum to this terrorist will face the most severe penalties selfie let's go up this way do you think the sniper could be one of steiner's jaeger motors we should jagermodus do you hear that take a look the vehicle i think [Music] misha be careful get down [Music] signal misha to draw sniper fire try drawing fire with my knife do what just trust me [Applause] [Music] it's a reflection of the knife isn't it enemy at the gates [Music] i don't really want okay i was gonna say i don't really want to push forward [Music] [Applause] i didn't see that one on the right [Music] [Applause] he's got ppsh do i have a secondary i have a ppsh [Music] get a hard cover here as44 [Music] [Applause]

nightingale brought stalingrad back from the brink her actions inspired the russians to take back their city and go on the offensive [Applause] palina changed the course of the war for the allies and her people with that reputation it was only a matter of time before we found her what would frysinger want with a lowly officer on the eastern front what does it matter it matters a great deal to me fraulein [Music] nice lighter from what i could gather frisinger was recruiting steiner for some special project project phoenix could be all i know is i was sent to kill risinger there's got to be a better way out of here there is no way out of here unless of course you have decided to do the intelligent thing open that door back up and i'll show you the intelligence thing you can get me out of life what i can you two face bastard all right i'll tell you what you want to know typical aussie no honor no loyalty sacrifice in your crusade tommy i hope your plan was worth it oh it's all the bait

growers you got it all wrong mate they don't follow i don't care what color his skin is haven't you heard about the aussies and the brutes we were the pieces of [ __ ] flushed down the crown's dunny yes yes of course but your nations are allies it was more like master servant i did what i did because to every brit folks like me are expendable it's not true i love the aziz insubordinate churlish no stranger to a prison cell that's lucas you had to credit the soe they were very good at spotting talent in the unlikeliest of places and lucas had talent he was a skilled demolitionist with an explosive temperament and a sharp tongue out there in the desert the rats of tabrik were like a family unfortunately they never did figure out how to get along with the brass today princess i'm savouring the moment i'm so sorry of course you are your highness hey bluey wake up you're going to want to see this one oh [ __ ] me play the damn cards all right tears wait him and wait oh you [ __ ] donkey no way why the bloody elements are at your post your hands we thought you thought you'd muck around major convoy's approaching right you rats follow me try and act like real soldiers for once up to brooke what a way to stand up to him bluey good job buddy [ __ ] off dares what is even doing here in the first place huh he's a major i can do whatever he wants we're looking good what is that i was about to make me come back shut up jess you've never beat me at anything what ah paul the other one oh he's bloody posh british guy the explosives are ready lucas and i set them ourselves sir man your position do i not get to do that yeah i do must be perfect i need you all to focus you got eyes on them hang on now what's that in the be quiet i'll do the honors thing yep mark is that first rock yes i know that's a tank germans have tanks private but the armor's too thick we didn't pack for a tank hit the treads it's the only way you're going to stop it i i need to focus sir wait for the treads no no wait you're distracting me hatch i like this this is a perk in multiplayer isn't it see the ark of the grenades oh it's quite explosive very good stun grenades i feel like this gun's going to be really good in multiplayer [Music] this lucas guy that i'm playing with by the way he's one of the voice actors in romo succeed he plays one of the operators on his head that was a big one cease fire cease fire i was just warming up find out where these trucks everyone's dead lucas search that one on the edge didn't get very far this was a simple raid and half the supplies we wanted have gone up in smoke sir there's still one truck down the river he is muzzled get after them james let's go thank you for sniffing around the dirt what's kind of weird though is the guy that this is based off in real life was from new zealand but they've kind of switched it and made them australian let's go from the campaign watch out one's still alive we can fix that can i interrogate him good night kraut i wanted to ask him about his extended car warranty then we find him you can switch between grenades with this guy yeah that's more rifle than you can handle bigger the better mate bigger the better mate wasting time let's go fresh blood follow it [ __ ] genius idea jacobs that's sir to you the names and that's funny and neither of us give a [ __ ] about your rank we all know about you jacobs us rats pay attention more than you think quote do you hear that can i go up here who's he shouting to this way i wanted to be out there bloody hell wait you can easily take them that's a good way to start shoot that sniper i wish i could give them orders like i could with arthur damn they shot a flare let's move excuse me but then we're leaving it's the new warzone map hey i found something caldera you read crowd a little of course a little it looks like one of romney's officers checked through here to visit a camp up the way i don't know what kind i don't recognize these symbols then we go take a look the crowds just lit up the sky more could be coming no we returned to base report to the major we can't report a thing if we don't know what it is that wouldn't be good soldiering jacobs fine we'll scope it out everyone loves a good soldiering let's trade quietly this time yeah i think i could have done that stealthy but that's that's not my style can we use the car why can't we use the car yeah straight into those cracks get off the road before they see us into the ruins went the wrong way i told you they saw the flare that glow on the horizon must be the german camera i say we stay off the road we'll cut through the desert we can go down here right get the cover quickly dude you're gonna get made you want to sort those bullet holes out dez is this the developers just trying to test your patience do you think yeah i'm not engaged can i move up now i'm gonna assume i can move up i wasn't very clear so they should all go over there to that player instead the car's moving i bet this would have been very different if i just started chewing that just bounced off his helmet i think it did really flexing the engine here aren't they with the

gonna come back around isn't it [Applause] what the sam hell was that on the coast of italian libya an australian private and a group of rats had given rommel a huge black eye their actions should have earned the medals and maybe even a shred of respect pam's didn't see it that way their reward was some time in the brick however all richter seemed to care about was rommel and his connection to frasier that fool would listen to lucas as long as we needed him too what was the rest we have very little time tell me what did frysinger want with rommel i thought you wanted to know about our team answer me now our idea is off okay okay don't get your undies in a twist lucas piled it on like a champ he didn't have to tell richter anything more than the lies that nazi already told himself that was the third reich for you their reality was delusion [Music] you'd think we'd need a miracle for lucas to pull this off the thing is oh we're going to lr man for that kind of luck battlefield hello about lightning striking twice yet lucas had managed to find himself first and to brooke and then at el alamein the world knew of an allied victory in north africa but it wasn't because of british commanders or mighty tanks lucas had the untold story and richter was eating it up [Music] i don't like the brits in this game do they got himself a big sniffy today he must smell a promotion after the intel that we dropped on that wanker this is the plan that he comes up with buckley's chance is going to work what's he saying jacobs oh he's personally thanking you and dez for being stand-up chats it's staffed it's king and country it's always king and country bloody hell is that what i think it is where'd you swipe that from found it lying around he catches you with that you're a dead man i'll drink to that can we not use the tanks that'd be good come on [Music] good rag dolls as well in this game do you think they said rpgs in world war ii was that a phrase that they used i suppose it could be they didn't have rocket launchers obviously hey don't worry i've got my little line that i can use it's fine that was from downtown [Music] that's about to say i need some more grenades right there [Applause] this gun was in bf5 as well can't quite fire as fast as that though still i'm gonna it was cool i just bounced back sorry guys you're dead oh robert picked it up he

me away then why the [ __ ] is not available only i could use that that'd be great wouldn't it pick these off one by one cheers well that's a stone compared with a scope on it that's cool although i'm not sure i like it there's a lot of visual recoil on where is this engine it's a body what's up that's a lot of a lot of dead people it traversed i'm not even use this yet i'd love it about an mg42 right i haven't now one for a while boy all right german infantry are swarming our tanks well then let's mess with their infantry oh yeah we'll just waltz our way through a field of death well we're not here to [ __ ] spiders what that's a strange strange phrase let's go with it this way come on this reminds me of call of duty too i'm the single player cowboy hat i'm sure i recognize that face from modern warfare hello let me get ready very michael bay mean that has to be the best sound i've got in the game so far what do i focus on crazy come on tank push i'm not going to use this yet

ham's face when we pulled this off you joking he'll just say it was all his idea you know this reminds me of it's another thing from bf5 excuse me watch out for the grenade i feel like they've got infinite grenades oh my god i just ate a rocket i had a panzer track or something throw all the grenades that's how you deal with things in call of duty campaigns throw the grenades until the enemies stop sporting we're gonna have to hold them up until the bombers arrive help me with this mg can i use that let me use that that's an mg-42 with a guard on it this fire the freight the stump cover never existed to begin with is that right xander expect today to end like this there is a big one here we're not to this or not to that [Music] you think they got that sound right for the mg-42 i feel like they have more perhaps not that i've ever heard one in real life but like i've seen a lot of movies where it kind of sounds exactly the same as that ah the mg is [ __ ] and pick up a rifle war machine i coming in to the right i see him that's awesome i presume that's the kill streak in multiplayer war machine's been in a few call of duty games though it's got a lot of recall on it [ __ ] crowd to the left side i want another war machine yes that doesn't count as a breach my man come on this is good fun i'm enjoying this that's the one that i want to use and the game just goes sorry mate oh some s mines here it's just [Music] [ __ ] how many do we have panzers well how with what yes we're not done i need a rocket launcher yes all right that section is very similar to one of the levels in bf5 with billy bridger sometimes the only way to honor what happens right at the end is to finish the mission and guess from call of duty but try remembering that while their blood stains your boots rest in peace does can we get an f in the chat for desperate lucas when we first met war had taught us that the rigid hierarchy of allied command would look at lucas and see only character flaws insubordinate childish no stranger to a prison cell oh he was [Music] [Music] you're looking a little bit pastier than usual please this was this was never about winnings or war this was never about winnings all this was a cool this was a cool temple off that's how it's getting out taking the right underground wait a minute you're not part of the plan are you well it looks like we're both

range against german soldier ever again not conducive to good health will die [Music] oh you wade ready reaching clear [Music] hey lucas you got a banger for me giving me best absolute banger [Music]

nations will make sure i'm well taken care of no he deserves to die come on come on he deserves to die feast our new beginning life of american luxury might suit me perhaps i might even start a new family not for you there is no starting over [Applause] is your new beginning do you even know who i am the value that i can provide everything burns you're not worth it suppose that's it then let's get up here [Music] how are we looking out there gonna be dicey just how i like it [Music] all right we're back in business that's it let's take a look the cape verde islands the bahamas argentina even antarctica christ these bastards have been plotting covert operations all over the world i'm gone are we gonna are we actually gonna see the warzone map here we go [Music] aldera we hit the bloody jackpot [Music] come on dig in how about this project nova i can beat it project ether oh they're tying it into the black ops story does anyone want some nazi gold looks like we're going to be busy keep going open them all here we are about to try this autopilot and come back what's project aggregate secret v2 rocket facility you think you can fly one of those huh i can fly anything hang on back there [Music] guard [Music] we did it i think that's the end what do we think chap very impressed with the graphics and the animations i have to say quite short though i think my total play time's about four hours or four and a half hours or something great great soundtrack as well i think my favorite mission was the stalingrad one i expected it's a bit long to be a bit longer than that though because the world war ii campaign that was also made by sledgehammer that was a bit longer wasn't it that was more like seven hours so quite sure [Music] but yeah some great action moments um i mean they're doing a lot of stuff in this campaign that's done in previous card campaigns but they've just up the production quality i think [Music] seven out of ten is that fair for the campaign [Music] the worst bit for me i think was when we were flying the corsair in the pacific i don't know what that's like on controller but that felt really horrible on mouse like there was a load of input lag on it it was quite difficult to aim it'd be interesting if they make more campaign levels in the live service though they didn't do that with black ops but they did weave the narrative into the live service and into warzone [Music] yeah i wish it was a bit longer as well so i think like 6.5 7 out of 10 i think that's fair just the production quality was pretty insane yeah the stalingrad mission though definitely my favorite because i actually built the character of polina and her family and there was a lot of detail in it and it had some cool stealth moments some nice sniper moments as well i think if i were to rank like the last three campaigns i would go modern warfare 2019 top i'd put this second and i'd put black ops cold war third that's that's my order in terms of how much i enjoyed them but apparently yeah modern warfare 2 is coming next year that could be special did you enjoy this guys thank you for coming along honestly i expected it to be a bit longer than that but it's fine i was thinking maybe like six hours rather than four typical length for a cod campaign isn't it anyways i need to go and get some food once again i appreciate you guys being here thank you for the kind donations camden marcel gabrielle triplex eric winter thank you very much guys appreciate that bravo 6 going dark so what i think i'm going to do is over the next couple days i'll be streaming the multiplayer i did try the zombies but i didn't really like it to be honest i felt like after an hour i'd experienced everything and i felt like it was a bit of a step back from black ops cold war zombies not enough depth not enough weapon variety not enough upgrades really so i can't see myself playing zombies again until they elaborate on it make it a bit more advanced make some new levels because there was barely any variety in the levels either not many upgrades either like the perks [Music] that's kind of a shame about zombies but multiplayer i haven't played it yet since the game's out i mean it's only out today right so i'm looking forward to playing the multiplayer from what i've heard online it's pretty decent for a cod multiplayer so i'll definitely put a few hours into it and also you know using it to level up the guns for war zone because the new war zone maps out december 2nd and that's what i'm looking forward to the most but we will be streaming the multiplayer over the next few days so look out for that [Music] first stream will be tomorrow for multiplayer [Music] cool right if you enjoyed the stream guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like leave a comment great way to help support me enjoy your weekend i'll see you next time bye [Music] you
