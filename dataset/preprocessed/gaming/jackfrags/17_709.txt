hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to a new warzone video today we are going to be talking about cheetah's so I play a lot of warzone off stream off YouTube and in the last three or four days I've come up against more cheaters in warzone than I would like to admit this footage here is from earlier today and it inspired me to make this video because I'm kind of getting sick of it now and I think that if more isn't done about this in a timely fashion the reputation of the game the player base in general this is going to have a massive effect and I think that Activision Infinity Ward Ravin whoever's working on this game could be doing much more to deter these cheaters to ban them and to make the majority of the matches that you play fair and without the presence of a cheater so we'll get into some of the things that I think they could do to help that but as you just saw this is a solo game from earlier I dropped in found myself a gun and I was instantly beamed by the guy in the tent and I thought that it felt a bit strange just how fast that guy killed me and of course I watched the kill come back and it was just nothing but headshots with no recall so I won my gu like I parachute back in and I wanted to just double check just make sure I'll drop back in the same place and the guys still here he does hit me quite a few times here through the wall and eventually runs in finishes me off this kind of confirmed it for me so I thought you know what I'm gonna watch this guy see what happens so to start with this guy is a level 126 it's not like this is a new account this guy has been playing for a while to get up to that level right that means the the anti cheat system the thing that is scanning game files and looking at statistics obviously isn't working it's not working if someone can get to level 126 and obviously cheat as much as this guy's doing then there's a problem there and this type of cheating is what I've been seeing the last few days it's not someone who is attempting to hide the fact that they're cheating it's this shooting people across the map beaming them with absolutely no recall looking through walls shooting people through walls it's the obvious cheater who doesn't really care I suppose that people know that they're cheating they just want to run around kill people and ultimately win the match so what does that tell me well that tells me that there's probably no stats based anti cheat system over watching this game and what I mean by that is a system like fair fight where it looks at every player's information so the number of shots they fire versus how many they hit and what percentage of those shots are headshots for example and with that information you can ascertain how likely someone playing on that account is to be cheating or not cheating because there are average values there are players who are just really good and then there's those insane levels that are not humanly possible and the fact that this guy's account is 126 and they're playing like this that tells me that maybe there isn't any stats based anti cheat at all and if there is it isn't aggressive enough and dysfunctional ineffective now admittedly this is a big problem for the developers to try and solve and a couple days ago I seem to recall they tweeted out that they'd banned 70,000 accounts but of course when a game is free-to-play that's kind of irrelevant it doesn't matter because most of those people will probably just sign up for a new account again more needs to be done but I did enjoy watching that cheater get blown up with c4 just like we're driving around in the car but as I was watching this I thought you know what I'm gonna wait and see what happens cuz the guy's obviously gonna win his gulag really parachute back down and kill the guy that caught him yes is the answer and so respect I think again there we go gets a nice load out there so what more can be done about this well I think one of the biggest most impactful changes the Infinity Ward could do right now for the overwhelming majority of the player base to keep most of the players safe is to disable PC cross-play for ps4 and Xbox players just turn it off and have it so only PlayStation and Xbox can play together and this will have a profound impact because the cheetahs are on PC and I'd imagine that the majora of the playerbase full war zone is on console so that's one way straightaway that they could have a big impact on temporarily fixing this problem for war zone yes it would suck for groups of friends who play on PC and console because they just couldn't match with each other anymore but I honestly think in the meantime for the greater good maybe it's the right thing to do until there's a more efficient system in place both PC and console for this game do have an option in their settings to disable cross play but when you try and queue for war zone it says that you have to have it turned on to do so and I've read online that on Xbox if you turn off cross play in the Xbox settings it just won't ever find a game and on ps4 you can keep turning it off but your queue times might be really really long so the cross play option it seems just has to be turned on for warzone matchmaking to work so that's the first and quickest change I think they could implement to make a profound positive impact on the cheating situation just disable cross play for PC and have it so only consoles can play against each other for the time being what else could they do well let's be honest here if you know anything about multiplayer gaming on PC you can never completely stamp out cheating there will always be a cheat so what you have to try and do as a developer or a publisher is create as many hurdles as possible so once someone gets banned creating a new account and actually getting back into a game becomes exponentially more difficult it becomes annoying in a sense that it takes a few steps before you can queue into a real match and that kind of thing doesn't affect most of the player base because most of the player base are legitimate players who only have one account so it won't have an impact on them and some of those measures for PC players are things like linking your phone number to your account counter-strike has done this to massive positive effect they have something called prime matchmaking and all it is you link your phone number to your account and your account then becomes a prime account as in it's trustworthy and when you match make you will only be up against other people who are primed status it's free to do and I would assume that most people who were playing Call of Duty warzone in 2020 have a mobile phone number that they can link to their account I'm just talking about PC here Xbox and ps4 users wouldn't need to do this it would just be a PC specific thing so linking a phone number to your warzone account could become a mandatory thing that you have to do before you can play the game and this means that if you cheat if you get banned you can't use that phone number again to play the game I think that would also make a huge impact something else too hardware bans and IP bans maybe they are already doing this I don't know it doesn't feel like they are but a hardware ban for most people would mean that if you get caught cheating you will actually register the ID of your hardware your PC the specific components inside and even if you create a new account with a different email address a different username before you can even get into a match it will scan your information and say this is the same person that cheated before it's more than likely they're cheating again and just not allow them to play the game or just banned that account straight out and that same thing applies to IP addresses as well if you're caught cheating your IP gets banned it doesn't matter if you create a new account you would need to get a new IP address before you could do that and I know some people will say and you're probably typing down in the comments right now but Jack it's easy to get a hardware ID spoofer and it's easy to get a new IP and I would say to that most people probably don't know how to do those things and the people cheating here are probably kids and they don't have access to that kind of thing they don't have money to buy that stuff and that in itself is a big deterrent and when you start layering these things on top of each other that's what I'm talking about with hurdles you've got a stats based anti-cheat you've got a more robust anti-cheat that's actually being updated regularly and checking just things that are running on your PC you've got a phone number verification that needs to go in your account before you can play and then you've got hardware ID bands and you've got IP bands all these things together are hurdles the average kid that's doing this probably wouldn't be bothered to try and overcome if their account got bad because with an anti cheat feature set like that doesn't just become about spending time anymore it also becomes about spending money and all of that together becomes a massive deterrent an annoyance to try and cheat again with the free-to-play game you need to put those barriers in place otherwise it will just never be any better and something else that I think Activision could do that's really out of our control is go after the people that are making these cheats epic games actually sued people who were making these cheats they went after them to set an example and take down the individuals and companies who were developing cheats for fortnight and that's a big deal because that's potential time in jail that's potential fines for hundreds and thousands of dollars and that's scary for the people who make these cheats because instead of just are making a bit on the side for developing these hacks it's now if I do this I might actually end up going to jail or facing a fine and it could ruin the rest of my life is it worth it now probably not I'll just stop making the cheats so Activision could be doing more in that respect just dissuade the people developing these cheats and just stop them creating them in the first place my point is that this isn't as simple as just having an anti cheat that runs in the background of your computer you need a multi-layered approach to this and their current systems just aren't working and I really believe that they have to do more here because this will become a massive problem and a massive problem in a very short amount of time the amount of posts and YouTube videos I'm seen of people complaining about this is rising every single day for me personally after this happened this morning third day in a row I was just like you know what I just don't want to play this game today and I love warzone I think it's a great game it's really fun but if every other match I'm going to come up against an obvious cheater like this or even someone who's trying to hide it then you know it kind of makes me not want to play it I just really hope that they can get on top of this and get on top of it as soon as possible because warzone has so much momentum right now they've just announced that they have 50 million players within what like five or six weeks of it releasing so it's immensely popular and it's obvious that they're going to continue to support it so it really is in their best interest to lock this down and see if they can fix it find a few different solutions as soon as possible so what can you do if you come up against an obvious cheater well you can't actually report them if you come up here and go to your recently do you play as you'll see everyone who was in your last match scroll down find that player and then you can click on them and report them for cheating something else you can do as well is block them and if you block a player and you happen to get into a lobby with them before the game starts you should get a message pop-up saying someone that you've blocked is in this Lobby and then of course you can leave that Lobby and hopefully join another one that doesn't have a cheating for the meantime apart from that I think if you're on ps4 like I said you can disable cross play in the account settings and it will say you should keep it on and try and keep it on but apparently if you just keep saying no eventually you will find a game with just ps4 players Xbox unfortunately it looks like it just doesn't work from what I've read online so you have to keep it enabled there but with that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys what have your experiences with this kind of thing being like so far and how would you fix it fingers crossed something changes soon though anyways leave a like if you enjoyed the video or dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
