lore is that they're full of cash if you've seen the walking dead yeah you know how it goes why else do you think that they're trying to kill them all the time they'll be loaded afterwards i want to pay off my apocalypse mortgage you should go to that buy and get our loadout roger roger and now yeah so far i like it i don't have to constantly be worrying about every single flank it's not as sweaty as the main game modes this you can relax a bit give you a little bit of a fact here jack did you know that halloween was made by irish people no it was made by the celts interesting for the scots gods and the irish you know what i was thinking about this the other day what's it actually what's it celebrating um dead people i think it's just the night of the dead yeah enemy dropping into the aio he's gone got it i remembered my buttons the instincts are kicking in you know how we ride a bike you fall over a couple of times playing war zones like riding a bike yep have you got a ghost loadout so you can stay off the uav jack i'm not going to lie to you i forget what i have those guys in a truck it's the it's the guy from sword driving a truck really fast have you seen the other movies or just the first one uh i've seen up to like five i think no way hell yeah brother somewhat of a movie buff so i watched saul uh zombie over there you know i saw the first one the second one i thought the second one was awful so i didn't bother with the rest your position yeah the second one's not great first one's good though dude i'll tell you what watching that in the cinema so good i didn't see the twist coming yeah it was i think the sequels kind of ruined its reputation but the first one's legit oh on the roof here bro yeah accept him flip his wings take it down let's go and
