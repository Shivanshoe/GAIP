dice have just released a video showing the first ever gameplay of irish in battlefield 2042. it's a very short clip but in it we can see irish using his specialist abilities in the first clip he throws down a deployable shield and then peeks over the top to kill a couple of enemies and in the second clip we can see him use the other element of that specialist fortification system the aps and when you put this down this will actually detonate any incoming rockets and that's all guys i'm gonna play it without my commentary thanks for watching if you enjoyed it leave a like catch you later remember this is bigger than us you
