hi guys and welcome to crossfire x today we're going to be playing the single player and the reason that i'm interested in this is the remedy actually made it and remedy are a dev studio who've made some of my favorite games in the past max payne and you guys remember that max payne 2 as well i think and then you've got other great games like alan wake control that may is it quantum break as well i think but i didn't really get into that that much but um yeah this really interests me because i don't know if remedy have ever made a first person shooter before and most of their games are really high quality but um this is a bit different because it's come out on xbox today and there's like a free-to-play multiplayer component of it but there's also the single player and the multiplayer and the single player are by different developers but there are two campaigns at the moment in this single player i don't know if they're intending on adding any more campaigns in the future but we're gonna just jump into it get stuck in and see how it goes at the moment the campaign is only on xbox i don't think it's on pc or playstation but i'm looking forward to this hope you guys enjoy if you do leave a like if you're new here subscribe let's go information is the most powerful weapon if it was possible to see into the future you'd know how to win every war before it began global risk had intel the blacklist was mobilizing local insurgents in asgardia we needed to find out why they sent us in to extract alexander steiner the blacklist officer in charge cut the head off the snake happy hunting i've not really played an fps campaign for a while either one should have been an easy mission i have no idea what i was walking into okay 30 seconds and go randall they look very tactical don't they hey south side of the conference room concentrate fire on the north side oh he's got that minigun though [Applause] oh slow motion okay there's some barrels there boom sick smashed him in the face [Music] wow oh my god oh there we go i can change my fire mode i can just activate slow motion as well whenever it looks like that's cool it's weird because it speeds up time when you shoot that's kind of a different take on the slow motion thing okay okay can i get this ak oh bye [Music] how did i fail what what did i do wrong there i don't understand we've got incoming get ready anyone know why i failed then it just say you failed sorry you're not good enough goodbye you go slow motion again you can deactivate it too afterwards i've got grenades no it does not like it it's really difficult to see i need ammo oh there we go some ammo there it'll be good practice for my controller skills as well and when i say skills they're pretty non-existent cool slumber effect [Applause] going in there [Applause] grab the goddamn cable ow employees must wash hands does that go dead yeah i'm just ak clash they've called it flash oh yeah that's the max payne coming out very dramatic ow it's got a little peek up as well i can kind of shoot from cover [Music] [Applause] no it's not on pc at the moment i don't know if it's ever going to be on pc you can slide as well oh we did a boost that animation was a bit challenging about this mission's been easy hi this way get inside max of judy 2043 that's good [Applause] it's good enough okay he's gonna die 100 you've got another explanation no but come on we need to get to the safe house i like all this tactical gear ow hey i got you buddy somehow blacklist had known we were coming set a trap for us too many nagging questions meant our heads were not in the game kavanaugh paid the heaviest price is it on game pass i think the first missions are getting past imagination can kill you and the multiplayer is very i think i'm so strange too real more than a dream what the hell oh this is the max payne again like a weird dream sequence look at these photos what the hell it's an impressive cacti there are like two modes available for this as well on the xbox i'm playing it on the series x i'll look at this toy room oh i used to have this stuff when i was a kid it's best to have a house with my wife evelyn and the kids but everything felt off a skew as if it was somebody else's memory of my home yeah you can play performance mode or quality mode i'm playing performance mode because i like the fps [Music] how far in kane i've just started literally just started playing it this looks like pt you remember oh no it's a horror game now is it rob they shot you oh i don't what's happening i couldn't save you i'm sorry oh something's wrong what wait that's me it's some kind of sci-fi element to it obviously you're in the safehouse raleigh what where's robin did he i'm sorry man i really am he didn't make it insurgent killed kavanagh snuck up on you i got it more of them came i like his head get you out of there i know you guys were close man i'm sorry this puts you in charge your squad lead now just like old times a boss yeah why is there an echo on the audio we can't call the chopper rob kavanaugh had the long range radio christ you sure he's dead no doubt so what do you think we uh make the border on foot we lost kavanaugh getting here we're not gonna make the border what about the comms tower blacklist set up next to the hotel you want to use their gear to call global risk only way to contact our ride we should secure the landing site you take care of the lz and avoid enemy contact if you can stay safe okay randall and i will take care of the comms tower let's go randall okay paul let's go i mean this feels very call of duty doesn't it randall copy not too far plenty of angry rebels between us and here though it's our only shot at calling in that chopper so understood i like randall's voice morales will check the evac point of its choir they'll be looking yeah no kidding let's make this quick marcus ramsey steiner had become impossible blacklist and every local rebel under their command knew we were here our mission now my responsibility was to get the rest of us out alive i think we can do it randall hold up control versus chaos global risk versus blacklist as cargio is an unstable region just the sort of place terrorists like blacklist prey on but we didn't know why they were here what their plan was what we'd soon learn what's their plan nobody knows not even chat knows it's a bit sketchy isn't it clear gunfire somebody's been living here it doesn't look like military but i haven't seen any civilians [Music] steiner went to a lot of trouble to say so he really doesn't want global risk knowing what he's doing here hold on didn't come this way before he's got like a dmr or something there what's going on nice dynamic lighting there i like that pick a target i'll get the other one i'll get the one on the left you get the one on the right three two one fire targets down i'll be more of them the closer we get i should get on the rooftops spot them for you i like it give me a boost a boost is it one step ladder coming up warface i don't know if you can do this in the multiplayer when you order modern warfare from wish mean i've got a faith in remedy i don't know what the budget was for this game i just reloaded one bullet i'm an idiot no take down animation it's been a cool five minutes look forward to five more thank you man i've got grenades yes frag grenades i don't suppose the place is empty but it'll give you cover from we just going in okay you don't really need to aim down the sight to be honest hipfire is really accurate well there's a bit of spread and bloom oh look at this shotgun sword off i throw a grenade in there have some of that titan thank you for the 20. well the range on this isn't very good and that guy had armor what the that's an interesting painting just spamming through the wall what the hell comes from that slow motion randall i can see the hotel what the hell that was close i just hear them shouting at each other that's a really cool slo-mo effect i wonder if i'm going to get like any other abilities i've just got slow-mo right now i think that i had like two choices back there as well like two directions i could have gone because there was two yellow markers maybe you just end up in the same place can't find an exit heading into the basement don't get trapped i think he's got a scope on it ow colby it's got a little red dot on it there's a grenade what okay randall i can't find a way out look along the walls there might be a guy got a tiny window wish me luck can we get through that okay i made it okay the road to the comms tower is blocked the only way through is the hotel the hotel great that worked out for us last time come on ready oh this reminds me of bf3 i think he's right there dude oh ruined can't get to the hotel from here can you see our way through randall let me take a look i guess i could jump up here yeah it looks like it anybody see that global risk guy no he disappeared he can't before is that a sniper they've got big red lasers i like this gun collateral hello move over here one down here one there i think i'm all clear copy i've not played the mp for like two years ken i played it a couple years ago but i think the game's changed since then so i can't possibly comment on the multiplayer it's out now though i think it is free as well if you want to try it find a way into the hotel make your way to the ground floor there's a drainage ditch that leads straight to the comms tower be careful the lounge ball i'm not looking for a replay of the last time we were here what happened the last time we were here down it's blocked can't get through this way randall i can't find a way in i'll check the intel hold on is it up here probably the enemy was there so gotta be randall whoa look at that sniper rifle here but it's in pieces it's a big 50 cal man you'd love this randall i bet the locals never dreamed of hardware like this before steiner showed up blacklist has all the toys can i not use that please no well it is in pieces so there's a comms tower getting close we gotta go there there's a crate i've already got that don't i i think that's the gun that i have yeah oh you have to flick it okay that guy was really quick and had a shotgun what's that about dude was gonna rush me look at him he's quick even when i do slow-mo he's a little whipping bashing around everywhere unknown city thank you the three there's another crate there the deuce i don't even see that guy the doctor no we don't be needing the doctor here we were here it's like cinco de mayo in here cinco de mayo stand there and take the grenades what does cinco de mayo mean is it day of the dead was that something else when they have like the big carnivals and stuff i think that's all of them where's the exit according to evelyn's intel there should be a door to the lobby i was a bit confused there like what's what's gonna happen chunky boy mexican independence oh i see thank you this will create a distraction time to go do yourself i don't think that's what it is bang [Music] random i made it out close to the cardstock how could i go home without him how could i tell my wife his sister that i had let him die i pushed the thought away how's it look out there randall they're searching for you but they're making a mess of it i'm not in the way of organization i'm almost at the comms tower how's the lz you better be ready to move that zone is clear believe me i'm ready to bug out this mission what i signed up for i'm nearing the tower now i can see lots of movement ahead expect company why do people keep saying boogie man who's the boogie man you mean like john wick baba yoga i wonder what engine this is kind of looks like unreal engine 4 but i don't know it might be like a remedy engine or something oh what's that it's a little is that a reindeer with an ak what the hell i'm playing controller kiss it yeah you can only play this on xbox with controller oh no okay boys it's ready to haul ass i don't think it's got mouse and keyboard support it's gonna be here pretty fast right on hey boss be careful in there oh yeah yeah i'm just saying that ruckus at the hotel isn't i'm in the elevator it should only take a minute just gregory am i going to play elder ring yeah i played it last week a bit i'm getting the card i wasn't allowed to record though just got to make that call make the call that's ben i was about to see a glimpse of what blacklist was really doing in azcarzia would be the first time i heard the word catalyst single player is remedies north light multiplayer is unreal okay thank you who's this please i have this under control i've never heard that from anyone who wasn't scrambling but if you'll excuse us we have work to do just don't make me clean up your mess how would you give me get him in the chair steiner looks like lando norris no slander your friend where is he you already killed one of my friend's you're getting out of me is eat be polite i assure you rob kevin was quite alive if you cooperate maybe you'll get to see him that's he's not responding well sir enough i don't have the time or the patience for this where is he how did you know we were coming where is he up huh piece of increase the dawns and hurt him bad no no just make him talk i need to end this before she uses this as an excuse to shut me down the stuff they'd given me made my mind real but that was nothing compared to the bomb steiner had set off kavanaugh was alive well there you are where'd steiner go in the mines checking to see if your friend survived a catalyst the catalyst maybe this starts with an eyeball just to establish a baseline no the rest is up to you jesus man don't worry don't worry just a little flick of the sky oh what the deuce oh that was sick different perspective i'm with randall now walk away do i just shoot good night we just did the cut scene guys how cool wait company in the cable car i'm going to protect it big sniper rifle get up that's it what'd they give you come on just move hole how about we go those are weird what's my exit bottom floor they got me okay you better protect my ass gotta get out of sight i thought i was gonna die there boom headshots [Applause] thank you again oh here we go dead can i take it out or do i have to wait there's more x-ray vision maybe yeah oh god movement i don't have a line of sight oh i repeat i don't have a shot [Applause] i mean surely he's dead the whole building fell on him he's gotta be dead right what do you think chad dead or alive everything was spinning out of control it felt like the air was still in the racing so but it wasn't morales and i had a history of fighting side by side even before we joined global risk he'd have a big part to play in how operation first frost would turn out in the end what the hell oh randall say you morales got a complication yeah you think comms tower came down on top of hole could still be alive i'm asking mike to check on him but yeah yeah i get it i'm close i'll get to the tower see if i can find him what's left sorry guys you're between me i've got an ng look at m249 or something i literally not hit that guy oh there we go nice dice it's literally on him dice there you go is there someone there i don't know i'm just gonna shoot the explosive barrels that's always the way there's another one there i thought there was someone there i was just being hit through the bush by a guy with a shotgun that doesn't seem fair i really like that effect though running out of ammo 11 bullets [Music] i don't like it when i throw a grenade start shouting is that a barrel there yeah i've got some armor a few moments later i will get the reload it's a bit confusing because that guy's got the same gun as me and it just sounds exactly the same unless there's a bug or something i think i just have to keep pushing up here barrel yes one more guy out there i get him yeah that's quite a difficult section here i couldn't rush that i think i would have died if i just ran into that somebody please kill this guy what the terminator oh okay i feel like i could have died quite easily there oh my god don't kill me don't you dare kill me sorry where's that coming from i just walk past you randall half the building's gone i'll try and find him this just won't bust him oh man this ain't good oh oh sound off always alive you're right chop i hovered at the edge of consciousness fading out steiner's words of kavanaugh being alive echoing in my head the dream started out the same back home everything felt awry somehow this was not my dream and possibly i was a visitor in someone else's dream kavanagh who was trying to tell me something something vital and urgent what so this guy can live people's dreams it's inception then it's always inception isn't it i mean that's full inception isn't it doctor strange maybe i've seen things what the that's the team that's the four on the ceiling weird it's a max payne prequel i don't think so sure i don't think it's connected to max payne you need to hurry [Applause] yeah i knew it'd take more than that to kill you paul good to see you randall now can we get the hell out of this god forsaken red infested town change of plans rob's alive ah you were there when he died man no he's alive steiner told me steiner toy dude he's in the mind we find steiner we find rob this is stupid man we need to call the evac and go we're not calling with that and we're not leaving rob behind that's an order a goddamn order you're a new sheep to be in charge you want to fight me on this morales 1v1 would you have i still if it were you just walk away so the mines it kind of looks like lock from halo 5. she got ahead we'll take the side route and keep a low profile this was a mining town we headed into the mines where blacklist was hiding their secrets given the scant evidence i had maybe i shouldn't have believed kavanaugh was still alive i didn't care even the yellow font reminds me of control somehow they were both tangled up in this mystery close to the mines now should be a railway bridge leading to them let you know when i see it copy that be careful sniper mk12 okay change scope i've got hybrid on it old signs areas off limits some kind of mining accident plenty of traffic though any sign of insurgents negative nasty gap in the bridge the railway bridge is broken it's in bad shape but i think i can get across copy we're on the way to the mountain pass but they'll be guarding it time to go to work oh i think it's on all xbox platforms apart from 360 of course i don't think you'll be able to play this on the 360. good work almost trade killed go quiet yeah there's a cliche for you uh-huh slide into the cutscene oh no big boy heavy presence excuse me boom i think what is that it's like an armored truck or something get your together and fight can i use it armored lad is quite the chunk i'd like to use this doesn't like you can what's the situation hold on it feels like a shooter from like 10 years ago it's a big boss zero dead you've got scars got an rpg sounded like a goat what the that was weird i showed a grenade to me i think it like locked onto the grenade then know something super weird i want one of those scars please we're there the whole time uh moe sure thank you for the three months love you glad to do my bit and supporting your journey thank you man that's very kindly there's a lot of spread on the guns i can't get the scar sc762 that's got a hybrid as well that's cool that feels a lot better explosion kill that guy i guys dying light too hello [Applause] go go go [Music] could have been worse could have died i guess yeah i made it across okay what's your status in one piece train didn't make it i'd say you got your diversion got eyes on the side now sir it's a total loss no movement return to bait steiner had disappeared into the mines if we got to him we'd have a shot at finding kavanaugh finding out what the catalyst was and why it was so important to blacklist why was it so important minimal resistance you got their attention earlier we're staying out of sight it'll be another couple of hours you should be arriving near the train yard we'll find a vantage point up high gotta get up there so randall just an fyi punchy here is walking pretty much normal now he's still tripping though god damn man morales like i don't see you looking at that ain't there they're all saying where it goes it's not affecting my judgment remedy just love the sci-fi don't they yeah god damn it he's not like unharmed so it's just a little crazy you're not analyzing me we keep going copy you're the boss is it worth it jack well this is on game pass i think so you could try it yourself i think the second campaign you have to pay for but please correct me if i'm wrong and the multiplayer's free that's where we'll find steiner wedding on you randall's diversion had gotten us close to the mine entrance without any resistance but that wouldn't last we had to fight our way through blacklist to get to steiner to reach our goal how do we get in right hey nick can you see your way around these patrols you want that building up the hill the mine entrance is behind it i'll clear out any opposition for you speaking of not for long go on i'll go you covered don't worry another one on the left steiner was arguing with a woman fontaine seems like their operation isn't going according to plan so how's kevin a fit into this we'll find out once we find him he's in that mine morales okay holmes company a lot of it losing them better move to the other window oh no it's loads there get ready want to take out the first one the rest will react copy can i do a clap not quite oh there's a sniper there wow i didn't see the sniper randall can you see your way around these patrols i know how to do this now and the guy comes here i've got wall hack guys so i know that he's going to be here any second not for long there we go he's dead there's gonna be one coming down here coming out of the path he's dead another one on the left oh you got another one here like that there we go and then we move to this window it's we'll find out once we find him he's in that mine morales okay holmes ready once i take out the first one the rest will react copy [Music] they line up down there the snipers up here you killed me i hate you there's another one [Music] moving window can't see the area from this position man this place must have a million hiding places how are we supposed to find steiner he's not exactly hiding they're eyes on him as we speak could kill him he's heading for one of the processing buildings up ahead so i guess we'll pay him a visit dave thank you for becoming a member it's very kind like he just loves his m249 doesn't he hey you with me sure we gotta get started he's blacking out ain't no we you're not in any shape i'll get steiner but they know we're here now you head back give me support if you can okay fine all righty he looks like a resident evil character just make sure steiner can still answer questions i'll do my best so what's your plan i got two plan a try to stay quiet get close grab steiner get out and plan b uh wing it i everything we were after was in the mines blacklist steiner the catalyst and kavanaugh i had no same reason to trust what kavanagh had said to me in the dream but he talked about a machine breakfast was using to dig into his mind was that the catalyst i've seen enough of this mission out here and it's worse than my thoughts what about the result with kavanaugh he's uh he's a silver lining certainly but that's what costs an accidental success doesn't validate about strategy i can take care of steiner no i will deal with him personally your mission is complete you've redeemed yourself oh subtitles kind of gave that one away didn't it is that just an optional thing can i get like a suppressed weapon or something if i've gotta be stealthy i don't have an option to like put a suppressor on i'm sneaky now you guys know if you watch me regularly i'm really really good at stealth the way these buildings are laid out you can't just walk up to them then you better figure out an alternative route for me right working on it i just use the trains there right in front of you the old walkway the numbers mason what do they mean this place is falling apart you're tearing me apart that's a lot of heavily armed between me and there that's the building rail was on about gotta get in there i feel like i have to go loud here there's no way around these clowns can't see you from my possession i got this mitchell thank you for the 10 have you tried ready or not yeah i've done a few videos and live streams already or not already are they just gonna see me oh they haven't seen me yet forever okay so that's yeah i'm just gonna go loud i don't think i could have stealth that to be honest based on that narration grenade i keep getting shot by things i can't see that doesn't seem fair they're just shoot me through that wall are we going up yikes bump all the things that sound effect reminds me of metal gear solid use my grenades a bit more i feel like i'm playing operation locker wasn't banana i hope to god they make another fear game i really do i love that series they need to reboost it how did you get it on pc it's not on pc lucas brown it's only on xbox i'm playing on the series x a little bit tanky so lucky for me that they leave all of these red explosive barrels everywhere isn't it when you go into that mode your sensitivity goes crazy oh look at this look at mp9 check that out mp7 maybe what is that chat is that an mp9 or an mp7 yeah there's a pathway mp7 i think it's an mp7 we're going to go find steiner will you ever play with doc i'd love to play with doc yeah made it in copy sniper another m249 see i wish i had a sniper now should have gone from outside oh this one right here guys would you look at that as luck would have it there's one right there the second i walk on there i'm gonna get annihilated it's definitely not an mp40 i can tell you that that's a world war ii gun doesn't seem to have any penetration though this colby are they back over there now oh oh my god wow conveyor conveyor who says conveyor maybe it's just the good accident should be able to get to steiner from there is there gonna be a boss oh it's resident evil now oh look at this trip mines great gonna have to shoot them can i not disarm them hey when all i got is a hammer do we have a face on steiner's location yet negative i'm relocating just keep going he's close here's hope careful of the trip mines this place is a maze but they got rats the size of dogs in here wraps the size of dogs rolling around in the dark dodging trip mines steiner i want to find you and you're going to pay morales wasn't any happier about the situation than the rest of us less so and he wasn't shy about letting me know but he was following orders regardless always a pro behind the jokes and bravado i didn't know if i was making the right choice but i needed answers maybe that was wrong of me can you imagine a rat the size of a dog are we horrifying what's the biggest rat ever recorded what's the guinness book of world records rap how big is it someone must know someone google that i bet there's an easter egg or something where you can find one otherwise why would he have said that turbine hell more blacklist i didn't have an option there that was just like oh you get spotted now sorry okay these are tanky ugh there's a hitbox problem there isn't there shotgun i don't like that i like the range i see the sky bridge look at that score run towards the pain yes indeed tower jesus 20 inches is the biggest rat what the hell is that 28 centimeters long paulina that's a big wrap [Applause] [Music] the gambian pouch rat is up to nine pounds the average size is three pounds measuring 20 to 35 inches from the head to the tip of the tail king luke thank you you could have made that whole thing up but regardless i believe you i believe in the giant rat i saw this like um you know dying light too it's got like a load of easter eggs in it there's one where you uh you get the force choke actually from star wars i'm looking right at him i'm gonna shoot him in here i could wing him too risky i can take him just find me a way to the other side of that electric fence okay the fence the power cables lead to the mine entrance morales i'll have to cut the power oh sure i'll the building next to the crane randall i'm still over here i'm moving there's two shots if you hit them in the head yeah there's loads of cool easter eggs in it you can get a finger gun as well but the force choke one's insane i need some fire support here right now i ain't cutting copy that i'm gonna move because you have to go around and collect these five ducks and they're in really obscure locations and then you get them and then you find this like really well hidden elevator and you do this whole like demonic summoning and then you get the fourth choke [Music] i'm dead man down i don't know if there's any more in there but i'm just doing that anyway look at the wow are there any easter eggs in 2042 there's only like one that i know of it's like a shadow of colossal hey this could be a career moment for you holmes i just listen you god damn it guys get me out of here what couldn't you just like toss a grenade over something ow this counters cover i think sir oh my screen shake i can't hit anything oh no six okay can't see me anymore can i put c4 on it hey oh he's in it oh detected as well burn bread it's never gonna end is it this reminds me of like old arcade games like when i was a kid like silent scope or something like that it's got that same kind of vibe you guys remember silent scope i don't know maybe you're too young but it was like an arcade game where they actually had like a physical sniper rifle and you looked through the scope and that interacted with the game and you aimed with it it was sick i used to spend all my pocket money on it when i went on holiday target acquired yeah you know it and i've got steiner you sure it's him this time yeah we got him time to have a little talk thank you for using prowler shutting down prowler okay let's i think you can go me to global risk screw that you're taking me to rob kavanaugh lando science club is great man nobody ever listens i guess we're all here to go [Music] you got the guy what's the uh what's the sich rob's in the mind what the hell his  is our guy what's the siege okay bro [Music] you're on point randall okay so i mean we know this mine's gonna be crawling we've got this very bad black place boss right here ready to eat a bullet if they start something  if that guy was my boss i might take the shot anyway i think i could live with myself yeah trust me if i was your boss you know and keep your voice down why i thought you're in control nobody in control don't try my patience it's obvious you need me alive so don't pretend you suddenly drew a pair face it all you're stuck with you need to stretch of course who's that woman earlier your boss didn't seem too happy with your performance what now you're quiet you didn't answer boy would i why did you take rob in the first place how did you know we were coming what the hell is this all about goddammit are you taking that time that elevator you'll get your answers soon enough oh he's tripping out hey phil this whatever he's leading us to it ain't gonna be no good please let's just get out of here we're not leaving rob morales all right homes knew it was a trap you're completely surrounded stay where you are yeah took you idiots long enough shut up lady back to hell offer he's dead that's fine by me you must be joking you were warned steiner your ends justify the means approach is sloppy and frankly a liability so are you going to kill him or would you like to surrender and let us finish the job we do have you out guides thank you now mr morales mr morales morales ain't like i didn't try to see you clear hall you know i needed the money oh no you will deal with our problem he's a rat he's the biggest rat out there yeah of course i suppose you live with this the same as you did selling out your team no what the hell thank you and now two more oh hold up lady that ain't the deal steiner is one thing but there's no god damn way i do this we're operating under changing circumstances we must kill her shoot her yeah adapt to this click oh no principles in the face of adversity i can respect that on the other hand you can do john wick move on him a man that gets cold feet when it's time to follow through on the deal jane wick morales he ratted us out now he's dead shocking oh my god that's so bright it's a dream or a nostalgic visit home this was an urgent distress call from kavanaugh warning of the present pleading for the future as insane as that sounds i knew it i felt it it grabbed hold and pulled me forward we're back in silent hills pt why remedy why want to be a test subject oh no the picture's falling down not like this i'm seeing things that can't be real it doesn't make any sense it's very strange on the wall it's the future okay now let me just say something when games do this when they put real video and real pictures in games it always feels very odd to me because you've got like the style of the game with the graphics engine and whatever art they've decided to put in and then you just put a real person in and it just it just seems so weird lots of games do it to me it's just like do it as an in-game character rather than a real person what the hell [Music] you can tell this is a remedy [Music] game love all this trippy stuff don't they oh no was that me being tested on we're running out of time me where you are we can't let blacklist have this information it's too dangerous i can feel them pulling in from my mind you have no idea what i've seen tell me where you are you have to find me he's communicating him telepathically wait because they're both the same test subjects somewhere i don't know oh shy sir randall this is nick so good randall come here not advice too morale has betrayed us fontaine betrayed steiner the mind that's brought even more confusion into this already shattered mission randall fell down with me but vanished and kavanagh he was in this maze somewhere and i needed to get him out i got stuck then what'd you do morales how could you sell us out oh janky on remedy are actually working on their own first person shooter though aren't they like pvp from the ground up it's called operation vanguard or something like that that could be good i could feel my mind slipping away dream and reality merging kavanaugh couldn't be here but he was these caves were as deceptive as blacklist itself was kavanaugh a beacon or a trap what if he's both these boys are all riled up not because of me i don't see any boys i can blur the green ones can i okay it's a bit weird when you're hitting those guys in the armor because there's like no feedback just feels like you find nothing at them sometimes my controller's gone crazy that's weird grenades i think it's like a poisonous gas or something are you immune to that are you just throwing your own grenade on the floor it's fine oh throw more grenades at me i want that give it to me i mean there's some crazy camera shake [Music] it's good that they're throwing grenades though you know actually makes me move position i can't just stay in the same place i remember the first game i played where i actually thought that ai was good and they were doing stuff like that and it was half-life one like they would flank you they would throw grenades at you that's really good you know considering half-life one came out what 1998 was it 97 or 98 just from memory [Music] was it 99 [Music] one of those years best of three [Music] okay i've cleared it dude what the hell that shotgun's got no range on it whatsoever should be a bit longer than that machine gun joe again over here get down there son jesus how deep does this man go some horrible bosses message to me fused with my reality these tunnels are driving blacklist soldiers crazy too let's go let's do this new mechanic okay hate these things you'd say blacklist was all over those mines they weren't just conducting an op they'd set up shop down there whatever they were up to it was big okay i wasn't sure where to go there hello without anybody shooting us he was very cockney probably a bad idea all these gas around very far mobile i assume no way this is out to god you really need a cutscene for this unless it's loading something and keep falling down i gotta get out of here that was another one of those things there must be like oh there we go 4 out of 30. collectibles um dice i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make it out sit down here i wonder it's going to end up like blocking out something [Laughter] first to breathe oh no i think it's actually like doing tick damage now or something go go go go go go i can't fit in there hey daniel from vancouver what's up man well it's my worst nightmare that's just being trapped in a cave i'd hate it so claustrophobic oh thank god flashbang more than any vision that had come before this one felt vital somewhere in this pit of shattered granite blacklist had buried an operation so valuable they needed to hide it from the world at any cost i had to find that room paul can you hear me randall i know where kavanaugh is we have to get him now what are you talking about oh where are you randall randall come in what the hell did blacklist dig up down here whoa this is massive i can see these what the hell oh my god what is that that looks badass fontaine you got one of them at the excavation site orders what don't let him reach the facility kill him understood it's just not your day buddy randall had to save him what phone am i playing this time zebio it's on the xbox series oh you okay still breathing how do i kiss him yo mama i discovered later randall had landed above me immediately he got back on mission without so much as a groan randall's just tougher than everyone else i'd like to get a new gun i feel like there's not been much choice we slide down there nature knows how the universe works science is the race for human understanding give me your gun it oh minecraft there careful fast boy it's like the best gun in the game by far that's stupid how good it is should put the hybrid on what are they doing here can you hear me i'm trying to get to you but these tunnels are taking me in circles damn these tunnels trying to figure out what the sci-fi angle is you know are they going to go really crazy with it or is it just going to be like military experiments like psyops warfare and like psychomantis stuff or is it going to be really sci-fi like aliens good snack decisions i mean we got the sniper right so we're going to be sniping i shoot the rocket oh yeah you can look at that that's awesome i didn't actually expect that i just thought for a laugh let's try and you can actually do it jump shot suppressing fire oh my god [Music] you can do better than that jack come on what slow-mo drag shot this guy's like got such a high kd ratio oh the aim assist there hello that's a cool little bit of gameplay okay i think i got a bit too overconfident there damn it randall fontaine we got one of them at the excavation site orders what there we go don't let him reach the point save him kill him understood it's just not your day buddy [Music] i mean that's gotta hurt your hands oh did you get him paul a real time cs go montage feature hell no but i'm with you it's only on uh xbox awful does yeah down here rely buddies it's like the ramp from 300 isn't it you know the movie 300 they do like the slow motion ramp and when when they hit the target it speeds up and then they go for another target and it slows down then it hits them and it speeds up it's that kind of thing so you can predict the future as well [Music] that's memorable someone make a gif of that [Music] some of the expressions are very odd [Music] sniper time i don't know why it's sped up there oh i think i was gonna make it then he looked like surprise chipmunk didn't it when the humvee just flew over oh no he's just doing the shooting for me you can use the slo-mo to escape sometimes as well like if you're about to take like one more hit and you die you can just hit the slow-mo and doesn't look like they can get you i think there is going to be a boss fight though i presume there is i just feel so archaic like just putting barrels next to everything oh that's not hitbox pawn that's not what we want don't kill that guy yet i've got to thank him i think [Music] kobe there's a lot of bad guys here nothing down go up a level this is ruining me in the back there new guns give me a new gun no they're all the same there's only like six guns or something i wonder if there's gonna be new ones in the next campaign level because it's like a completely separate thing damn it's pride that's right and all the gate switch is dead i'm in the control booth i can hack it from here give me a minute i can hear more of them get ready oh no slow motion m60 okay that's a lot of bad guys there i don't know if i can deal with that of course i can i've got red barrels everywhere oh no i'm gonna die this is crazy what though grenada oh come on it's right on him there we go shut up it's so annoying with that machine gun yeah we did it guys yeah i just got absolutely bothered mate but we're still here where's coming up there that outpost call our birds gonna need immediate evac i can do it oh my god yeah there's a lot of spread on the guns rust lots of blue it's gone for fear now it's the balkan operator from warzone it's my favorite operator oh snap i mean now he's a pretty cool model holy blacklist intelligence have provided us with all the documentation this is what we'll be up against the world is going to change it broke out oh my no spain how's bane doing here bounded by it i was born in the darkness oh my god cool environment i'm gonna riddle that thing full of m16 let me tell you this must be it i wouldn't do that it would be tragically poetic to come all this way simply to watch him die now it's over fontaine killing him won't help you do you see that that image the catalyst pulled from kavanaugh's mind is from a war that has not oh damn okay how valuable would it be to know how to win a war before it even began it's killing him yes but what is war without sacrifice upload complete this is only the beginning of global risks reckoning man can see the future i knew you'll be all right getting some cowboy paracetamol rob lucas aid wake up man roast dinner i'll be fine come on buddy in that order has to be in that order oh yeah it's me birds on the ground time to move we've got him let's go the plan was to not get shot remember yeah next time you're on point whatever advantage those visions of the future brought blacklist was a mystery we were taking home with us too this battle was over but the world is still an open wound we knew somehow we had to deal with these threats on the horizon we just didn't know how dangerously close that horizon was so that's the end of the first campaign operation catalyst [Music] thank you to all the wonderful developers that made that sir you need to check this out fontaine delivered [Music] what what is that the future future i could write it myself i could literally write it myself okay right so then if we go to play multiplayer we should be able to load the other campaign now most people said that the second campaign is actually better than the first so we'll see operation spectre it's loading a different engine the remedy used their own engine i think we managed to ascertain that earlier and the multiplayer is on unreal what do you think so far that first campaign okay are we gonna get to play as that guy now like in the future is that what's gonna happen an elite blacklist team infiltrates the speed and train on its way to global risk hq i'll give that first campaign like a 5 out of 10. like it felt like it was from 10 years ago i mean interesting story but we'll see where it goes oh we're just in straight away okay [Music] it's the same guns isn't it it's pretty crazy whatever's happening here it just dropped you onto the train just boom and you go there you go my whole team's down that's new that's new it's a vector a super five they call it and there's a shotgun there as well so we do have new guns remember the target has classified blacklist intel he cannot reach global risk oh tank rare fires mad on that oh the collectibles like a little tiger now instead this feels like the start of battlefield 3. please explode okay is that something new as well mar1 yes [Music] now hmm what they call that a key that's what they call it i'd like to use it though it just deselected it for some reason we're outside okay isn't that the guy from deus ex the voice he's in the expanse as well i hate it when they don't die on the floor like that's a grenade blow yourself up it does sound like the guy from deus ex can i get that we're getting stuck on stuff there's a little tiger in here so much spread on that jeez oh man [Music] i destroyed somebody's barbecue there they were just selling some hot dogs come over here mate banging at the club what's kevin on status they're taking him to an extraction lab on the other side why do they need a lab for a debris someone didn't read the intel the catalyst supercomputer placed data straight into cabinets head we downloaded our own copy from cavanagh before he escaped obviously yeah that is the deus ex guy yellow stuff equals jump on every time i jump on something it deselects my so what's in this images you always get the easy jobs maybe it's not him maybe it's just someone imitating i just noticed it slows the music down as well ruined oh you can shoot those big red things of course you can is [Music] now show me kevin has already reached the data extraction lab see that technician at the terminal that's sonya one of global risk's best and brightest holy talk to me coral what are you seeing it's then let's just analyze them first problem [Music] now get me up there so i can eliminate kavanagh and his intel i'll get you one for christmas they cut the power they know you're there okay look up there should be an access panel this guy just shoots everything well i am this guy so i just shoot everything you're too kind i know axe okay i'm in welcome to global risk operations hq don't forget to stop by the gift shop oh oh i was about to say sometimes the ai is really dumb and just like hides behind pillars in front of you but then three of them bust out the door right next to me i did not expect that suck on that wee bodies flying everywhere i don't know why they always announced that they're reloading as well put a grenade in there grenades a little grenade hello reach go go [Music] i really hope that they like give me different superpowers and it's not just slow motion for the entire game i want to play as the guy in the suit you know let me do that oh ammo i literally just picked some up cool try this shotgun not great maybe i was just aiming badly now any recall there's a bit i mean there's a lot of spread though uh like the spreads really weird when you're shooting people at distance it just feels like sometimes you're hitting nothing he's here get this door open now yelling doesn't help bulletproof way pack it there go too late they downloaded the intel and kevin is on the move again no if the intel's as dangerous as you said i need to destroy it first track kavanagh why i plant charges on the servers have i played the original crossfire yeah i have ages ago i did a video on uh three or four years ago because i mean they claim the player numbers it's actually the most popular fps in the world because of russia and asia like more players than like counter-strike and everything really going after the numbers it was just like um a clone of counter-strike back in the day and there's literally a map that is just too but they've just not called it just to i just ripped it off risk reinforcement the reason it was so popular is because it would run on any pc and it was free negative this is our mission and we're gonna see it through just tell me what i'm walking into but the single player is made by remedy it's different you're going to need a way out of there when that building blows some nice lighting in the game i'd love to play this on pc with nice graphics though i mean i feel like uh i'm making ready for the dunk [Music] drones hello [Applause] now [Music] it's got the classic dunk noise very good whoa just came out today this game or not yeah jack it came out today the first campaign which i've just finished is free for game pass i think it might be free for everyone i don't know please correct me if i'm wrong but it's definitely on game pass but the one that i play now i think you have to pay for oh okay i didn't realize there was a impenetrable sheet of glass in front of me [Music] multiplayer is free yeah kevin take him out i'm just i just wanted to play this because it's remedy i like their games i think it's their first fps campaign they've done [Music] exactly the way a soldier should die that's got a lightsaber i think they probably built this durian covered as well probably a made from home game they got the catalyst intel then we plan our next move luckily i know where they'll be i think you can tell with a lot of the dialogue as well that it's been recorded on different microphones and stuff in different environments [Music] luis torres back again thieves usually try harder to get away maybe you like our little prison eh love about president dude missed your friends i don't have any friends in there you don't have any out here either you know your mother she was a good woman are you gonna talk the whole time i'm trying to give you advice it looks like nightwing from titles is not the same actor hey people like you reach dead ends is that what you want huh hello it's an amazon drone jeffrey bezos oh man uh want him [Music] not stealth gameplay targets [Music] [Music] fast shhh here i can't stay here [Music] but there's a way through up there it looks like the house from encanto oh come on dice unibelle attention all residents of puerto helena or the swordfish a hurricane warning is in effect we invite you to prepare for hurricane conditions for your own safety please remain indoors global risk will protect you sneak past undetected guys the yellow thing come on we know that we can climb yellow things encounter with guns [Music] they spawn me i'm dead i don't know if i'm going the right way here but i'm going to assume it is no no if they spot me can i not just shoot them boys still a better love story than angel on the foul angel of falcon they're not romantic slide into the into the wall there must hurt the knees i do worry about the knees of all the operators in war zone they must be shot man they're gonna have really bad arthritis when they're older a giant rat from earlier no i'll sprays again the hospital good place to hide as any hurricane hurricane procedures are in effect please evacuate the hospital yes 55 oh my goodness see a friend i think he's a friend okay thought so come on it's like an acwr to stick this gun feels like it's got a faster rate of fire than the one i had earlier i'm sure it was the same mri scanner they put a lot of detail into these environments surprised clothes are everywhere can you please try not to get shot that's straight out modern warfare animation this way i'm the guy in the lead bro you need to catch up it's clear look i'm gonna wait for the scripting to catch up michael b jordan i don't think it's michael b jordan shawn no hold up yeah we're playing on performance mode i can show you guys um quality mode it's 30 fps though so like it just feels and looks horrible i don't want to really play the game like that you can probably tell that's really bad on the stream okay get ready i think it's rendering getting nate look at this oh god there's a lot more input lag as well it's not for me nope much prefer the frames per second way better it looks like native 4k 30fps maybe like a little lower than 30 at times why do you care what happens to me you got it all wrong my boss cares me i don't give two shits screw you yeah more did i just start all that ai seemed like it was startled nicholas kamara just tell me what the hell is going on i already did global wars thinks you're a threat personally i don't think the difficulty level would change the ai fatal dragon it will just change the damage that they do to you and probably the damage that you do to them give us your opinion oh my god true lies is it almost horse  jamie lee curtis that's an f35 isn't it did you see that story about the us losing an f-35 in the south china sea and they're worried that the chinese military are going to try and salvage it because the f-35 is like one of the most secretive jets out there in terms of how it's made and the technology on it and the materials it's made of so i think they're having a race to try and like salvage it or they're going to see if the chinese military try and get it it's really interesting all i've got is a knife a knife you just saw me i think i'm gonna die guys god i can't believe i made that they're still looking for me i need to get out of here hey chicky what's up man some of the environments are quite nice like the lighting here is good yes i'm never going to collect all of those but everyone who finds a win building's on fire perfect i gotta get out of here well i got a big gun i can't find [Music] be your guy come it we're right out of here thanks but i think i'll get a cab hey you can't have too funny can i play as that lady it ruins the dynamics where's the tornado it's bf 2042. monday get me out of town i can go alone from there sorry we have orders to protect you at any cost why you wouldn't believe me we got company she's british damn it bottle of water that would have been a cool thumbnail [Music] i feel like if i just did nothing here i'd still win maybe not that bit oh hello bye have a great time a big truck is like that whole section there that's just like a trope of early like 2000 to 2010 fps game design just feel like people have moved on you know on rail sections like that phoenix 39er inbound with wounded operatives one in critical condition need med base prep for arrival i'd like to play as the crisis guy come on please did you even shoot i shot a grenade skyler at the floor and it just exploded the gas can it's no secret that i strongly condemn the vicious attack on the town of puerto helen by the terrorist organization i have a cousin that looks exactly like that it's really weird hey kid take it easy you're in blacklist headquarters it's torres right funny i knew your mother a long time ago she was a hell of a soldier even if she did fight for the wrong side maybe it is the deus ex guy i can't tell because it could just be someone doing an impression it's not safe out there for you global risk is i never did anything to them ah it must be it sounds like him it's not maddox wants you dead and he won't stop until he succeeds sorry but that's a fact before you decide anything come here the situation from someone who can explain it better than me luis torres first arrested at age 11 for theft lived in foster homes since his mother died at age who the hell do you think you are i'm your second chance a chance to become more than your past she's a bit more french now i don't that you don't know anything about me lady you couldn't be more wrong is it the same character i can't tell global risk has two medics didn't raid your town to kill some petty thief he's scared of what you will become he's scared of the weapon he will become the ghost no no screw you and your slideshow i'm gone didn't you wonder how you survived that crash you have special blood i injected you with an experimental time it's repaired the damage but it's quite unstable and you'll be dead in a matter of weeks assuming that is we don't stabilize it first fox diamond how dare you put something you don't know us i get that but this is a chance to do something meaningful don't tell me you've never wanted that i'm with you until i get fixed then i'm gone so how do i get fixed we'll get to that first we need to find you something to wear and show you how it is the same character because it's the same name fontaine but i'm sure in the first game she was had a british accent and now she's french from the global risk base this powerful energy source will both stabilize the nanodyne inside torres and provide a valuable resource against maddox in the coming war torres may have refused to become a ghost but he'll assist us in this mission it's crucial the eoe is brought here for the operation the eores are kept in a secure role except for when they're being created [Applause] i'm gonna do an air drop [Music] oh sundance already didn't get any cut scenes like this in the first campaign can you slide yeah you can self i like his outfit that's a new gun mtr tours and i will head to the eo cora find the relay station and disable the electricity for us nicholas watcher six the rookie is gonna get us killed screw you man no sir he's not half bad squad lock it up and move out okay kid i got your six jensen is his name isn't it and desex is your boss he just goes all the time we're not buddies as i said he was in the expanse as well but he actually did act in the expense which was very unusual i got you kid i had it i know you did get down i'm the one that's doing the killing here logan i'm significantly better at it than you are this gun's got no recall on it can i shoot it down i wanted to shoot down the helicopter please logan on the side of the dam there's a mission in bf4 like this as well isn't that what the hell oh it's a drone i'm sure i didn't see a enemy soldier there's a drone just annihilating me please let me drive the tank at some point i'd love that do i have a secondary oh it's a burst pistol [Music] hey we need [Music] iron wants me to go in here i wasn't sure if it was saying go across to the other tower first or just go behind uh of course there's a sniper that's a scar cool it's better one more see look at the spread on the gun so weird just hit nothing most of the time why do these guys not die oh no there you go we did it guys hog advance down the dam get a blade i have to admit this second campaign isn't really uh doing it for me any more than the first one was so far at least gameplay is quite similar i'm at the relay station but nicholas and i got split up i think we should have bought nicholas can handle himself stick to semi-auto that's a good point stick to the mission [Music] yeah it does seem like there's less spread with the semi auto got the other side of these transformers he's got a shield can i pick up the shield no it's like five of those bullets just didn't hit right now you get them in the trap and they go down one hit bye too easy i can't be get up look at this got a shield and i'll take the ride interesting waiting for us a little bit late catch you reloading how does your boss know my future um you're some kind of fortune teller it's half two in the morning for me yeah but i mean i don't have anything to do tomorrow morning i've got to do something in the afternoon though i've got to prepare a video because there's an embargo tomorrow that's really interesting it's locked up lasers really are you ruined now you call that hacky listen you need to turn off the security system and faster is better i kind of have a thing about lasers oh yeah what kind of thing i kind of hate everything about that the sexy thing with the lasers no okay [Applause] what do you want me to do looks like there's a control room all right okey-dokey big mom [Applause] see you later chaos thank you for coming [Music] oh a puzzle that was hard this is like resident evil i'm starting to understand your laser phobia there races are off is that better you need to get the on my way house i knew there'd be a tiger like a tiger hurry back down good luck at work  run x oh no i think he got some of that this is why he ends up in the suit isn't it was the ghost that's what she said [Music] [Music] bit of radiation never hurt anyone need backup i can't nicholas hold on we're on our way come on nicholas needs our help is this a new comedy fps genre no babylon i don't think it's supposed to be nicolas is dead come on this way what the hell happened to the eoe back there don't know sciente might do it but right now we need to focus on saving our team they're not my team [Music] the new guy he doesn't even know him yet nice shiny arms you blacklist always forget how outlast is it gone with the lightsaber again tell me what's it like being an endangered species what's it like being a sociopathic prick take him to the prison to await execution the rest of you search the area rats never travel alone ah mission is a bust we need to rescue nicholas what no i need to get an eoey to fix it i know we're here see if you can get that it's aliens now logan he'll logan all right i'll tell you this is taurus everyone's been caught and the eoe was destroyed what should i do damn it you need to find another earring it's the key but maddox is going to execute that focus on the mission your life depends on it remember yeah yeah i remember i'm i thought i could interact with it or something well that was easy you said global risk have more eos in a vault right where is it it's in their rng departments on the upper floors the security come here tigers i'm a thief remember besides i always did work better alone guys don't laugh at me i'm sorry it's late i'm tired i didn't realize that it would kill me i feel like it's obligatory to use my slow-mo to kill those things because they're so annoying to aim at on controller i'm gonna try this bad boy out the shield you get the shielding multiplier i don't remember if it's in multiplayer why do they always put the trip mines in an obvious place where you can see them and shoot them oh maybe i should have grenaded that instead [Music] what oh there we go hitbox wasn't correct that's the limits of the shield now how good is it he's pretty good i think i actually tanked a load of damage there hard to tell [Music] i'm amber oh hit him with a shield bash okay well that barely does any damage at all in most games a shield bash is a one-hit kill isn't it [Music] okay i might need to shoot this sniper hello hello dice dice and figure out a please no you can't turn up the fov smacks i don't think there's any way to do that in the options that's all you got it's console games so you can't really change that stuff some console games allow you to do it but not many but i can't look at that it actually hurts my eyes fontaine cora is still out there i heard focus on the mission torres go to the upper floors however she used to be british i don't care well i'm done with the stream i'm gonna go and watch back the first campaign and she's gonna be british i guarantee how do i get that oh what the lighting bug yes like a dagger look at that pain oh big open area almost there this feels very similar to the last levels in the previous campaign good brag doll there i hate you so much no tossing grenade naughty give him a hot melee there picking up something just ahead of you stay sharp i'm not shocking for the sniper no mar1 this is why xbox bought cod damon you know xbox has said that they're not gonna make card an exclusive for the current agreement and into the future i see a massive energy [Applause] [Music] they gave me some cover you can't hear me now can you maybe you can [Music] we did it was that a boss fight it works then we'll get you back to base release i mean this looks straight at the end of metal gear solid 4. when snake has to crawl through the radiation you guys know what i'm talking about i've been eavesdropping on your team ever since in fact there is no cure because there is no disease [Music] need to look at the voice actors you lied to me the eoe won't fix the tech you put inside me will it phantom french for ghosts i'm going to kill maddox that's the only way to get global wrist off my tail for good the sound proofing i'd like a room like this to record my videos in maybe a bit too big actually no i don't like the shield give me that tank just let me use the tank please thank you oh no but there's no room peace through bloodshed turn around i want you to see this i already have a boy are you seeing the future showed me everything i've seen everything i did although i didn't expect you to actually come you started all this i've seen what you have for breakfast lunch and dinner do you really think you could kill me on your own what he's a ninja and he's got a lightsaber you can't beat him i do so love getting my hands dirty war is like a symphony and you boy you are my opening sonata and after you're dead fontaine's base will burn ugh you could have saved him you know if you'd been the ghost this is gonna cause him to become the ghost he's gonna get his ass kicked and i have to save him by putting him in the ghost suit fontaine come in maddox is planning boom hey getting a good workout in it pizza hell out of pilates what's up if you haven't got anything useful out of him then he's scheduled for execution with the rest of those black lists come later today matic said he stole an eoe find it is that guy that just walked away not hear the gunshot it was literally 10 feet away no okay what's up man yeah it's like the editing's just it's not very good hard to follow what's actually going on i gotta get out of here it's like there's no takedown animations or [Music] anything expect like a takedown animation there wouldn't [Music] something sometimes they don't react to the grenades either they just don't do anything i'm gonna flank these maybe yeah sweep the legs whoa in the caves my bro just despawned how deep underground is this place deep underground i'm not i'm gonna play alden ring on pc dude i might as well make the most of my pc right so i'll just use a controller though i'll probably use ps5 controller play on pc so i've got good frames although i saw some people saying today that it was limited to 60 on pc but i don't i don't know if that's true when i played it last week it was like a stream thing so you know i couldn't really tell it was just camped at 60fps [Music] they used a system called shadow which is kind of like geforce now where you you know you play a stream connect to a remote computer and then play that i mean i'm sure that if it is come to 60 it'll be a day before it's modded and someone figures out how to unlock the frame rate on alden ring i don't know though hopefully it's a good pc version if not i'll play on ps5 i'm gonna cause a cave in or something now get a grenade in there i'm iggy grenadine m249 again i've seen that for a while i wonder if steam deck would like be able to run out and ring i doubt it i mean maybe at like 720p my steam deck should be coming soon though maybe by the end of the month i hope so finally i think you could probably stream it on steam deck if it uses like geforce now or something fastest way to logan sell us through the aircon yeah can't pick that gun this is a big aircon system according to the map this pipe should lead me through the vents oh damn big elevator okay the open cell should be close the enemies down there nope [Applause] logan hold on why was it just open from the outside surely it should have been locked i didn't think i'd see you again kid yeah well i owed you one listen mattis is launching an attack against blacklist we gotta hurry you go for nicholas i'll get corey good plan you go ahead i need a minute to catch my breath suit yourself old man he's fine kid he's getting lippy now the kid it's got to be this way right let's get in there what are some more cells down there but i thought no it's not gonna be that easy is it maybe yeah i jumped the gun just opened up there's all these noises about do i know free to play multiplayer will come to pc i don't know i don't think so guns about boss fight is it i mean just a lot of enemy soldiers that's got pubg helm i did it dad are you proud of me no son never mom no never [Music] i mean crossfire has been on pc for like 15 years or something it's like a really old version of it so i've never had that i don't know i don't think crossfire x is going to come out on pc i feel like it's an xbox only thing i don't think they're going to make a version of this for pc though maybe they will who knows it's just open could have just opened it cora was open the whole time you escaped yeah and i got the eoe now we gotta go here the story is confusing yeah is bashar who knows what's going on at this point i can see the future the main character just got shot and he's going to become the ghost i even overloaded the eoe so you wouldn't get it betrayal but you're slow damn stubborn i saw the catalyst data before fontaine classified it i saw what she's hiding the eoe will turn you into the ghost and the ghost will destroy the world what no i wouldn't do that it wouldn't be you becoming the ghost changes you eventually there would only be a weapon i'm sorry louise i really am logan taurus is down i killed him i had to i'm sorry i won't be coming back i had to pay that price goodbye now do we get to play a level as the ghost please just give me some special abilities or something i i was chill fontaine's nanodyne took care of the bullet holes whoa so if you have nanodyne you can just survive being killed we know she told us before she bolted shit's all fubar attention four blacklist presidents have escaped yourself and it's only getting worse so you let it fail i think we're nearly at the end here the eoe will turn me into the ghost that's why you brought me here on this mission because your damn catalyst told you to hey i didn't know i went on a mission for my team end of story it's a need to know basis even if i did i don't buy all that catalyst fake we do what we do for our comrades our family then why'd you come back for me you and i aren't family here we are keeps having figured that out yet what now if you're done being dramatic logan's at the hanger finding us arriving i'm so confused there'll be a  ton of global risk between us and him so pick a weapon oh revolver why not this is just all the weapons in the game it's a blue scar what else we got shotgun vector grenade launcher hello uh [Music] boom okay i'm already kind of bored of the revolver i like the grenade launcher though i feel like this campaign's a lot easier than the last one i wonder why the weapons they give you or something else [Music] maybe the enemies on this stuff [Music] what one shot one kill for the revolver it does feel like it yeah this is the most powerful handgun in the world i missed metal gear solid what's gonna happen to it do you think i'll ever come back i mean kojima's obviously not there anymore i think is it konami have the license it'd have to be the right studio though wouldn't it like can you do metal gear solid without kojima i don't know i don't think he can [Music] there's been rumors of a uh a remake for years now a next-gen remake of the original metal gear solid like i'd love that so much if they did it well oh my god i mean they already did kind of do a remake of metal gear solid on the gamecube it was called twin snakes but by today's standards you know it doesn't doesn't hold up but it was good it's just a guy here not shooting at me man i love that they did a co-op game didn't they that was just crap i mean that was after kojima left yeah the remake is supposed to be made by bluepoint who did the demon souls remake and that was very i good that was the same dev team blacklist command come in lucky's put it on welcome back from the dead kid i like the new one it's the ghost you're starting to look like a soldier i know how to become the ghost what but cory said it would change me eventually i wouldn't be taurus anymore and those are my options maddox why is he referring to himself in the third person there i don't buy that in blacklist we make our own path we protect our own and i'll protect you no such thing yeah it was a zombie survival game like yeah just wasn't very good so i'm guessing that this is the last mission now we're gonna get to blaze the ghost this is stay down kid i got this dead that was like the worst death ever for logan he's gone as well oh it's crisis enhance the muscle tissue strengthen the fiber harden the bones maximum strength oh he's got stealth mode as well okay okay okay okay okay please don't just be a cutscene let me play this it's like i like music okay so we do flat this ends double jump well just like that he's gone is he [Music] we need to get the defense system online good call you'll need to reach the base controls his entire personality is gone will be impossible [Music] i'm a ninja shadow warrior nice runway [Music] [Music] i'd like a bigger field of view for this i think that would be a bit more comfortable for me it's cooler even the odds oh you're friendly sorry i'm trying to kill you no big deal ow get over the gate guys it's not yellow how would i have known sensitivity goes crazy there because they don't have the yellow thing on there it's weird some of them do some that don't what are we doing lads just gonna start there okay find the defense controls skulking around events again long way down yep dead if you go down there can i do wall runs at least no i see 13 pathetic and there's 55 to collect hurry why can you hear him breathing so loudly as well i just noticed asmr yeah you're right i thought that was my car alarm going off outside system activating hell yeah you are fontaine's final hope the ghost it changes nothing i am the future this world needs my vision will not be denied now i can help us [Music] [Music] free of any that will challenge my peace [Applause] leroy jenkins come and find me you vermin don't understand destiny chose me to save this world and i will see it done i'll kill you again if i must boy we've never met [Music] [Applause] you don't even get to fight him it's just a cutscene you kidding we both died for our beliefs where's my boss fight windsor reporting in i don't even get a boss fight i couldn't stop the ghost from being created i sacrificed everything to stop it my family my life that it wasn't enough blacklist may have been saved today but it doesn't matter this feud with global risk is pointless now soon the entire world will burn all because of him so the magazine [Music] torres you're still alive that won't save you this is multiple versions of it [Music] operation inspector there it is um 5 out of 10 again this feels like a game from 2006. [Music] interesting um it's remedy's first attempt a first person shooter single player campaign um i just felt like some of the gameplay was just kind of very old and archaic you know um the story was a bit confusing as well that's the second one at the moment that's all there is in the game the first one and the second one um i don't know if they're intending to add more so if i switch to multiplayer i can show you what it looks like i assume that they're going to add more based on that ending because that's only what like three hours and 30 minutes we've we've done that in our normal difficulty um so i assume they're going to add more because if you load crossfire x this is like the free version you can see those two levels those two campaigns i just did were here catalyst inspector so i think they're just going to add more i hope so well yeah there it is across rx let me know your thoughts guys i got to get off the bed because it's like 20 30 in the morning and i shouldn't have stayed up this late but i appreciate you guys all being here tuning in watching if you watched it as a life thank you if you're watching it as a vod cheers and do consider leaving a like and if you're new subscribe here with that said i'm off i'll catch you guys later take care of yourselves take care of each other have a good one bye
