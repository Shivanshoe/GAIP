out of the 30 or so cold war weapons that have just been added to war zone there's only really a few that have caught my attention as competitive options the mach 10 the ffar the type 63 and the krieg are the standouts for me so far and that might change depending on how quick i can max out the other guns and test attachments on them but today we're focusing on the creak it's a pretty decent assault rifle by all accounts and it can go toe to toe with a lot of the meta assault rifles right now i haven't settled on a build for it yet though because i haven't unlocked everything but i will update you guys as soon as i do also the kilo and the doof doof did get a bit of a nerf yesterday so their effectiveness has definitely dropped a bit so i'm playing here today with study westy and lachlan these are two incredibly competitive matches where we had a hard time in both of them but they are chock full of action and i thought that they showcased how effective the creed can be if you hang back a bit and play those angles there's also some tasty hdr shots in here too so i hope you guys enjoyed this as always a massive thank you to all of these legends using my code in the cod store i appreciate you guys and if you liked the video leave a like let's do this i hate wars and sometimes every death you're questioning whether they're a cheater what you do is you plug your controller in and um never have to worry about it again oh my god he just attacked me out of nowhere i've got two guys pushing me yeah it's healing the only way to avoid cheaters is own console and turn off crosstalk beautiful where's stud one down oh what uh there's another one there i think oh miami in the window come across i might get beamed i've got no plates jack yeah no place on me back out yeah if we can i'm getting in this building there's still some in the ikea ikea yeah sorry this uh i don't know why i call that build it's just because it's blue there's a guy in there do we jump down
