i will get across this bridge it's the last thing that i do we need to get to that objective ow it's totally not fair look at the ball there three of them well you know what i'm gonna switch to engineer i've got a s'more mtar yeah that's fine i shoot a rocket like here is that good i hate it's good for one there's another one there though wasn't there that's good for another one that was gonna kill me nothing i'm running out of walls to blow up about that one one two oh we got the double kill is that one no oh they're firing rockets back now no no more okay well that was good guys i hope you're all doing well today back on battlefield 3. i felt really nostalgic today i don't know what it was i jumped onto a server earlier playing on rush rush in bet3 was just chef's kiss so good some of the maps were brilliant well designed felt like a lot of thought had gone into it but just really fun to go back and play this game of course i strapped myself with that m16 a3 just to get the true the true bf3 feels and man the gun playing this game doesn't get old something's suppression oh awful can't stand it the movement's quite clunky as well at times but they just absolutely nailed the gunplay in this game it's brilliant so damn good but guys what's the date today it's the 30th of may you know what that means next week it's june it is june it's nearly time i've got a massive smile on my face guys battlefield the next game is set to be revealed in june we don't know exactly when but we know that ea play is in july so it could be sooner than you think and all the rumors and speculation point to the new battlefield game being a modern or near future setting and if that's the case well dice haven't made a modern shooter since bf4 and that released october 2013. we've had hardline some people consider that a spin-off rather than like a main battlefield game bf1 bf5 and this new game if it is modern i just remember the hype for battlefield 3 man i that's so it was so hype back in the day and as soon as they show something official and release some information about this new game i'm gonna be pretty excited firstly yeah just as a battlefield fan and i've played all the games since bf 1942 i used to go to lan events in london when i was a tiny teenager and we would play bf 1942 and then the desert combat mod at lan events it's where i met most of my friends i still play games with today so the prospect of a new modern battlefield game built for next gen new frostbite engine that makes me really giddy that's the first part of it but the second part also has a content creator this could open up so many possibilities in terms of videos and live streams i think the next few years are going to be good also it gives other people new people a chance to grow themselves a following as a content creator the world has changed so much in the last couple years for online video creation especially in the gaming space you've got stuff like shorts youtube tick tock twitch streams facebook gaming even creating video clips for twitter there's so many opportunities now so i would say to you when there's a new big game on the horizon and you like making content creating it for fun trying to entertain people educate them whatever it might be there will be a big opportunity with the next battlefield game so don't miss out on that if that's something that you've dreamed of or aspired to do for me it's coming up on 10 years of creating content on youtube i started this october 2011 so perhaps maybe by the time the new battlefield game is out i'll have been doing this for an entire decade and that's just a bit crazy for me to think about the fact that you guys tune in you still watch my stuff like it share it talk about it whatever it might be i'm proud of the community that we've got here i think you guys are awesome honestly i'm so humbled by that some of you guys may have been here since october 2011 maybe you joined with bf4 bf1 battlefront warzone pubg daisy whatever it is i'm sure a lot of the ogs are still watching today and i'm so thankful to everyone really for just being here still i was taking a look at some of my numbers recently over the last few months and i'm really happy with how the channel is going at the moment just to give you guys a bit of insight you can find these stats if you know the right places to look but the last five months or so of my channel have been really great for me in terms of consistency youtube gives you a nice breakdown of how many views your channel got between a certain period of time or just you can summarize it within a month in november last year we got 24.7 million views in december we got 20.2 pretty good for christmas time january we clocked up 21.1 february was 20.1 million march was 23.4 million and april was 25.1 million so there's been generally just some great growth across the channel recently and i think a lot of that is down to warzone although recently the war zone views has definitely dropped off a bit and i just think people are naturally getting bored of the game and as i said in my previous warzone video perhaps the new map they released wasn't quite enough to get people to come back and keep on playing the game but i love the fact that i can still make battlefield commentaries on any of the older games and you guys will always tune in and of course covering some of the new games like far cry 6 resident evil village which i really enjoyed doing that walkthrough and you guys have told me you really liked it as well and even the more hardcore stuff like hell let loose or hunt showdown i know those videos are never going to be incredibly popular but there's a dedicated viewer base there that wants to watch them so i will always make that type of content and i understand that those viewing numbers that i just showed you are minuscule compared to other gaming creators on the platform there are people who just dwarf and eclipse those kind of numbers that's fine but i've got my own little bubble here you know i'm happy and i'll always strive to create quality gaming content whether it's news information tips tricks just funny or epic gameplay moments whatever it might be and i'm happy with that and i love the fact that i can do variety on this channel and viewers will still turn up that's incredible you know we recently did that warzone year one poster too i don't really do much merchandise but that was the most successful one that we've ever done so many people bought it and then bought a frame and then went to the effort of actually hanging it up in their houses in their offices bedrooms some even in the living rooms apparently it's just awesome to see that and it really does put a massive smile on my face i don't know this might come across as a bit of a weird video to some but i just wanted to say this stuff and say thank you i'm feeling a bit reflective today looking back at some stuff and i'm happy right now i'm in a good place i hope that you are too i think we've got a lot to look forward to over summer as well and it feels like the world is starting to get back to normal now which is good it's really good with that said guys i'm going to leave it there i hope you enjoyed the retro bf3 gameplay bit of m16 bit of mtar as well ripping it up on sand crossing rush as i said i hope you guys are in a good place look after yourselves look after each other if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
