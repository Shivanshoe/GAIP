just a few moments ago we got a massive update on the call of duty warzone anti-cheat called ricochet and this is a juicy post that goes into a ton of information and confirms something that's been theorized in the community for the last month or so and it's a way of messing with cheaters collecting data on them and ensuring that the game stays as cheap free as possible following that i've also got an absolutely nuts game of warzone using the car 98 from vanguard there's some great snipes in there and we had an absolutely wild finish in capital it's a good game i hope you guys like it now then this anti-cheat stuff so they posted a blog and we're going to take a look at it now and i'm going to show you an example of what this looks like so first up we're going to take a look at a clip from tim the tatman here he was playing with dr disrespect and he realized that there was a cheater in the server and this specific thing had happened to them this guy's somewhere i don't know i can't dude what are we testing he's cheating and he can't do damage he's cheating what's that look at your health you haven't seen this yet see my health this kid's cheating this is actually one of the funniest ways they troll hackers it's the kid on the buy i'm flying at him it's not working huh buddy rat so if you didn't realize there the ricochet antique has detected that the player that they killed was cheating and nerfed the damage of their bullets and if you frequent social media you watch youtube videos streamers you may have seen this a few times already where people come up against cheetahs and the cheetah will hit them like 30 to 60 times and it does barely any damage and i've also seen a few clips from cheetah's perspectives so i know what it looks like from their point of view as well and a lot of people theorized about what this could be and in this blog from call of duty we finally know so this is what it says data collection and mitigation ricochet anti-cheat relies on data to identify cheating behavior and make our bandwagons more impactful as we collect data from machines determined to be cheating our goal is to ensure that they aren't taking wins from our deserving community team ricochet also uses several in-game mitigations to reduce the impact of cheating players beyond banning accounts one mitigation technique we've been testing is something we call damage shield when the server detects a cheater is tampering with the game in real time it disables the cheater's ability to inflict critical damage on other players this mitigation leaves the cheetah vulnerable to real players and allows team ricochet to collect information about cheetah's system we track these encounters to ensure that there is no possibility for the game to apply a damage shield randomly or by accident no matter the skill level to be clear we will never interfere in gunfights between law abiding community members damage shield is now out of testing and deployed across the globe this is only one of many mitigations we have in game with more live and in development since activating new mitigations in the last few weeks we've seen a decline in cheap reporting but we know the work is never done so they're calling this damage shield and as you saw in the tim the tatman clip what they described is what's happening here there's a cheetah in tim's lobby they've been identified as a cheat and in real time the anti-cheat applies a nerf to their damage and you could see on tim's health that it was barely going down when he was being hit repeatedly so they can just shoot the cheetah and in tim's case he got up behind did an execution so this essentially makes the player that's cheating unable to kill any other players in the game obviously for that cheetah that's going to be incredibly frustrating rightfully so they're breaking the rules and that definitely wouldn't be fun every single match that you go into you can't kill people and you would hope that after the anti-cheaters collected the information on them learnt a bit more about how their specific cheap works it will ban them flag their hardware whatever it might be i think this is great because it's trolling the cheetahs in a way right and the fact that it can do it in real time too is very impressive and i think it's pretty smart that rather than just banning that person then and they're in the match which i'm sure that they do to some accounts it appears that with others they're applying this nerf to their guns collecting the information on them and then banning them afterwards it's a really interesting approach and i've seen discussion that they're actually putting more cheaters in lobbies together so you might think you're in a real game with legit players but you're actually just in a lobby that's full of 150 cheers and then ultimately you'll be banned but this at least proves it call of duty has come out and said yeah this is a thing it's called damage shield and it's part of the anti-cheat and we'll see how that evolves as the game continues let me know what you think down in the comments below now on to the match here as i mentioned car 98 owen gun this is the car 98 build we've been playing a lot of vanguard royale and that's mainly because things like stuns on in it dead silence stopping power also the new bomber which is kind of fun to mess around with and it's just a new pool of weapons to get into also no heartbeat center too which actually makes quite a big difference so here we go as always big thank you to all these guys using my code jack frags in the cod store appreciate you if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe if you're new let's do this where's he's done uh in the building he's coming out heavy armor push me yeah yeah
