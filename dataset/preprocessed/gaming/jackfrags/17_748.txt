hi everyone and welcome to a new episode of across the battlefield today we are on Solomon Islands now it's been a while it has been a hot minute since I've posted a bf5 video and really cuz I don't have this done there's just not been that much life in it you know the last couple weeks after Solomon Islands this map came out not much has happened like possible all the weapons are out already and they've just been fined over drip-feeding cosmetics I've just been controlling other games you know but I thought I'd hop back on tonight because soon like in a couple days I get this guy there we go soon we are gonna get the 6.2 patch which is almost a complete revert of the gun values did he oh he's right there he was hard to see sorry of the gun damage values not good values what does that even mean he's gonna get as good can I jump over this please so it's not a complete total Reaver like some of the guns are only where they say it makes sense we'll do a little less damage range I think but close to medium and long will feel a lot like it used to so that's coming soon I'm really looking forward to that but I'm also looking for a predator and I've heard that the most likely candidate is on the D side here plenty of enemies over there but no one has found this supposed predator Easter Egg yes the clues I'll just play the game so it's obviously orangey in one day it's er it's gonna happen to someone and hopefully they're recording Xbox record that and all that stuff but also coming up in the patch is tank customization finally there's a couple guys in here can we start with the sword Wow yes so tank customizations coming stop firing Young's mg boom that guy just exploded but they're actually put in that coming soon thank customization in the one that was at the end of the trailer there's a bit cheeky but I think all you've got to do to get that is login during a son like period of time but hopefully this LVT here isn't take me out okay but they killed I feel like I was on target then weird so yeah vehicle customization is coming I didn't want to do a video just on that because like they only showed like a few screenshots and it just I don't know like I'd rather check that out when it's actually in the game and that was difficult and I can experiment with it myself look at these pots here is this part of the Easter Egg shoot the pots now apparently there's no trigger for it whatever it is I don't know just gonna happen look I reckon DNA is strong candidate if we're gonna see a predator of some kind obviously it's not gonna be if it is a predator I don't I don't know where this came from if it is a predator they can't put the actual predator in the game camera right because it's intellectual property I can't believe I only got a killer sister I don't think dice have any right to that but it might be like sound effects or like a shimmer or something just like homage to the movie I suppose but it's not being discovered yet whatever it is so we'll have to wait and see I'm gonna get this guy oh no they're dead right I want to get more katana kills but there's no one around you need a good situation for that to work there's a rainbow what about Jack and that's predator mode if there's a rainbow in the sky you can get it was it is it just to look nice not everything has to be an easter egg does it it could be a nice bit of art design there well yeah that patch is out this week that was a way nose woman it came from the trees what if it's up in the trees such a nice look him up though isn't it this gorgeous mm-hmm there are some weird noises on this bar is it the parrots there's a lot of parents around but the map is kind of flipped here hasn't it we took their gimmies and they took ours let's have a look see it's gonna fire a random shot there did get attack I think that's their front line they're gonna be pushing from the I can't get a kill guys it's always countless Kel love that so the m2 carbine is pretty okay like it's not a terrible gun with the 5.0 with the 5.2 damage values but at range it does really suffer I just like how fast it fire zone looks cool isn't it look at it it's nice they still hold up there no I think we got it someone hiding there here's thanked and it's gone one shot from the bazooka did the job that some hide in there it feels weird because I haven't really played battlefield 4 it's more than a week or something oh my god my tracking was completely off there thank you the res I can always jump right back into this game there oh that's cool back machine-gun fire just raining down on me from there no one on a I was someone over here maybe doing that um oh I wonder if this is shot here six pounder nothing try one more near a vehicle on the left I think I'd turn enough what was it that was it tank glancing blow disgusting how'd that guy no one else got friendlies on the right now so we should be good there no snipers here that's someone give me a shot please Ilsa would the gas mask on Jack frags are going to you must have played against him before it's a dead body hmm yeah this might be the young does this actually work it does work Wow look at that katana destroys those barbed wire yeah I was gonna say the this might be the last episode of across the battlefield for for a while battle 5 because I mean they haven't shown any of the Mac side they like does nothing come in where is this guy going he's off the beaten track here what are you doing Mudge 75 take me take me to the fight please move me always going across the bridge that's very clever but yeah I know there were some rumors about a like a water map in the Pacific content I'm gonna jump up it's an easy kill I think there we got it there's the one on the right there - what did I but yeah I did see some I was a sniper over here something is about a water map and speaking of water look at this waterfall yeah it's nice that feels like Easter Egg territory right there you can hear loads of people just gonna wait still have that katana what why did that guy just turn around was I spotted or something that was weird wasn't it I don't think I've got spotted maybe I did maybe the sniper spotted me when he hit me or something but that sucks I was on for a big katana kill streak there I think I would have been good game his boat yeah I was plenty of enemies up ahead and run and jump out music building there's a bear cover not about a foreign position really I'm a medic down he's dead it's my swimming here I think he's trying to find a crocodile I read the crocodile is called max as well good name for a crocodile that don't see it often they're out mmm not sure how to play this because I think there's a couple more now we've got friendlies over there now I'm moving no crocodile is that it nope I thought max was all over there there for a second enemies up ahead here yeah I just smoked for a rest and I made that weapon switch have to cancel the reload there chill for a second push sighing the dry as well as under he's seen me that he was killed cool first guy got the assist cancers kill make sure we fully loaded on the rim over there too you have to reload a lot with this thing not really been killed much by the time today either that's a terminator just walking forward with the LMG I think I had a footstep around here then yeah and the riot what all that angle is disgusting look at that I can barely see his head that is revolting that angle I'm gonna stick around for a reservoir squad mate medic near and I think they put smoke down there we go special thank you can I stand up Hey look they were right here peeking the handle hello or on the right okay I just want to get a kill everyone I start to shoot just gets killed by someone else more trees around here where the predator could be hiding is he in here no I don't want to climb in all right bars me out the way destroy those fortifications get the katana again thank you it's a bit more difficult to use on PC though this thing cuz I think people wear headsets you know you remember I did that video which was on PlayStation 4 where I only used the Jeep and the katana who hit me then so a tank over there c1 but yeah that katana Jeep video I think of this just like stuff like that is a lot easier just someone here there we go stuff like that it's a lot easier to do on console because I think most people are playing on TVs and they're not wearing headsets so like sound is such a big deal in this game right if you're on PC I reckon what 95% of people are going to be using a headset and the footsteps are so loud in this game that you can easily tell when someone is creeping look behind you whereas on a TV obviously all the sound is just coming from the TV unless you've got like an elaborate surround sound setup or something you don't really get that situational awareness so it's one behind me do you kill him yeah so it's a lot easier to creep up on people when you're playing on console it's not to say that you couldn't do it on PC but I think you need a lot of other sound effects going off at the same time Trog is a bit of chaos and then people maybe don't hear you come in behind them and then you can go on those crazy katana killstreaks I might do something like that like I might do something like that again though like a console video or something that yeah like I said I just haven't really I don't really have the urge to come back and play bf5 for a little while it needs like it needs a bit of a injection doesn't it it needs something it's a live service game and we're just been artillery like crazy here it's a live service game and I think like this chapter like they're showing us what's come in and it just feels really bad bones doesn't it it really does another pirate there it needs something needs a bit of life maybe some new game modes or mark sodomy I feel like they're all gonna come from here and I'm kind of on my own where it feels like I'm on my own just dude on the mini-map round here we could get yes no oh there it is tied to a barley that's gonna get nerve quite hard as well in the patch because if you think well if they revert most of the damage values back to what they were the type 2a is gonna kill people even faster than it does so I think they said they're gonna increase the recoil loads and change the damage a little bit I'm sure we'll still absolutely shred people at close range but I think like medium range like right now it's really easy to control the recall on it especially on PC but I think they're gonna vastly increase the recall and know if the damage at medium long ranges so you just can't hold people down like you can at the moment I would spell 'dirty using it but I'm gonna use that much to be honest there's a couple people there that was a good player that just went up familiar there is some one right here - we're gonna [ __ ] get around out there dead no enemies on the point it's on as shooting over here didn't connect to the head there and then on the right just didn't have any situational awareness then that he was there plenty friendlies around that I'll say thanks are you shooting up coming down here it's that clear looks like it well that guy just died so probably more around here somewhere no one going for that res I think we're good maybe I'm a little bit of a flank here see how many kills we can get before the round ends there's one there's another one someone on the left here oh this is nice probably take that how does a boat and I get the boat let's go bazooka yes I didn't think I was gonna get that he's a guy there hey there it is now we got a fair few kills there before the round ended GG I enjoyed that that was really fun how did we do in the end 36 and - not bad not bad at all well that was fun I enjoyed that Solomon Islands across the battlefield I hope you guys liked that and of course this week I will be covering the new stuff when I have a chance to but without said I hope you enjoyed this guys if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike make sure you look out for that predator subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
