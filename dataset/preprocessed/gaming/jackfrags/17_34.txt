okay so the boys have agreed to show me around this exhibition hall and apparently there's some really massive cool ships here i did play a bit earlier today but there was a lot of bugs so i'm expecting this to be a bit janky this stuff is all brand new to me but let's see what kind of trouble we can get up to see this thing over here this is going to be a real thing in the game a fauna what does that mean an animal it looks like a whale it's a space whale are they going to attack you or something well no it's a statue but no i know this isn't going to attack me well but but have a look at it though i say yeah does that does the front the mouth not look like jar jar binks a little bit it looks like a duck today space dog johnny is that you in the shower this is me no that's freeman that's very fancy i need a jacket though to complete oh look at that you look like um something from like detroit become human or hitman maybe try on this jacket that's very nice oh there's some guns here oh yeah it's just this is a weird shark um it's like it's sweet shopping and it's just wait i'm not sure what their demographic is here yeah it's hard to say isn't it really you get a nice burrito look at these peppers apples watermelon yeah do your groceries you know pick up your your fruit and veg later and then over here a wall of guns there's two ships here we can have a look at if you haven't seen them jacking i haven't seen anything here before well i think well let's have a look at the ships here then and then we'll go can we go to the expo this is uh crusader industries yeah they uh look at this is my favorite statue in the game oh that's nice and this is my favorite statue in the citadel it's like something out of a theme park that's good then i've got lights all the way down as well now there's this here jack i don't know press the button here and step back and step back and look at it okay did i do it yes oh yeah this is cool isn't it i haven't actually seen this before what is it i don't know it's like i i genuinely have no idea is that a cockpit what is it it's an escape pod maybe a life raft it's the cockpit of the c2 i thought it would expand a bit more than that what's this man what has this man got on his head that's not normal no that that's a is that a player well i think so well really i think i hope they wouldn't design any npcs like that let me tell you this this here is uh what you've been waiting for all your life oh that's the nuclear warhead yeah this does something as well doesn't it yeah how do you get that will uh you need the the a2 variant well how do i get that which i've already told you this jack i've got maybe like a sieve will okay that's the end game that's so cool crusader mercury star right now yeah this one is awesome this is the the millennium falcon essentially was that gun at the bottom oh yeah come up in here this is this is fantastic here's your your nice hangar you know you get any boxes in here you get a tank in here as well probably getting in there yeah we come up into the elevator lift here it's 4.9 million it's actually not that bad isn't it well not for you will you got the scanning room in here for you know scanning stuff what does it do i don't know i literally no idea let's go on this scan there but i think it's just scanning other things i don't think it's just scanning you scan me damn it we'll go to the forward section of the ship as well but we have the habitation area this is where you you know you live in space yeah uh including uh if i remember rightly there's your shower oh they've got some links in there yeah make sure you uh have a little look in here and there's a box looking thing at the base of the shower have a look at that is it storage or something oh that that's the toilet isn't it that's it that's your space toilet no we don't need to see oh god this is a bit much if i go over here and then lovely we can watch each other we can poop together jack i don't like it yeah then we've got the actual bridge here oh wow do you need two people to fly this or something well you can sit in the pilot seat for certain yeah oh chess space chess yeah so you can play space chess in here jack wait can you grab them all that's it okay i'm gonna grab that one don't inspect it oh dice hold on if i put it down there that's my move that's my first move okay right i think this is my first move i might have this right what are you doing oh god wait what did you do you i just put one of the chess pieces on this coaster it opens a secret smuggler's passageway jack so you put the queen on that and that opens that yeah the can i go in now you can go smuggle i mean this is formula falcon this smuggle all your budgies down there i mean it's even got the sofa like the curved sofa which is essentially millennium foundation it's quite really fun this is uh this is cool where does this go uh everywhere all over the ship it it opens up secret compartments pretty much everywhere so it's just an escape route i guess well everyone knows about it now not really secret anymore is it that concludes the tour look at this oh it's to the hangar cool yeah so you could escape i see it's a nice ship that is what why are there body bags here what the hell has happened here isn't it grim isn't it i don't think i want to go here to be honest this guy doesn't look too well hello i think they're dead wait that's the bartender every night but he was just downstairs look at this glass floor here i don't like this i won't go on these in real life i always feel like i'm going to be the unlucky one so this will take us to the expo then oh it's a shuttle rather than a train again we're flown in it's like bespin isn't it i've just realized we're in bespin yeah i'm such an idiot it's cloud city i don't know how to stand up why there you go look at that you got a nice face your character looks like drummer yeah that's where i made it by really you actually did absolutely not i took the first thing they gave me maybe there's just a preset that looks like drummer then how are these platforms floating uh gas gas yeah they've got engines that keep them up they like boost every now and then i think that is is meant to be like orbiting i guess but you can't notice it didn't fly that close to them trees we nearly crashed into that didn't we yeah that was close it's very dangerous i mean i mean this will not be approved by health and safety so is this expo center not normally here no okay no it's a special dog special event it's it's it's apparently moved between planets invictus launch week instinct in service oh look at this statue oh that's cool i didn't even notice a tribute to the naval rescue operations in vega time to step up what did they do look step [Music] and you too can stand on a rock i don't know what i'm signing up for here to be honest oh it's the gift shop i mean we should probably end here really i mean yeah you to exit through the gift shop we're spoiling it what the terminator with an ice cream ice cream that's very strange that's a player isn't it okay that's normal i need your clothes your boots and the flake with raspberry ripple sauce so do we go and see the ships here yes expo lobby in here uh no that looks like dim i don't want to get in there black yeah let's get this one let's try a different elevator what's this hollow man that's uh that's barry barry invictus decisions it's the royal tournament but in the star citizen i don't want to be recruited i mean we don't have to we can just steal the spaceship wow look at this coffee to go the vision center a.a spawn a a ballista is this a new ship then no this is the carrick it's been in the game for quite some time but it's a lovely ship it's very big so we'll just go in right you can you can re if you if you click on it you can actually rent it as well for 48 hours for free oh my god have you seen this crowd of people down here where are we talking look come back out look at this that's unusual are they on a tour i don't know they're just looking on the stairs and on your left is a staircase wait are they real no what real is in physical there's one there's three inside one there i don't see i don't see them in each other this is kind of weird they're all looking at their watches and just hanging about it's like real life isn't it yeah i've done this in real life don't you know just stand around on stairs in groups i like the lighting in here very laid-back conference chairs there's it's got a bit of an alien feel to it at this table i was about to say yeah it looks like alien i mean someone left food here as well if i lay back on this table it'd be popping out my women's stomach just burster oh i've got a toilet remember the last ship we went in look at this i've never seen the toilets this time bloody yeah look at those doors although i tell you you know hang on let's just no i eat there we go it's like you're being in a caravan or something you can't actually sit on those crackers i can't see you look at these nice folded towels i wonder if they're going to be bringing this the bed sheet simulation to these at some point dude that is an hd towel right there oh that that really is isn't it that's flat i feel like i could touch that why do we have no reflection with vampires jack space vampires it's morbid time okay we're about to depart is everyone seated comfortably i am seated in the secondary pilot scene this is amazing if you can actually fly from here because that's a great viewpoint isn't it can we take off please captain okay we are departing in three two one whoa whoa jolly's next to me when do the in-flight meal start why can't i get any movies on my screen yet third person views f4 isn't it it's an absolute joke i mean we're almost upside down adam we're on our way we're 90 degrees up if i get out the seat here johnny we're just going to fall attack you're asking me as if i have enough semblance of knowledge about it i'm doing it i need to test come on you eat me away let's go so that's the upper bridge then and that doesn't make sense come up to the upper bridge look at the angle we are well how are we walking around are we sticking we got mag boots yeah great it's gravity mate the gravity generators it's gravity mate he's dead easy come on in here are you serious well well does the ship have a gravity generator i'm explaining it away through products as usual what do you do well they go for the door you open the door no you can do that i've opened the door why won't you open it because i've got i'm typing the dance come on jack [Music] that's it it's that's that's all it does and then it stops [Laughter] how am i allowed in here by the way when we're in warp is this not clusters outside just that's fine isn't it really you're protected by the the there's nothing in there it's the shield who wants to come outside with me yeah i'll do it yeah becky i've got a helmet on one second yeah that might be a good idea here we go helmet on i've got my med gun at the ready to to save you it's so pretty we're standing on the deck of a carrier ship wow ah at warp i i advise not jumping is it hello you go on the side and everything just don't jump try not to jump i mean oh i've gone uh uh you jumped didn't you maybe can we come get you uh i don't know where i am i'll tell you what i'll kill myself then come pick me up hi adam thank you for picking me up i'm sorry i was an idiot is there a way that i can get in on the top there uh yeah oh my god i thought i've fallen over cargo bay this is not whenever i go near it just dude this is massive yeah what the hell this one's pretty big that's glass there i can't get in there that looks like a giant rail gun or something oh now once you're on board i can't really tell you where to go okay i'm sure we'll find our way are you in the command station or on the bridge i'm on the bridge right he's down a level johnny i'm going down wow i made it welcome to the bridge look at you this is so freaky look you just stood on some glass and then below you the vast and cold emptiness of space can we like go and do a bounty hunt mission or something like that okay accepting the contract eliminate the target how do i see the mission information is that my f1 yeah on tax manager yeah accepted a chance to impress eliminate chad andres how are we gonna possibly take out a chad i'm looking for any chats any giga chads around look for some muscly sharp jawed men yeah we are entering chad's last known position oh neutralized there he is the same okay ready to fire here we go bye chad yes it's the end of your sharp jawed muscley life no chad's dead 9 000 credits let's go crime committed how was that a crime i thought we were doing bounty hunting we were bounty hunting it said to kill chad yeah we did we'll be criminal i'm confused oh no i do have a crime stand now why i thought that was part of the mission interestingly enough i don't have a yeah because i'm the one that pulled the bloody trigger we're gonna have to go get one of those usb sticks now aren't we so i can clear my crime stop and we can do stuff right now that's a problem what's the wait problem that missile adam adam the fire missile's house yeah why wait it's because i'm a crime style isn't it yeah evade are they yeah i think it's because they don't like you because you're a criminal jack yeah but we killed chad it was part of the mission ah this is the problem it's a real big problem are you fighting i mean there's missiles there's no fighting these people we'll see i'm gonna take all the turrets out oh my god i think you hit it i didn't quite get the angle on that right maybe it's for the best i think so here wait am i gonna go to jail yeah i'm in jail and there's two feet sticking out the wall next to me [Laughter] that's most unusual look it's time for you to break out of prison how do i break out okay you're gonna go to where it says like the miners workers area mine is workers area okay i don't think i've ever been here before have i i'm in the main circle where are the guardians of the galaxy okay now somewhere it's just like workers minds or something oh yeah on the left work mine's got it go follow towards that as you're walking towards that on the right hand side keep an eye out because you're gonna see a security office of some description security office somewhere on the right side you're going to see an office oh yeah i say i say it yeah so go up to the windows of that office yeah hold f and like mouse wheel forward you should be able to zoom in and somewhere at the back on the wall there's a computer terminal with a four-digit codon keypad one passcode one two four five okay one two four five you're going to go back now to the main circle let's see the guardians of the galaxy again you should see a giant spinning fan off of the main circle on in the brick wall giant spinning fan in the brick wall yeah um in the middle of oh yeah i see that's it okay so you're gonna jump over to that jack i'm gonna do my big running jump okay i made it to the fan okay now somewhere near by the fan you're gonna see there's a pad it was one two four five right open and the fan has stopped do i go in yeah [Music] don't look back i mean i look back is that a problem [Music] so this is the full breakout from jail then yeah there's a spinning dog down there if i drop in that i'm dead yeah i wouldn't do that why did you end up in jail uh there was an incident in space okay all right so i'll just follow you then if you've done this before haven't you jump across right now i'm gonna walk around adam i can barely function in here you said something about following the blue flowers as well oh wow oh it's probably like covered in this is kind of scary okay i'm gonna mouse scroll down a little to go slower which should cause less jank jump up here yep i can't believe you can actually escape from jail what over here oh adam yeah that's a tricky one no that's the tricky one how do i get out what other ways are they out of jail uh you can work uh for the dog and do some mining or fix some machinery or wait how long do you have to wait depends how much crime you committed really yeah it was proportionate to whatever crime you committed well we killed chad i think that deserves a long sentence is this whole thing a janky jump puzzle adam oh oh this is nothing it's just the beginning is it just we are just getting started okay okay i'm down for a challenge pretty sure there's some blood on the walls here as well which is quite ominous there's a little bit of this hit i wonder what the backstory is for this then like who built this exit morgan freeman morgan freeman yeah why yeah the the space shank redemption oh oh it's pink here yeah oh no there's a hand sticking out it was a cave in with a ladle i feel like i'm in the matrix is it death if i fell here earth not death but it's not great oh there's stuff down there yeah we don't want to go down there trust me okay right right now what that blake right we're going to nail this don't worry how far through are we here then um we you know pretty far actually i don't yeah i nearly fell down then okay this is quite a big chasm here adam that's fine what does that say on the wall there no turning back okay here we go mirror's edge can i make that gap there you go onto this square platform underneath with the tree oh i nearly jumped a bit too far then so we need to get across there yeah now i don't advise doing it this way you can do it this way probably you know you've got to be a master of jank to pull it off no no no no no that's the alden ring that is who's that over there look at that barry that's barry from earlier right barry that's the beast barry he's fallen far does barry have anything inmate work helmet you can just steal the helmet can you i'll leave it on him it's his property you know let's consider how he did oh oh no another one another victim fell trying to escape go to hell krf who's the krf exit right oh this looks good adam so a ladder no but there's an absence of gravity okay i make no promises that we can survive this now jake oh no not lasers now come right to the left hand side of the wall i'd say here i'm prone yeah now i do consider myself a decent pilot but i'm not sure i'm going to find the hole in the picture like you're going to come down the hole and save us well i can't see anything can't you just put the lights on yeah but it's pitch black well we need you to pick us up and save us okay and now if we look in here jack on the wall yeah more passcodes okay i remember the bottom one you remember the top one okay seven seven eight two zero seven one six we're moving on oh well what's your eta uh dodging missiles in the dark that doesn't sound very promising wait how is will gonna get down here though how are we going to get on we'll ship jump sure that'll go swimmingly we need to get up this pipe adam here yep get over here jack right we're going to run around here now what are we looking for this orange bin on on the edge of this circle it's got a car in it oh i see go motor racing we could just die out here then well yeah this is pretty perilous hey i've got a survival estimate 9 minutes and 28 seconds what was the first coach zero seven one six that will try yours try try yours on this panel zero seven one six no try seven seven eight two seven seven eight two okay open the door open the ramp oh baby oh this is our escape vehicle look at this let's get out of here the two season oh yeah okay strap it in let's go get the lights on them i'm impressing you jack you're driving i'm driving oh yeah welcome to good idea so where do we have to go then um away we'll come and meet you will try and land if you can just some check everything's good away we go we're out there we need to find remag easier to drive in third person what is it it looks like the mako from mass effect or something yeah and let me tell you it handles like it oh my god it's not much gravity here is there no i hope i don't fall down a giant hole or something i mean it's not ruled out we are we're flying at him is that a good thing probably not i mean morgan freeman still has a solid there it really has hasn't he escaped and getaway vehicle have you ever won who's everybody wouldn't have to get that guy i'm trying to think of his name for it wait he's called man from sean chang redemption isn't he that's his name yeah i don't remember honestly tim robbins tim robbins baskin robbins that's it they'll do your solid escaping gel and also a nice ice cream i appreciate the look of concentration on your character's face as well i appreciate the look of nothing on yours i'm heading right for you now will okay 930 meters closing fast okay we made it finally okay i'm landing what's happened to the back of your ship i mean that's that splash you've taken some damage there will yeah i was getting blasted okay staying clear there's the ramp down at the back of that i'm gonna do a reverse and then we'll put it in oh okay we're in there like swimwear let's go baby all right i'm closing the door [Music] all right i'm taking off the great escape i've just teleported onto the roof it's now falling over you're on the roof please don't be dead i'm fine it's fine you're not you're not on the roof no no it's the greatest skateboard okay are we airborne yes good job everyone we did it well i tell you what what now jack oh okay i see what you're looking at there's a gun on the side of this go to the gun oh yes deploy heavy machine gun power on oh my god you could rinse people with this i'm sure i could damage the railgun there as well if i wanted to right what i can't use this ladder what the hell guys it won't it won't let me climb the ladder it's weird isn't it yeah yeah get out oh you want me to leave the ship and then come back and see if i can use the ladder okay you look so you look stupid come back here what do you want to do just get back in now get back on the ship yeah you're just floating in a standing position but let me show you how stupid that looked this is what it looked like does it do it for you as well oh yeah you just got your arms down by your side it must just be that suit isn't it does it do it for me as well no you look normal oh no oh no i'm gonna help me you idiot will are you dying he's quick he's quick on the sticks yeah okay okay yeah you don't have animations out i'm just floating around okay let me murder you and then revive you i just want to use the ladder wheel wait you think that killing me might fix it stand clear i i don't really know if i should headshot you is that safe to head shot probably go through the legs i'll shoot you in the balls not my plums say that oh that's the ball shot how's your health 74 all right stop stop moving around moving well i need i need a clear ball shot there we go i'm i can hear space noises someone shoot us get to the to the turret there's one here where is it i mean i'm going in oh my god are you kidding me what was that i don't know did someone come and bounty hunters because we were criminals that guess what we're not back in jail are we yeah oh no i'm gonna be in jail as well and that's the citizen why is there an arse in my face [Music] you
