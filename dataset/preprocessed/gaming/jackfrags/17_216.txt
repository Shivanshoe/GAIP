just now we've had a huge gameplay and info drop for battlefield 2042 we'll be taking a look at gameplay of the five remaining specialists ui updates changes that dice have made based on beta feedback and more so the video starts off with rao and rao is a recon class specialist from india and their abilities are based around hacking and the first one that we can see in the video here is called trojan network they hack an enemy player and if you kill a hacked enemy player it will actually highlight any of their teammates that are around or nearby you can see they take down the play there and then it highlights a couple people that are nearby in the vicinity the second ability is the cyber warfare suite and this allows them to hack enemy equipment and in-world objects so you can see an example here they hack the bollards they go down for a second teammates go through they come back up and the enemy transport gets stopped and meets an untimely demise to a rocket launcher next up is dozer and this was one of the first specialists that we got a good look at in the reveal trailer a dozer has the blast resistant trait which means that they're more resistant against grenades and explosive damage looks kind of similar to eod perhaps in call of duty and their unique gadget is the ballistic shield and they're using it here to protect themselves from falc danger grandma who's just going ham on them but it kind of looks like that they're actually deflecting the bullets back and that gets them a kill this seems fundamentally broken to me and really weird in a battlefield game i assume that the right shield would just block projectiles rather than reflecting them back feels like that could be really annoying to fight against seems a bit unnecessary and i feel like just being able to defend yourself is enough of a unique gadget to have next up is sundance and we've seen sundance in the reveal trailer but now we get a proper look at their ability really cool clip this is and it will allow you to move very quickly from point a to point b or traverse long distances across the map just looks really fun and it's cool to think of the awesome things you could do with this several new guns in this trailer as well if you've been paying attention and their unique gadget is the smart explosive this will allow you to select between one of three grenades anti-armor emp and scatter grenades in the first clip they use the scatter grenades to kill some infantry then they switch the anti-armor throw it near a vehicle and it will lock onto it and fly towards it and explode i suppose it's a grenade version of the mbt lord that we had in battlefield 4. so it looks like sundance is a very versatile character next up is jisoo pike from south korea and they have the threat perception as their trait and this means that if an enemy does damage to you they will automatically be spotted so it's kind of like that recon perk in battlefield 5 but the other way around and their active ability is called the emg x scanner you can see they pop it there and it reveals people through walls close to you in the vicinity i have to say that i completely disagree with this being in a battlefield game and all we've got is the context of this clip you could say well it's just really close range and it's a short snapshot maybe it has a really long recharge time on it but i just feel like this kind of thing doesn't fit in battlefield perhaps a bit too futuristic for me that one i think instead maybe you could hit the pulse and it reveals people on the minimap for you and your team more of a support role rather than a personal mini wall hack for you for a few seconds let me know your thoughts on that below and finally we have angel from romania they are a support class specialist and we get a nice look at the ac 42 rifle here looks like a really heavy hitting dmr their passive ability lets you revive teammates quicker and also they come back with full health and armor obviously a great team play specialist and i'm sure this will be really valuable in 128 player matches of breakthrough and then their active gadget is the ability to call in a loadout crate and you can get armor from this ammo and you can also change your loadout so you can save loadouts and we'll get into this a bit further they switch to the sniper loadout they've got take out the guy on top of the pylon over there could be useful in some occasions on conquest where you need anti-air or anti-vehicle for example perhaps quite limited circumstances though in conquest and breakthrough because you can just redeploy change gear spawn on your squad but i see this ability being incredibly sought after in hazard zone where everyone has to play a unique specialist and if you die you're out of the game unless your team can bring you back with a gadget so in hazard zone angel could be quite a popular pick so that's it for the 10 specialists we now know what they all do when the game launches out of all 10 i think they all offer interesting balanced options apart from page and dozer they're definitely going to need some changes in my opinion but continuing on with the info drop they released some b-roll and images of updates to the game for example here we can see some of the new user interface there was a lot of stuff missing from the ui in the open beta like transport assists spawn support resupply heels they're all in there now on the left side of the screen the kill log much more readable and they've got highlighted colors denoting friend or foe killed and that massive banner across the top of the screen has gone it's not a solid color anymore it's transparent much less intrusive it looks way better they call that the critical alert message and that appears at key moments of the game if you've got majority of flags if you're losing whatever it might be so they've lowered the size of that changed how it looks and also load the frequency of those alerts check out this too you may have noticed this at the bottom of the screen in these clips the compass is permanently on the screen now in the specialist video it was how we've seen it before where when you aim down the site it appears so i think these are from different builds of the game or it's either permanently on the screen now at the bottom or perhaps you can choose whether you want it to be permanently on or just when you aim down the site either way i like having the compass there and i think it's cool that there is at least an option now it seems to have it permanently turned on this is a quick look at the loadout menu none of this was in the open beta but loadouts in the game will be fully customizable there'll be some default ones available but of course as you go along and you unlock stuff you'll be able to build your own loadout and save it pick different attachments for your guns different gadgets whatever grenade that you want and have it on tap ready to go in the game this is a look at the comma rose again not in the open beta they've changed it to a square i'm gonna call it the comma square now i don't think that'll catch on but you get the idea you can issue commands you can give orders nice and straightforward got some nice twisty tiny animation graphics here the big map as it's referred to internally here was disabled in the open beta but this is what it'll look like in the final game you can open this at any time that you're alive during gameplay by pressing the view touchpad button on console or m on pc if you're a battlefield player you'll know what this is and how useful it is installation flow this is what it will look like when you load into a game so it shows you the makeup of your squad here what their names are their levels their little player card too little cutscene here too where you can see the squad and the squad leader will make some kind of equip and then there's a bit of an audio intro to the level and what you're doing there context and narrative for the map depending on which team you're on intelligence has revealed that amid satellite relaunches the us is placing a prototype weapon into orbit the launch site is here in french guyana your mission is to bridge the facility and do whatever it takes to prevent the americans from occupying it i won't lie you can expect resistance as the americans dig in but this wouldn't be a first for you would it and then you put your gear and on first deployment there's actually a cinematic an intro i suppose overview for the level transport helicopter mad lad comes in out of nowhere drops off you and your squad into the game seamless transition there user interface turns on and then you are in for the start of the match and then end of round flow here victory russians absolutely smashed the us there gives you a brief overview and then it will highlight the players who had outstanding performances and then take a look at the number one squad kind of like it does in bf5 but i think there's a bit more information here than there is in that game level progress all the ribbons that you want any bonuses what level you're at xp all that good stuff some additional controller options here too and dice did say in the blog post that they've increased the amount of aim assist in the game for controller players some people gave some feedback that it wasn't quite enough in the game so they tweaked that crossplay invites here that's what that menu looks like and then this heat map which just shows you the most popular areas i guess of orbital which was played in the open beta now alongside all this there was a massive wall of text which had a load of information in and detail about some of these changes and additions to the game a lot of the stuff i covered in my previous video so i'm not going to repeat it aside from that the other major thing i guess was the fact that they've made changes to health regeneration by slowing down the time that it takes for the healing effect to start so it'll take you a bit longer to start regenerating health and get back to full health and the purpose of that is to increase the need to work with the medics on your team and in your squad and to help support those changes maria saret pistol has been given enhancements and tweaks to improve the feedback that you receive when successfully healing an ally and making it easier to land a syringe on a friendly target by having the syringes magnetized to friendly targets they've also made revives faster across the board in one of the clips from earlier too you can see maria falk's self-heal is now more than double the speed that it was before it's a lot quicker and in terms of differentiating between who's an enemy and who's a friend dice say that they've made some changes here too so that means that the lighting is in the process of being further enhanced to enable enemies to more readily stand out on the battlefield we're also adjusting the tint that applies to enemy soldiers and made changes to the ui so that when you're inside of 10 meters an icon is now present above the heads of enemy soldiers provided they wouldn't be otherwise occluded by any terrain or map objects similarly we're working to ensure that friendly icons will no longer be occluded through walls within 40 meters to address instances of our systems failing to represent a player as a friendly teammate before they've entered your field of view so hopefully with those changes identifying enemies and friendlies will be a lot easier and that's about all the big hitters from the update today looks like there are some great additions here i have to say though out of all of the 10 specialists so far pike and dozer some aspects of those i'm just not a fan of at all i think it would be good if dice actually elaborated on those specialists a bit more because on face value those abilities just seem really strong and in my opinion those kind of things don't really fit in a battlefield game so that's all let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
