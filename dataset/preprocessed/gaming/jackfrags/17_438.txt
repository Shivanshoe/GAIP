scope on it and you don't have any scope tint it's kind of crazy this is the build i'm using for it for a copy and twenty get here with the ram seven which is an absolute beamer right now and if you wanna see what i was using on that there we go so today two matches for you playing with study and tomographic the first one i think is the best warzone game that i personally played in terms of my own individual performance i was really try harding in a super competitive lobby and we're getting a really interesting situation at the end and then the second game is a bit more relaxed but having
