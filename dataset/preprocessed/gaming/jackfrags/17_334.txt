it's always incredibly satisfying hitting sniper shots on pilots in warzone missed the first mr second nailed the third feels good man especially when it's a rose skin that one feels particularly good so today i've got some gameplay to show you with the ffar and i've taken out the original commentary and i thought that i would just talk over the top of it make it a bit more engaging for you guys and also there's a couple other things i want to show you and talk about so the ffar it's been nerfed now but it's still incredibly powerful in the right situations and it just makes you feel invincible at times we all know how much it played the game when it was clearly the best gun in the game and then they nerfed it was it two times or three times eventually it got to a balanced state but as much fun as it was to use when it was overpowered it did start to get really annoying playing in lobbies where there's just no variety and everyone was using the ffar and you'd be melted a short medium sometimes even long ranges instantly by this thing but i think it's in a pretty balanced way now but i thought i'd revisit it and see you know can you still win games with this thing can you still beat people in 1v1s and the answer is yes you can now this blueprint that i'm using i didn't buy this pack because of the ffar skin i bought it because you get a snow leopard oh man yeah that's a snow leopard and it has a takedown too check this out absolutely ravenous that is i don't think snow leopards are that big in real life i feel like this is more like the cat from he-man like they've just scaled it up a bit what's that cat called again is it is it just battle cat or something like that i don't know but the pack's got a snow leopard in it and as it turns out it's got this really nice looking ffar skin in it as well the gameplay that i'm showing you here was a match earlier in duos with tactical brit and i didn't change the build just because i like to keep the skin consistent it's not great for warzone because it has the shorter barrel on it but up close it still just shreds people the next gameplay you're about to see though that's with a full meta build just with a different skin and i was just melting people it was great there's lots of great choices though in the meta at the moment which is good i think the ram seven is definitely quickly becoming the number one assault rifle now the a max even though it's been nerfed again is still really good mac 10 dominates the cold war mp5 is kind of creeping its way back into the bullfrog as well the hipfire on that thing is incredible and shotguns like the street sweeper very strong very good choice right now if you got it leveled up and there's just a nice sniper meta in the game at the moment too which is great for me because i love sniping obviously playing on mouse and keyboard it feels really natural for me zrg the swiss oh they're top choices right now and if you don't like those well you can always fall back to the car 98 or the spr i haven't really seen anyone using the hdr for ages though and i think that's just because guns like the swiss the carnita is so fast to fire and aim down the site and if you want the fastest velocity sniper rifle well that's not the hdr anymore it's the zrg so you take that instead and it is almost hit scan the bullet on that is so quick but first off i want to show you this clip that started to end me earlier this is one of the most bizarre warzone clips that i have ever seen and i think it could either be a bug or an incredibly rare easter egg that someone put in the game for throwing knives because i've never seen this before and this clip was uploaded to reddit by a user called veteran grump they go to throw their knife and a player model that's all kind of mangled and weird replaces the throwing knife and gets you eaten into the air i just i don't know how to explain that it's it's got to be an easter egg right like why would that be a bug why would the guys model for the throwing knife be a player it doesn't it doesn't make any sense has anyone else ever experienced that i don't know let me know but here's the start of that second ffar game we dropped tv station it's a bit of a quiet drop nowadays remember when warzone came out a lot of people would go there because she'd always get that guaranteed helicopter spawned well it felt like it was there like most of the time picked up a couple easy kills there with the groundling weapons and straight on to the ffar loadout here so it's a typical meta build let's find someone in a corner like that cheeky little jump they're gonna get shredded and we were hooning around on a truck here i just in there i think he was being shot by all of us so not really much of a chance but what can you do if you're on your own right trying to regain for your team get on the train get a recon that's the kind of maximum distance i would say that the ffr excels though perfect for that kind of range finishing off this squad we were just hunting people you know had a couple of uavs up started driving me around on the truck got this cdl skin when you 80s with the ffar you just move so fast you know with the right attachments i think i had specialists too so high alert man really saving my butt there i think that's why so many kill records are being broken at the moment there's so many world records going on because you can guarantee specialist if you drop the nakatomi tower and do one of the assignments there one of the contracts get the key card i think it's key card one and then you get up to four specialist tokens so everyone in your squad could have it when you have it it's every single perk in the game and if you drop there every single time well okay you're just going to be a terminator this was a cool clip though getting towards the end game now there's still 31 left but i just had the recoil control down really nice there [Applause] just pulling down a little bit on the mouse as i shoot bursting as much as i could and the mobility that you get with this gun is amazing i do wonder though are they going to keep nakatomi tower in the game what do you think it could just be a limited time thing maybe they've only got the license to do it for i know like till the end of the season or something but i really like it i think it's a great addition to the map not many of the pois that they've added have actually incentivized players to go there either but this one does because you can get specialists you can get a load of money from doing the vault you can get a load of money from doing the little ai bot mission under the car park so people actually go there and it's not just like one or two layers of the building there's so many different levels of that tower it's quite intricate in its design and it makes for a nice little tdm area to be honest the fight's over and the fact that you can get the vents and getting the elevator shafts awesome i love it i don't want to take it out but i have a feeling that they will this is the last squad here i was trying to just get a pick with the swiss got a couple armor breaks instead get some finishes for our teammates there make sure that there's no reviving going down and just one player left now and i think the boys are spotting me obviously as they're all running over there like a pack of hungry wolves all snow leopards snow leopards work in packs i don't think so right probably not and this little baby up here was in the tower and you're not going to win that one are you no sorry and that one will wrap up the game there i think it was 50 kills in total for the squad pretty decent game that and the ffa are performing admirably i would say what well as a sniper support there perhaps is better choices now like the a max ram 7 but still really good good fun to use and you feel like an absolute wizard when you ads and shoot with it you move so quick but with that said that's all for today folks thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like and as always thank you to all these guys using my code jack frozen caps in the cod store
