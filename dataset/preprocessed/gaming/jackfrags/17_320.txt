okay so the new season of war zone has just dropped and there's a couple of really good changes here but at the same time there's uh there's a couple things that are quite questionable and i'll show you in this video so me and the boys got on earlier myself stodd westy tactical brick checked out the update played a few different game modes we had a good time long story short there's three new guns in the game at the moment that is there's the c58 which is a long-range assault rifle didn't really get a chance to play with it much today to be honest but the cck seems pretty decent there's a nail gun which looks awesome i mean it's a nail gun right like who doesn't want to use a nail gun you can't do anything with it on the gunsmith but i picked it up in the store and it's actually very good up close it fires really fast at range it's kind of useless right but up close it's actually a four shot kill to the chest around a 350 millisecond ttk so it's pretty damn good when you're face to face with someone but the third gun that they've added i'm just laughing thinking about it it's this thing this is called the mg82 now keep in mind that today most of the time we were just using the blueprint build you can buy a blueprint of it and it has a really awful thermal scope on it and this isn't even the meta build of the gun right it fires very fast it's time to kill is sub 600 milliseconds and i'm not lying there's no recoil if you just aim and shoot there's barely any if you mount there's nothing i mean i was playing with this on mouse and you can just track people there's nothing and the ttk is so quick they just get beamed instantly i'm not exaggerating here either this isn't like a classic youtube clickbait title oh my god the new mg82 is so overpowered it's insane exploding head no it's stupid i don't understand it's really fun to use don't get me wrong i had an absolutely great time this morning running around with this beaming people but you don't have a chance to react it's almost as bad as the dmr was and it's a bit weird to me because i think raven have been doing so well with their weapon balancing recently and then disappears in the game and i'm like why why did you do it but i reckon that the stats of it will probably be changed in a couple days i think it's that bad i don't know if there's a mistake with it or it's just silly today tomorrow yeah it's gonna be pretty fun day three day four when everyone's unlocked it fully and got the full meta build warzone's gonna be painful again you'll go into the open you'll try and run from cover to cover and you're dead it really does feel like that again and i personally don't like that i don't think that's healthy for the game having a ttk that fast but like i said it's really weird because also with this update there's a ton of balance to the existing weapons in the game already some really great changes like the cold war barrels for example some of the cold war snipers again they've been buffed a little bit in terms of the assault rifles now most of the cold war ones are going to be very competitive after today's update i think the cold war ak is looking real good right now they know if they a max a little bit again but it's still good the scar h got a buff which is really cool i love that gun i've done a couple of videos on it before but it's been buff now the ttk on that gun came down by around 200 milliseconds so it's a big buff for it but because you get a low magazine count it might only be good in solos but i'm definitely going to check that out maybe do a video on that the stone is going to be real strong the pharah is going to be even better so some guns have been buffed some have been nerfed across the board and they also said at the bottom of the patch notes that there's a huge overhaul coming to the weapons and they say that it will add more time to the time to kill so overall you'll get a longer ttk whenever this new update goes live and i think that's great but for the meantime with this mg82 it is what it is it's in the game but i'm telling you it's going to be pretty nasty next few days or so there's also this as well this is an armored truck okay definitely some raised eyebrows with this one too from me now the normal trucks are still in the game your typical bertha but another addition are these satellites so these radar dishes on the ground you interact with them and a satellite bit of debris falls from the sky onto the level and you go up to it you interact with it and it spits out either a advanced uav thing i don't remember the name of it it's like a par for an off or something maybe i've got that wrong i don't remember it's an advanced uav that last stages or the second call in is an armored truck and it's kind of cool it's delivered in this hc-130 thing but the thing with the armored truck is it's an armored truck but it can be upgraded on the back of it is a buy station and these are the options you can buy a trophy system for it so c4 rockets it'll be protected from all that you can refill the trophy system you can repair the truck you can add heavy armor you can add a permanent uav yes a permanent uav until you leave the vehicle all the vehicles destroyed and you can update the gun on the top i didn't tell you did i yeah there's a gun on the top with infinite ammo it can overheat but you can get an upgrade here make sure that cooldown's less and when you're in that and you've upgraded the armor it's really hard to shoot you out of it and you can also get like on the box ammunitions box from it too this is crazy we had a great time though getting it driving around in it just muller in any squad that we found to be honest because they couldn't really touch it until we figured out myself and westy we have the new mg with the cavalry lancer barrel on it and that does more damage to vehicles and in this situation here we just both opened up on it and destroyed it really quick so it just depends on what your loadout is but i think for the average player who might not necessarily run the cavalry barrel who aren't communicating with each other the truck's a massive problem and they've just addressed this in solos right where they nerfed the amount of trucks so you don't get that thing at the end of the game where there's just loads of them roaming around like sharks and yeah i know this is a call and it's kind of rng you have to go to the satellite you have to hope that you get the truck instead of the uav but once this is in the war zone if you don't focus on it you're in trouble and it does shake up the metro a little bit i'll give it that but i just see it getting really annoying we'll see how it goes though i only played for about three hours this morning but every time that we had this thing or we saw this thing it was game over so maybe a bit too strong some of the things too they added a couple of gestures like here's westy giving me the guardians of the galaxy middle finger there's one with a cigar they also changed the rose skin again they've made it a bit more gray i think it's definitely easier to see when you're outside but inside still a little bit of an issue the specialist token you can now find that in orange boxes so it's super rare but if you get this you're going to be op and they said that specialist does have a place in warzone it's just uh maybe in the future if you pick it up you'll get the player perks but you might not get the gun perks if you know what i mean so some changes coming to that also bikes dirt bikes these are really fun absolutely loved pooning around the level on these things you can do tricks and jumps off ramps and all sorts but they are incredibly noisy like annoyingly noisy it's like a wasp it's in your ear and it doesn't want to leave that's what the bikes like well they're fun one awesome update though with this patch for the new season is they've nerfed the melee with the pistol so now instead of just being able to like two shots someone where you going bang bang and they're down it's now three shots it's bang bang bang so that's great because i mean there are multiple occasions that i can think of where i've been in a building i've got a shotgun i've got an smg and i'm beaten by someone who's just hiding in a bathtub and they run up to me and go bang bang you're dead didn't seem fair but that's changed now all in all though lots of changes with this update generally speaking i love the updates to the cold war weapons the assault rifles in particular that new mg though that's madness i don't i just don't get it but as i said raven have been quite responsive with stuff recently so maybe they'll look at that pretty soon and that's about it guys i want to thank you for
