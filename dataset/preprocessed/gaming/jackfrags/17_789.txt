introducing the m3 grease gun this iconic SMG has just been added to battlefield 5 today and before we get into the nitty-gritty of it I wanted to show you a few tricks that it's got [ __ ] sleeve technically this is the first gun in the multiplayer game that has a removable suppressor on it the commando carbine was the first suppressed weapon but that suppressor is permanently on there and cannot be removed the grease gun however offers you the choice at level 4 on the specialization tree you can choose to add a suppressor or opt for less vertical recoil on the surface the suppressor doesn't seem to offer much of a benefit seeing us farming your gun doesn't affect the mini-map in this game at all so you might think well all this is going to do is give me a lower audio profile and maybe I'll look a bit cooler when I could have less vertical recoil so what's the point firstly I didn't know this at all as it was just never explained in the game but did you know that in bf5 if you hit someone with a suppressor they won't see a damage Direction indicator let me demonstrate so my friend haves here is shooting me with the grease gun and at the moment it doesn't have a suppressor on it and you can clearly see the damage indicator correctly displayed on my screen and making me aware of his location but if we were to try that again with these suppressor on let's see what happens no damage indicator interesting so that would give you quite a tactical advantage if the enemy hasn't seen you and that kind of thing will be really good for ambush kills when you're hiding in some foliage maybe or a dark building in terms of the audio difference well let's take a look or a listen to that - here are some comparisons at various distances away 10 20 30 and 40 meters [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so there is a bit of a difference there and is quieter but still audible I think what dice have done here is up for a more realistic sounding suppressor rather than your typical Hollywood goldeneye pewpewpew and with it being a bit quieter you may or may not pick that one out of the crowd in a battle when there's a ton of ambient noise going on around you and remember the sound of it will also change depending on what kind of environment you're in how is it in practice then in a real game is this actually a competitive weapon well after the release of the type 2 a submachine gun you would be forgiven for thinking that you'd never need to use another SMG again it's fair to say that the type 2 8 is a very good weapon and it's just dominating the game in the kill feed right now but with the grease gun being kind of iconic will it be able to tempt you based on its stats and a lot of you may be asking well why is it called the grease gun where did it get that name from it's actually quite simple it's because of the resemblance to an actual grease gun at all that's used by a mechanic and this gun was chambered in 45 ACP rounds and that's the same rounds that are fired by the Thompson but the grease gun was lighter and cheaper to produce but apparently less accurate I think if I asked most people which weapon they thought was more accurate in real life out of the Thompson and the grease gun I imagine most people would say the grease gun the weapon was designed as a replacement for the Thompson but it only started to enter the front line in mid-1944 of world war ii and due to delays in its production it actually saw a fairly limited combat in the war later variants were used quite often though in the Korean War and future conflicts but going back to that suppressor having used it in-game a bit and come up against people who were using it to I will say that in reality it isn't really that useful because it's a close-range weapon and you're really unlikely to be shooting enemies that are beyond 42 the meters anyway when maybe it would make a difference so the chances are that you'll both be able to see each other as enemies anyway having said that our Maps like Aris or especially the new Pacific Maps a suppressed weapon can really come into its own especially when enemies are not getting any indication of where they shot from as demonstrated at the start of the video because there's a lots of foliage trees and bushes that you can hide in on those maps make your lying prone there's even a better chance that enemies are not going to work out where you are and where they're being shot from and I think it would be great if dice would start talking about some of these little extra benefits the weapons that players might not know exist I think it would be quite useful even when the VAR came out a few weeks ago not anywhere on that weapon did it say this weapon does slightly more damage when you use the slower rate of fire sure players in the know who watch a lot of YouTube videos will spend a lot of time on reddit or looking at stats would know that or maybe they've picked up the information from somewhere else but casual players the average player wouldn't have ever actually known that and it seems weird that it's not outlined somewhere on the weapons page but having played with it for a few hours today I found the grease gun really fun to use the sound and animations of this gun make you feel as though it really packs a punch and a medium range I found it quite satisfying to use the gun does bounce around a bit more at range especially when you start hitting that 30 to 50 meters location but that's to be expected with an SMG up close and personal you may struggle a bit more because the gun only has a 450 rate of fire even though it's a three bullets to kill within 10 meters it's quite punchy but we all know with the release of the type 2 a rate of fire is a massive benefit when you're playing in close quarters which is where a lot of the fights happen in battlefield 5 in fact during my time playing with the grease gun I'd say that the type 2 8 was the weapon I was probably killed by the most but despite that I can still see myself playing with the grease can regularly mainly because it just sounds and feels great to use and after spending a lot of time using the type 2a it's quite nice going back to a gun that's perhaps a little bit more challenging to use where you've got to maybe operated a different engagement distance and headshots will really help you out with this one too hipfire well it isn't all that great either but there are some specs that can help you out with that the good news though is that if you want to unlock this gun it's quite easy to get this week's times of bull challenge mainly focuses around medic play and simply capturing objectives you've got to get three objectives and then get some kills heal some teammates get a melee kill capture some more objectives and you're good to go a few quick tips those squad conquest is great for getting the capture points done really quick as most of the play is essentially both teams going around in a big circle between the objectives also the bayonet does count as a melee weapon so if you find it it's the easiest way to get a melee kill if you're struggling so when it comes to those specializations we've already covered the most important ones and I went for the improved ABS speed but then your route is really dependent on how you want to use this gun either choose the right side for better aimed accuracy or left for better hipfire it just all depends on your playstyle the last specialization is either the suppressor or the recoil buffer as I mentioned and I wonder if this is something we will see more in the game now will more weapons that are added down the line have an option for a suppressor perhaps the two at the end could turn into three there were actually a lot of guns in World War two that had suppressed variants even though a lot of them were prototypes I personally would love to see more of them just to offer up a bit more variety and wrapping things up today the launch of the grease gun also signals the end of this chapter of tides of war this was the last week of course there will be another chapter we assume we hope but no word just yet on when that will arrive or what the content will be included in it but hopefully we'll get more information on that soon perhaps even some details of the jungle map that's been teased recently I look forward to checking that out but as for what comes after that well no one knows yet and I'm surprised that we still don't know what's coming next for the game the Pacific was undoubtedly a massive hit when it released but I think fans are definitely longing for more of those iconic World War 2 experiences I for one would love to see some kind of announcement soon about the Eastern Front introducing the Russian army and all of the additional weapons and vehicles and equipment that come with that the type 2a yeah it's a fun SMG to play with but it's no PBS a can it hasn't scratch that itch for me just yet I'd also love to see more of American army of course they weren't in the game until the Pacific was released but I think it's about time in battlefield 5 that we get Sherman's versus tiger tanks in France and I know they're really cliche and yes they've been done hundreds of times before but that doesn't stop me wanting to experience the kind of battles like Carentan or Omaha Beach or the San Mara gliese in a modern frostbite game if I were to make a guess I think maybe introducing the Russians and having maps which feature the Russians and Americans pushing Germany back towards Berlin ultimately ending the war in Europe maybe that's a realistic expectation on how dice can actually wrap development on battlefield 5 up and that's all for today folks thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't have dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]
