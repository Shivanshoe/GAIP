in today's video i'm going to show you the meta weapons and builds that you should be using in warzone to gain an advantage and dominate the competition we're just going to get straight into it no messing around and if you enjoyed this video or find it useful hit that like button below okay first the bruin the bruin is the absolute best weapon in the game right now even after the nerf it beats most assault rifles has good mobility and practically no recoil you've probably noticed almost everyone runs it on their first loadout at the moment here's how you should build it mono suppressor xrk summit 26.8 inch barrel attack laser the lk optic and 60 round mags quick note the vlk optic has a secret buff and it reduces vertical and horizontal recoil by about 10 percent it's really good and it's got quite a clear sight too this brew and build shreds use it if you still haven't unlocked it yet the easiest way to do it is join an mp game equip a thermal scope on lmg throw a smoke at your feet and shoot people through the smoke do that three times per match and check the status of the unlock when you've got it for that round quit that game and join another lobby i unlocked it in around 40 minutes using this method i do expect the bruin to be nerfed again i think it's just too good right now next mp5 in my opinion and experience the mp5 is the only smg worth using at the moment the mp7 gives you a little bit more range and mag size but at that distance i'm using an assault rifle anyway so i would always take the mp5 for room clearing and close range frantic firefights where i need mobility rate of fire and quick reload speed here's the build to go with monolithic integral suppressor barrel merc full grip 45 round mag stippled grip tape and slice of hand for super quick reloads the mp5 is your friend use it assault rifles the kilo 141 new meta weapon that's come up in season five perfect for firefights in trios and quads where you're engaging at around 50 to 80 meters the build i'm about to show you has little to no recoil it's an absolute laser beam and that's the mono suppressor the sim guard 19.8 inch barrel vlk optic commando 4 grip 60 round mags 100 the perfect setup for this gun try this one out and sit at those close to medium ranges and you will dominate the m4 still one of the top performing all-around weapons in the game and i think that we will start to see more and more of this again exceptional rate of fire accuracy and easy to control recoil there are two builds for this one based on your preferences really my favorite build is this one because i don't mind the iron sights and i like the extended range that you get with this and that's the mono suppressor the m16 grenadier barrel attack laser commando 4 grip and 60 round mags if you don't like the iron sight then i'd go with this build instead and you do get slightly better mobility ads speed and hip fire but you'll lose a bit of range and that's the mono suppressor corvus custom barrel vlk 3.0 optic commando 4 grip and 60 round max m4 still a really good choice next the ram 7 one of my new favorite guns in the game i think this is the best assault rifle to use in solo matches if you've got a smart play style because the ttk is insane on this thing and it should not be overlooked the recall it can be a bit tricky to manage at times because it pulls a lot horizontally but once you get the hang of it and you learn its effective distance you will smash most of the assault rifles and this is the build to use mono suppressor fss ranger barrel gi mini reflex optic again it's your choice but i like the gi mini reflex on this gun commando 4 grip and 50 round mags give it a shot works great moving on the ground same as the bruin even after the damage range nerf it still shreds and it will offer you plenty of versatility it's just a really reliable gun and the iron sight on the chosen barrel here is really clean and easy to use so you can add another attachment instead for even better recoil control and ads speed the build for this hasn't really changed in a while but here is my favorite setup mono suppressor tempus 26.4 archangel barrel tack laser commando 4 grip 60 round mags if you don't like the iron sights and would prefer slightly better recoil control then you can take off the tack laser and put the vlk scope on instead sniper rifles hdr still the top dog incredibly fast bullet speed and accuracy don't bother with the x50 hdr is just better for range and drop off if you're up on a building scanning for targets hdr is the king this is my build mono suppressor 26.9 inch hdr pro barrel tack laser variable zoom scope and ftac stalker scout stock if you're fine with the default scope and you don't want that extra zoom level you can add a perk like focus or fully loaded which are always useful also i do like to use the crossthread reticle on the hdr i just prefer it over the default one but you do have to unlock it my only other consideration for a sniper which is technically a marksman rifle in this game is the car 98 if i want to be a bit more aggressive and mobile when picking people off at a distance i would still in most scenarios take the hdr over this but the car 98 can be fun and competitive if you want it to be this is the car 98 build i go with mono suppressor sim guard custom 27.6 inch barrel attack laser variable zoom scope and stippled grip tape and the final meta weapon right now is the origin 12 kind of came out of nowhere but it's a great replacement for the mp5 if you're in a building or at close range the origin 12 gives you superior ttk mobility and hip fire than most of the weapons in the game you can chunk through squads with this gun this is my build choke on the muzzle forged attacking paler barrel five mw laser no stock and 12 round mags absolute dirt love it and that's it some people would put the file in this list as an mp5 replacement but i just hate clicking so that can do one m13 as well maybe but the current stats of it don't quite do the job for me i hope you enjoyed this and found it informative please do share it around and leave a like and a comment below to support
