today we're taking a look at what is known as the world's fastest gaming monitor the asus pg259 qn 360 hertz that's right 360 as smooth as you like we're also pairing this with an nvidia rtx 3090 graphics card for maximum frames with that said before we get into the meat and bones of this one it has to be noted that at 1080p you won't be getting that kind of frame rate in many modern games and this is aimed squarely at competitive players who want the absolute best gear for games like counter strike and valorum however after i've been using this for a few days it is an overall exceptional gaming monitor it is the most responsive blur free monitor that i've ever played on and a treat to experience other games on two such as warzone and battlefield on a high level the main talking point to that 360hz refresh rate 1080p resolution ips panel for good colors and viewing angles minimal input lag hdr g-sync and one ms greater gray it also comes with something that i've never seen before and it's a really cool feature by nvidia called the reflex latency analyzer and this is used for measuring system latency and input lag which we'll look at now and if you're a massive nerd like i am it's easy to get excited about this kind of stuff i've talked about nvidia reflex in a video previously and if you turn it on in supported games they will feel more responsive especially in gpu bound scenarios it's incredibly complicated and i won't bore you with the fine details but for the user it's as easy as turning it on in the settings but the latency analyzer is something that's built into the monitor and to use it we have to plug our mouse into the monitor itself once you've done that load up a game and open the nvidia performance overlay and this will show you stuff like your fps your render latency mouse latency system latency etc all useful to know the next step is to enable the latency analyzer menu from the monitor controls and once that's turned on you'll notice a big box appear on your screen you then have to reposition this onto the end of your gun in whatever game that you're playing in this case modern warfare with nvidia reflex turned on and now when you click your mouse to fire the gun the analyzer looks for a sudden change in pixels within that square like the muzzle flash of your gun and it then measures how long it took from you clicking the mouse to that change in pixels being displayed on your screen therefore giving you a latency result obviously the lower the better now this may not be impressive to some people but for me having such a simple tool to do this is a game changer if i'd wanted to do this in the past i would need to buy a high frame rate camera record the screen and the mouse i would then have to look at the footage frame by frame in an editing software and count everything manually eventually using maths to give me my final latency result and i got a c in maths at school so you can see why i'm excited about this so if you're somebody who strives to get the best gaming equipment and reach your maximum potential this is awesome because you can test this and see the results for yourself then and there so this means that if i couldn't decide between three different mice that i liked i now have a simple way to test which one of them has the lowest input latency for my system it also allows me to see how different graphic settings affect my frame rate and system latency to strike a nice balance between visuals and responsiveness for example in battlefield 5 with everything maxed out on ultra graphics after five clicks on the mouse my average latency was 35.4 ms whereas when i tested again with everything on the lowest settings the average was 20.3 ms and yeah that's just a difference of 15.1 milliseconds but in competitive fps games like cs where every millisecond counts that could be the difference between you hitting or missing a vital flick shot with a sniper rifle some other interesting tests that i plan on doing in the following week are kind of specific to streaming games but i intend to see how much latency cloning your screen adds and also running a pass-through on a capture card on a streaming pc because that kind of stuff is important to content creators i thought that it would be fun too to compare counter-strike and valorent as valorent has got nvidia reflex in it both of these games have incredibly low latency though compared to others as you can see by the numbers here 6.4 was the lowest latency i recorded on valorent making it the most responsive and consistent game that i tested proving how well this game is optimized for competitive gaming cs go 1 000 frames per second here on dust2 crazy again consistently low results which is great to see but valorent takes the crown here wrapping things up i'm just happy the hardware manufacturers are actually caring about this kind of stuff now and giving us easy ways to monitor and measure it reflex is a great feature to have as is the latency analyzer yeah not everyone will be into this or even use it or care about it perhaps but for some pc gamers this can help improve their setups considerably as for the monitor like i said at the start it feels to me like the most responsive monitor that i've ever played on in terms of being connected to it when you're moving the mouse with your hand and seeing that reflected on the screen can you notice the difference between 240 hertz and 360 hertz though i would say a little bit when you're swiping quickly across the screen but most people would be hard-pressed to tell which one was which if you put them side by side in an a b test i'd personally love if this monitor was 1440p too as i'm so used to that resolution now for gaming and editing browsing and it just makes a massive difference in big br games like warzone and apex in terms of noticing players and aiming at targets further away but outside of a 240hz 1080p monitor with dayak i think this is the best that you could get right now if you're a competitive counter-strike or valorant player yeah it's very expensive but if you want the best 1080p high frequency monitor you're going to pay a lot for it and that's all guys thank you for watching a big thanks to nvidia for providing the rtx 3090 graphics card and monitor for this video it goes without saying that the 3090 is an absolute beast for 1440p and 4k it's just awesome to get to test this stuff and i feel very lucky to be able to do this kind of thing and i hope you guys found this entertaining and got some value out of it if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
