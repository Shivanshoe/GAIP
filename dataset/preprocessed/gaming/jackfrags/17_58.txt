the underground or something see if you can get this to work somebody can't it requires a soft touch i can't wait for you to experience forward is back yeah i've done that several times already and now drive what audrey he's a soft touch mate you just you know you got to do it right that's some [ __ ] so to the northeast to some mountains and then there's a grassy patch at the top let's go up there but the guy said that these guys came over the mountain so there could be something up here okay how are we gonna know i don't know i guess we just there's something there tom to see that what is it what the hell is this i've got a helmet there it is that's the helmet who's that in there then put his helmet back on now we need that there is look i killed the predators can i have the hunting rifle add it to your character rifle tom yes well you should have a rifle in your inventory now yeah it's a mayor's leg mayor's leg i almost just shot you in the face there just to see what would happen remember that the server would just end so maybe not a good idea wow i can't believe you've done this it's a one bang you're right thomas we must find the next treasure okay let's go we don't know where it quite where it is now somewhere around here we may find it the goblet of fire where is it well it's just a goblet just on the ground well it could be the goblet or the dagger we don't

we're gonna need both of them if we're getting if we're making sausage we need both of them don't we okay that pig has got really big now i think we should mince her because i just feel like we need more money look at the size of it wait where's the where's the wooden things right okay three pieces that pig will make more pigs yeah but we've got already got other pigs to make more pigs no but then we have to wait for that one to get fast and big like you don't even know whether you might have only just reached maturity that pig is definitely mature look at the size of it she's going to like pop out some piglets where's the lads like of age but we've got to wait for the lads to become of age but if we if we kill her then we've got to wait for this new sal to get as big as her and she's our first pig we ever bought she's never just got to this big no but look i want to see what the sausage stuffing is like you know i'm looking for more gameplay loops yes but you don't even remember her just think about the money adam think about the money killer yeah well look first of all we need to do something about the money that you think about right you think about it just relax what's the plan it's relaxing don't put that good at home i'll kill the server everyone put the guns down put the guns put the gun the gameplay loop that's what we need to do but we need wood first all right make sure you're spending all that money on the meat grinder if we don't turn it into meat we need to make meat out of them but patience guys all right no it's not yes fine but like there's plenty of time for patients i want to see a pig become sausage there's plenty of time for faces it's the most impatient thing to ever say well i want to build a table for the sausage stuffer bring it back oh you've been launched do you want to see i don't i don't want to be there and everything i'm not i don't want to look i'm going to go look i'm just going to go to the garage you don't want to say goodbye come with me come with me make sure the others don't get out what's this one's name don't it's better that we don't name him oh it's so fat i can't literally out jack i can't let it see it

its tail oh that's so much meat think about the sausages tom ah it doesn't seem to be where is it going do we need to book it yeah i mean i'll be honest i think that's just going on the floor it'll just waste that's the smashing we need to make it we need a bucket we need a bucket there you go look look at that you got the pan paint products it's in your hand tom well i want to grind it there you go grind out nice oh yeah look at that oh and then you can just put the meat pulp fuels on the side there ready these are the fruits of our labor that's grinding up this i mean i hope it doesn't go bad or anything before we put it in there uh well it's fine who knows it's quite therapeutic yes yeah winding sausages yeah horrible you're gonna become a butcher jam yeah right all right need be put in the garage yeah the garage will be good are you trying to kill me with that adam what do you mean should i use a stand gun i'm not on jack oh my god that's the full no country for old men then

made some dried patties there you go loading area here we go we're a businessman times two multiplier on beef chicken and pork lovely okay pork salami 240 apart pork sausage yeah but we almost made back on half of the meat we made from her she's 300 that's 280 so the sausage is more profitable yeah i've not been here yet why are all these burgers just out there's no one here to eat them no no they're just waiting for the customers now go cold yeah get it he cannot you can turn it into this oh god daddy run in front of him this has happened in many games many many games what are you talking

right get inside oh my god i reckon this is a big a big big big reward enough to buy a new car it's 400 i think but that should be enough to get a little like pickup truck that is significantly better than this thing just any type of car would be good we let's hope that the new car doesn't have this feature built into it jesus christ get it tom come on oh wait tom come on yeah oh wow bear down oh
