so yes as you can see there are dinosaurs on the new our large encampment map in the bf5 update today a t-rex skull and three little dinosaur toys which we've seen in many battlefield games beforehand not sure if there's any more to this but it's kind of cool and it was discovered on the BFE discord also check this out on the new extended Provence map there are tractors there were three tractors that you can hop on and drive around to your heart's content find yourself one of these bad boys get yourself on the horn and have a great time think subtracted jousting may be in order so yes there was a big update for bf5 today but it's bittersweet for me because this is the last content drop for Battlefield 5 after this that's all she wrote no more additional maps or weapons or gadgets or anything as far as I know coming to the game just quality of life improvements if there's any horrible bugs but we do have the future of the next title to look forward to maybe we'll hear some more about that at EA play but I very much doubt that with that said we are going to take a look at the update today it's substantial it's exciting there's a load of stuff here like I said it's just a shame that it's going to be the last so what do we have here two new maps which we will take a look at in more detail later on in the video 9 new weapons 5 new gadgets three new grenades and six new vehicles along with a ton of bug fixes and additional improvements to the game so there's a lot to get stuck into here to start with though I wanted to take a look at the new gadgets because I think these are some of the coolest things they will definitely add an element of sandbox fun back into the game so let's see right so we're going to start looking at the m3 infrared this is for the Recon class look at this thing what the hell it's absolutely mad what even is that I did look the surf and apparently this is a real thing they had in world would say you get 16 shots in the mag got a nice sound to it that's how it looks through the scope but obviously in real life I don't think it would look anything like this because it's daytime it's kind of weird because there's no nighttime maps in via five but it could be alright in some of the darker levels that maybe the operation underground devastation that's the m3 infrared and here is the Doppler flare the Doppel source and it does what it says on the tin you get two flares one two cool reload though there most be do they dip like that can you just pop them out interesting and also for the recons we've got this the rmn 50 grand a launcher or mortar as they call it now you can just click like that and it will explode eventually or if you hold the fire button down you can almost choose the detonation range so there you see it detonated at 12 meters but if I do a longer shot let's say 52 you can actually have it burst midair so I think what that's doing when you hold it down is telling it when to explode if that makes sense I think that's how it works so that could be really deadly that's the k31 on the Recon class bolt-action rifle for what I can tell you can only have the scythe that's built into this - you can't actually change that that's how it looks man I've got so much work to do man so many videos I could do on these for the assault class only one new primary again this is the m1941 johnson johnson looks nice and it interesting design by that quite fast too it's got a side loading clip that's weird individual bullet load as well think you'd be quicker to rio like that though wouldn't you expend at least one of those five round clips and then you gadget for the assault classes this little bad boy the pistol flamethrower I feel like it's aliens so on the support class series the show show really slow rate of fire I assume that's gonna be higher damage maybe high accuracy or something feels like it handles quite differently to how it was in the f1 a nice looking weapon though I'm sure they might have a couple of decent skins for this but one of these support gadgets is this the camp pistol but that's how it looks got a nice sound to it as well it's more anti-infantry than anti-vehicle like BAC grenade pistol and the other support primary is the Sjogren's i used to love this gonna be f1 i'm guessing it's gonna be an absolute monster okay in ba5 I have to test get an operation under ground do some grinding it's nice very nice model isn't it done a great job with that this one here is the shaped-charge and I'm going to demonstrate it on this poor tractor here stick on the vehicle and then you wait and it explodes and the vehicle goes bye-bye it's quite explosive let me tell you ask for medics well they only got one new primary weapon and here it is the well gun very small compact SMG I'll say that's like a medium rate of fire really 32 rounds in the mag doe I reckon this might be pretty good in hipfire if you spec it that way but to test it out no new gadgets for the medics their new sidearms PPK you can go for James Bond if you want a really fast rate of fire I don't suppose this that high damage though and here's the suppressed version I kind of was expecting it to sound like that I thought the more it sounds like the suppressed pistol from Goldeneye the better that's got a nice pew to it definitely I like it and here's the welrod really interesting this is suppressed and I had to go with it earlier and it was pretty much one bang hedge I think everyone there was a couple times when people were further away and I'd get a headshot and it wouldn't kill them so I don't know if it's like a one hit kill headshot 200 meters or something but you fire a shot and you have to load a new bullet in and the reload - look at this yeah good fun to use this one and then finally for the sidearms we've got these suppressed m1911 look at this baby oh that's nice great sound to it - love that as for the new grenades we've got this one here which is the demolition grenade that's like anti-vehicle mind that you can throw so as far as I'm aware that won't explode unless a vehicle drives over it or someone shoots it so if I chuck it over there you can actually throw that quite far and there we go I don't know what that would do to a tank I think it do I don't know if it would disable a tank maybe and then we've got the type 99 mines you can throw these down they explode anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds so it's almost like they have a random time random so they could detonate at 5 seconds they could detonate at 10 or anywhere in between they do stick to vehicles as well so it could be useful to just throw that quickly at a Jeep that was passing by or something and then hear the firecrackers they only make one sound it's that editor that's all you get not really sure what the use is for those in a battlefield game unless maybe they show up on the mini-map as an enemy or something but yeah that's what they're in terms of the two additional maps that have been added to the game this is the proper new map I suppose the one that no one's seen or played on before our margin Kampmann it's a very linear layout as you can see ABCDE only five flags this is the conquest variant something interesting about this though in breakthrough I believe if you get to the last sector it changes into conquest assault and you have to essentially push the defenders off the map if we go in with a free cam here we can get a better look at these flags the a flag is a very small area just a couple of military vehicles and a well liked that's it ready for a not much going on there to be honest like we've seen that a bit over to be pretty much just this sheltered garden I suppose not really much going on there big infantry map this obviously sees a lot more open a couple of artillery pieces they're different flanking routes d it starts to get a bit chaotic again this kind of garden area currently being sheltered death by artillery and then finally over here like a market area I suppose lots of spices elaborate rugs fruit your fruit killing skills are remarkable long game well there we go that's our margin Cameron pretty fun I like it and this is the second new in inverted commas map Provence because you'll recognize this area here the town province was originally a map design for the 5v5 competitive mode which was cancelled but they did put it in the game as a small scale infantry map in the end but now they've made it a full 64 player conquest map so we've got a B and C a by the town I've got a bridge here DS a windmill and E is this farm area so we'll go in and take a quick look here a just this destroyed of windmill complete with moving parts look at that cogs science engineering really open to be honest that flag vehicles over here will have a whale of a time lots of these powerful flowers here I don't know what these are they lavender maybe I'm not a horticulturist so please forgive me the e flag over here there's a lot of space between a a couple of barn buildings nice parasol very 60s and then over here we've got the C flag bridge got some guys fighting over it here might be a difficult point to hold on to that and then the town you'll recognize this a and B I think they have extended it a little bit maybe they have but yeah I'm not sure if I like this map that much because you've just got the majority of the players in here and then just this this vast open space may be the vehicle players will enjoy it but to me this kind of map design it's not that fun in battlefield but yeah give it a go for yourself and see what you think I'm disappointed I can't see any tractors why is no one who knew around on a tractor right now are you an attractor you're not a tractor guys come on tractors or there's one burning maybe someone had a bad day in that tractor not entirely sure but that's Provence now these are the four new airplanes that we've got all for the u.s. faction I've got the a20 bomber which is absolutely massive I've not tried to use it yet but they have some pretty significant specializations that you can go down they've also got the P 79 fighter it's also quite a chunky boy we've got the p-51d fighter such a cool-looking airplane that and the p-51 K and then in terms of ground vehicles there are two one for the u.s. faction which is this say the m8 Greyhound beautiful and also finally for the German faction the Puma and a lot of people wanted this in the game got a couple of helmets on the side they're set dressing I'm not sure if they've actually they have included some vehicle customization for these there we go so those are the new vehicles like I said haven't had a chance to play in these yet so I couldn't really give any feedback on them but yeah pretty cool something else that's been added to if you go to your guns and customize you'll notice at the bottom now there are charms and at the moment that's all you get a stopped clock but it's kind of cool that there's a weapon charm on the side there I don't know if this was a greater plan that they had maybe if this was introduced much earlier on because weapon charms in popular FPS games warzone pub G apex people love this kind of stuff so it's kind of a shame maybe we won't get any more of these but you could think of so many cool ones that you could have that are relevant to battlefield but for now that's what we working with the stock clock so that's it that's the majority of the content that you'll be getting today stuff that you'll be using and seeing around you all the new stuff I have to say that it is quite sizable there's been some new cosmetics on earth too there are let's say a bit more authentic to World War two so I'm sure we'll see those soon however like I said at the start this is really bittersweet because it feels like battlefield 5 was just getting into its stride and this content drop is awesome there's so much here but at the same time I think I can understand why dice have taken this decision they've stopped development on battlefield 5 they've stopped it on battlefront 2 and they're just focusing on one game you would assume now which is battlefield 6 whatever the next game is and I'm ok with that I'm sad that bf5 didn't become everything that it could have been but I am happy that they just focused on bf6 because there's a lot of great stuff that they can take from BF 5 and I'm sure that they've learnt lots of lessons with it too so I am positive and good luck to them with the next title with that said I will be making beer 5 videos here again because there's new stuff to explore new weapons to test out new maps of course I'll be doing a couple more episodes of across the battlefield on the two new maps complete that series I did it for the f1 and with the last two maps that will be it for bf5 so look out for that stuff let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys I'm sure a lot of you are probably back on df5 today to check out the new stuff let me know how you feel and if you liked the video guys leave a like it's a really great way to support me thank you and a comment down below -
