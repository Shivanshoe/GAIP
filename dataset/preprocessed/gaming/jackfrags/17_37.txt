i want you to pay close attention to the video on screen at the moment examine it carefully at first glance you might think that this is some real life footage recorded on a phone by a bystander at a train station but the truth is that this is all rendered in unreal engine 5 computer graphics created by the user subject n on youtube they state in the comments below the video that this was created in about a month's time for that level of fidelity that is an incredible feat and there's a lot of original assets in here too according to the artist this demo can be run in its daytime mode in real time with 30 to 50 fps in 1440p resolution it doesn't look quite as good but this is a glimpse into what true next-gen video games will look like and now that the series x and playstation 5 are becoming more readily available i think the next few years are going to look incredible and what about this is this a new halo game no but i recorded this earlier today it's a fan made halo experience called zeta halo created by infinite forges a level artist at gearbox entertainment and it's all running in real time here on unreal engine 5 and i recorded this on my own pc the lighting quality and fidelity of the environment is breathtaking and you can try this for yourself now if you want to just pray that your pc doesn't take off so today we're going to take a deep dive into unreal engine 5 and why i'm so excited about it in terms of new games that we'll be releasing soon sometimes though you've got to look at where you've been to see where you're going it's time for a bit of history i've no doubt that many of you will be familiar with a game called unreal tournament it was one of the best arena shooters of its day and i spent way too much time playing on facing worlds against bots and sniping them in the head but it's the original game that was just titled unreal that released the year before in 1998 that i want to look back on here not for the game itself although it was popular but because of the engine that powered it also called unreal and it was the first game released to be powered by that engine if i had to think back to a moment that i personally really sat up and paid attention to video game engines and the unreal engine in particular for me it was likely with the release of gears of war on the xbox 360 way back in 2006. now gear set the bar of high quality visuals and that was all down to the most up-to-date version of the unreal engine at the time from that point on though the unreal engine would become one of the most popular ones used by not only aaa studios but also indie developers too graphically it was capable of producing stunning visuals but it was the package as a whole that was appealing a suite of tools available to developers made the game production process much more streamlined and its current licensing model means that you won't pay a single penny for usage of the engine until your game earns at least 1 million us dollars now recently the latest iteration of the engine unreal engine 5 has been released to the general public and i thought that we would take a look at why the engine is so impressive and it was almost two years ago that we got the first look of the new engine with a real-time demo running on playstation 5. it showcased a few new features for unreal lumen which was a completely dynamic lighting system and then their chaos physics engine but what blew me away was something called nanite and it's essentially a system that allows millions of polygons to be rendered in real time they showed this off in impressive fashion while also being rendered in real time on a next-gen console one of the most recent showcases though was an actual playable demo that you can download on playstation 5 xbox series sx and now in a way on pc it was called the matrix awakens and as you can imagine the demo was centered around the matrix just like every unreal showcase it looks incredible it takes place in a large open world city but there's a brief story-esque element with some quick time events and an epic car chase the point of the demo though other than to promote the new matrix movie was to showcase all of the tech that unreal engine 5 was capable of all of those elements that we mentioned coming together were present with even more features that we'll get into in a little bit it was an exciting example of what was capable for next-gen games in the engine itself in real time and like i mentioned it was running on the new next-gen consoles with the release of unreal engine 5 though you can download the open world city itself and play around with it in the unreal editor on pc and what's awesome about this is the fact that you can mod it and add things to it so already people are starting to create things with the matrix awakens demo for example this not superman game created by tyson butler we haven't had a decent superman game in years to be honest maybe this is enough inspiration for someone at dc to take a look and go actually yeah we should do this and one of the more recent showcases for unreal engine 5 was called the cavern and this was made by the coalition who are also responsible for gears of war and this does a great job of showing how incredible characters can look in unreal engine 5. it's a level of detail that we just haven't seen before in a video game it's far more movie quality they do make us fully aware though that it doesn't represent a game product but i imagine that that's been put there to at least temper expectations about a new gears of war game maybe it's a legal thing but come on this looks like a new gears of war game i'm here for it so the latest version of unreal sets the bar for game engines as far as i'm concerned and there are plenty of aaa studios who already have announced unreal engine 5 games in development ranging from official xbox studios cd projekt red have said that the next witcher game is on that gearbox 2k hellblade 2 stalker 2 the new tomb raider even dr disrespects new game studio midnight society have said that they're using unreal engine for their game 12 am and with the tools available and what we've been shown so far i'm very excited to see what all these studios are able to produce because this engine appears to truly be next gen and i'm hoping that these games look and play fantastic and allow the scope of the developers to massively scale only time will tell but i do think that the future's bright additionally to that what's really interesting to me about the engine is that it's not just about video games it's evolved way past that you may have heard of a little tv show called the mandalorian produced by a small company called disney well what you may not know is that the unreal engine was actually used to power the backdrop of a lot of the scenes in the show cgi is used extensively in television and film these days and as the mandalorian is a sci-fi show you can imagine that a lot of these scenes would need to be created with a virtual environment and this is often achieved by placing the actors in front of a green screen keying that out and then replacing whatever's in the background with the digital element in post-production obviously i'm no film producer but this does have some big issues that the film industry has been dealing with in one way or another for a long long time lighting is one of those issues and then you've got the problem of dealing with all that green that will naturally be reflected in the scene and you might see some of it on the edges of stuff if it's not keyed out correctly usually that's just the job of the post-production team to deal with and it can give them a headache but this is where unreal engine comes in and kind of saves the day instead of a green screen the mandalorian used huge led screens or walls and those walls produced a dynamic image that would serve as the backdrop for the scene being recorded and there can even be screens above the actors to simulate the sky and the lighting coming from it what's more impressive though is that the background can be changed in real time alongside the camera movements to simulate what the cameras would be seeing if the background were real one of the biggest advantages of all this is that the screens can also provide lighting that matches the source and to achieve all of this they had to tweak the camera sensors and led sizes on the screens to avoid that common issue that you get when you try to record a screen but arguably the most impressive part of all of this process though is the fact that because the visuals on the screen are being powered by unreal engine in real time they can dynamically change the scene including lighting or if they want they can completely remove geometry elements props or add more in you don't like that rock there delete it change it move it this means that the director could actually make changes on the fly depending on their needs and it also gives the actors an area of believability because rather than just being in a warehouse with a green screen behind them they can see where they're supposed to be if you've got disney plus i highly recommend watching the making of the mandalorian because it's super interesting and very enlightening into this process if that wasn't exciting enough for you though and sticking with the star wars theme by chance unreal engine is also responsible for the millennium falcon smugglers run ride at disney world and disneyland part of star wars galaxy's edge and this is an interactive ride taking place in the cockpit of the falcon and the visuals are powered by unreal engine it's essentially a giant simulator but you get to control to a certain degree where the falcon goes up down the engineers what you're shooting at what needs to be fixed even jumping to light speed and it all plays out in real time it's awesome to see something that started off as a video game and a video game engine powering a star wars theme park ride at disney now what's cool about all this is that the unreal engine editor is actually pretty straightforward to use if i can do it you can and it allows you to view and change your level while hitting play and testing it at any point in real time placing assets is simple enough in its basic form but don't be fooled into thinking that it's all that easy because it isn't it takes a bit of learning making a level may be achievable by most but games do require logic and usually logic means coding that's still the case with unreal but they also have an extremely powerful tool in the form of blueprints if you're a game programmer and you know programming in this case c plus then you can create your entire game logic using programming if however you don't have that knowledge you can utilize something called blueprints and this is a node based system that allows you to achieve similar things to coding but using visual blocks and strings it's entirely possible to make a full game depending on the scale and size using these blueprints alone but the bigger games on the market likely use a mixture of coding for the complex elements and stuff that they create from scratch but they will also use blueprints for simplicity where it's possible it's an extremely powerful system that still requires a lot of learning with the general flow of it and it's definitely easier if you've got a programming background but even a novice could pick this up another huge benefit to unreal happens to be documentation because it's been around for so long and so many studios now use it if you encounter a problem it's likely that someone has already encountered it and fixed it provided a solution or you've got so many tutorials out there as i mentioned the beauty of all this is that anyone can download unreal engine 5 and make something with it right now you me your nan anyone it's not just that but the unreal editor gives you a head start there are lots of templates for first person shooters racing top down third person and even virtual reality on top of that plenty of test levels that you can look at and learn from there's a ton of tutorials too and alongside that the unreal ecosystem features a marketplace full of content this content can range drastically though some of it is free in fact there's a lot of great content that you can download for free and other content will cost you money there are full assets that you can simply then drag and drop into your scene such as buildings of props as well as whole animation systems and in some case full game templates there's an abundance of content available for people starting out or even a triple a studio needing to get their hands on something specific it's also a great way to make and sell your own content if you're an artist the marketplace isn't your only source of project material though as the unreal editor has integration with quicksort mega scans now quicksort provide the best quality assets that you can imagine there are hundreds of assets on qixel ranging from rocks walls and vegetation that you can use to make a countryside scene all the way to food such as bread and everything in between and these assets are mega scans up to often 8k in quality quicksort also provides metahumans which i admit sounds a bit odd but the unreal engine has a creative tool that allows you to make digital humans for use in your game and this tool gives you full control over how a character can look and also allows you to import them into the editor and quicksort provides quite a few pre-made versions for you to use and to put the quality of quiksil into context games such as cyberpunk battlefield 5 metro exodus and the division 2 have used qixel to some extent when it comes to tv and film the mandalorian the lion king jumanji some examples all massive productions wrapping things up we haven't even really touched on this yet but the unreal engine is also used in other capacities architecture being one of them and the other being education what seems to be important to epic is inspiring up-and-coming developers supporting creators and one way that they can achieve that is with mega grants epic games has committed to giving financial grants that can range from five thousand dollars up to five hundred thousand dollars and these are for creative projects using the unreal engine this could be in any form as i mentioned architecture education but also stuff like film production and of course game development there's a member of my discord who works at a studio that managed to get an epic grant and they're building a game now what's more is that no matter the size of the grant you'll still own your ip and be free to publish it however you want and i mentioned it earlier too but it's worth mentioning again with the first version of the unreal engine there was of course a licensing fee but over time that system has changed and as of today you can use the engine to make a game and not pay a single penny to epic until you've earned 1 million you may never achieve that figure maybe you will but if you don't it means that you've got the ability to use a aaa engine for free and hopefully that enables many budding game designers and smaller studios to step up and make something cool maybe start their own careers in the industry and that's all for today i for one can't wait to see what real next gen titles will look and play like i feel like next month in june we'll get to see a lot more of them announced and some gameplay trailers too fingers crossed if you enjoyed the video leave a comment below and a like on it to help support me and bump it in the algorithm thank you and i'm going to leave you with this to spark your imagination a little bit more a spider-man demo i've been playing a few moments ago created by material in the unreal engine 5 matrix sample complete with web slinging wall climbing and more that's today what's tomorrow well we'll just have to wait and see
