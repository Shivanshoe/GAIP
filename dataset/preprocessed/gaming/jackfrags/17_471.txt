to prevent the vex from swarming europa up to no good basically naughty fallen are trying to use lovely milk to um entice the vets onto europa i wish they wouldn't their favorite uh christmas tree it's vex nog basically they just love milk but yeah last time i played on bestie on playstation was on the ps4 respawn restricted oh you've just been surrounded there um well the rocket launcher out look at them i've got apparently i got a good a good sword dropped oh you accidentally destroyed by who you know you know you get it again no problem with it before the barrier is down gold stuff you can always buy back from your like you're talking about it's not exactly it's hole in the wall thing right it's not it was just a legendary legendary i don't know thought of the dogs the sword of the dog oh he's a big lad i've got a grenade launcher i've killed myself instantly that's we've all learned a lesson today jack it's icy oh no that's horrible please yes son he's quite tanky that lad is [Applause] that's lovely work oh is that a good sword bonk that one uh let me have a look at it if it looks similar to my now it looks like a dark saber well it's currently because it's got an ammo it's invisible and um the one i had was a big thick boy look like this is the sword you want look at this one oh you can't you can't because i've got nobody ammo cinnamon i can see that i can see the outline over there the one i had was really really thick it was like busted buster sword careful of the jump puzzle that's all right we're seasoned at this time decent gamers the small lots of vandals around everywhere here what it's a big lad again oh acquisition here when you turn up when you master work your well any item adding like um target acquisition on consoles the instant head snapper does that actually affect your controller in some way well it just infects you all right it's been hammered i'm going crazy with that yeah he's got spin round like a madman here we go never down i hope people are freezing down here wouldn't it well i've got a nice winter coat on hang on if i switch my armor out it doesn't look like a winter coat right now look at the rough track guys wear the milk yeah it doesn't like a nice warm color that's um good milk you can scoop some up and make some cookies from amanda holiday yeah i don't want to make any cookies for amanda holliday any amount he betrayed me that's pretty mean she wants your cookies what she said to me someone's talking we're not listening you didn't pay any attention goodbye it's the milk for me then he took the milk i think we just uh have a big beam here very effective just show them the light oh yeah i've got some vanguard bounties of completing i've got loads you can actually set them as your um thing yeah they come up on the side then if you do that [Applause] oh this smg is nice hello that do you want the dark saber dude that does look sick it's electric is it okay yeah into the pits of the belk are we just going to be faced with a giant cow at the end is that where this is going i think so what the hell is this big cow dogs prairie isn't it that's lovely stuff got some enhancement cars wild hunt gloves the milk is decreasing yeah we've got to stay in this thing here and decrease the milk you gotta drain it it's too much too much milk the cows want it back so good kills meals that was a big chunky boy here look at this drain the milk tanks remind me of um batteries not included yeah classic those batteries not included don't you dare say you've never seen batteries got included what is it classic film classic classic what's it about boys yeah it is about toys really well actually it's about aliens it's about aliens they use that they use coke caps to make babies i'm so angry i wouldn't say aliens they're discs yeah they've come down um and they look like little robots flying saucers and basically they need to go home but there's some people that have like oh we want them they're cool they sort of stay with a family don't they they make babies yeah babies are like yeah earth attack is that a horror movie no it's a family little kids film there's some horror moments i'll be honest slowly boys oh i'll be honest i don't think it's that like iconic or you know i think it's great but it's it's certainly not like it's an 80s plastic i mean i can't i don't think it's as classic as something like let's say e.t i like it i prefer it sweetie it's definitely you know johnny five territory i think it's better than johnny five i'm gonna say that right now get the big one you guys just traverse the milk we are traversing the milk don't worry about those i know you have to kill the big boy wow i'm getting absolutely mashed yeah this is uh doing a lot of damage i'll rest i'm going to beam the big eye is the guy dead no he's still there look there is nice it's quite the beaming hmm i want to see i think we can leave now i know now we can move what's going on here imagine a giant robot jack now now you've imagined that robot imagine an even bigger one well i don't have to imagine it's right there belmont oh i'm getting away from there i don't you're down the side what are you doing there i'm hiding he's just immune is he i mean how do we do this shoot his shield flat i've got milk i've got milk i've got some vex milk for well amanda you just have to shoot him through the gaps are you inside him i know he's got away that one he's got like a damage check on him and once you damage him enough he goes away right put my needs in here look at that that's a lot of damage oh god no i shouldn't have done that yeah i killed his little mate before did those damage the sword oh yes i don't like those lads by the needle right here now the hydras can do one they're chasing me all right we're going in they can't chase you some blades matter yeah you're chopping that mecca yeah that's fine if you do the uppercut sword they're back it easily kills them very effective [Music] all right the lads gonna come back in a minute and then a big boy there he is just shoot any part of it oh he's gone look bye no milk no milk stop going in the middle i need to go in

have all the explosion kills as well oh exotic hello oh oh i got a darcy catalyst it's not exactly it's catalyst for this nice dancer that's posh indeed that's the sniper rifle i don't think it's that good a can lr2 and while we're here can't we just end the milk forever i think the milk is good existed like another dimension good job and there we have it i think the most important thing that we
