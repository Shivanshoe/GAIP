hi everyone hope you're all doing well today we are going to be attempting to unlock something related to call of duty zombies in black ops cold war i was sent a mysterious package yesterday in the mail and inside it was a camera from the 1970s and hidden inside that camera was a couple of notes a cipher and a usb stick so i unboxed it all i plugged it all into my pc checked it out on the pc was a file that loaded up this and i used the pieces of paper and the clues to decipher the access code to this which was shortfall and i've got terminal one now there are five other people in the world who have different terminals to me and they're all unique so i'm going to have to be involved with this and i'm going to have to try and solve puzzles and share my clues with the other guys that are doing this we've got noah j we've got sean j gaming we've got drift door we've got marley 13 we've got me and uh we've got mr dalek jd so i i wasn't sure if i was going to get his name wrong there i always say like jarlick daydee was darling jd i think all of those guys are streaming as well at the moment if you want to go and watch their perspectives but this will be my perspective now the only other thing that i can access at the moment on this website or on this terminal sorry is a an instruction that i was given on the piece of paper i was sent which was uh load signal r what number was it forgotten the number now one sec i think it was four six three load signal 463 yeah so if i type that in here load signal r463 we get this pawn takes pawn slash waves of attack and that is a website this website and apparently it's supposed to have just updated but it should update right away nothing's come up yet so i'm just going to keep refreshing this and the other guys that i'm trying to figure this out with are on discord so we'll be jumping in there in a second and talking to them because we'll have to collaborate but this doesn't appear to have updated at the moment the website is probably getting hammered right now nothing coming up obviously if you've been following along with this easter egg this website has unlocked the call of duty cold war reveal trailer along with the premise trailer we've also seen multiplayer as well which was all part of this and i think it's every week or so this is updated and there are various elements that you can click on there's even a choose your own adventure game on the pc so you can actually click on this terminal zero and if you enter zork it loads a choose your own adventure game so this is a really deep thought out alternate reality game but i'm involved with it and i'm gonna i'm gonna need your help to try and work stuff out and understand how to unlock whatever this unlocks the only thing it's got to be zombies it has to be related to zombies like i said it we've already seen campaign we've already seen multiplayer unless it's related to warzone which i don't think it is this has all been black ops cold war stuff so far it's not updated yet but i'm looking forward to this i can see you guys in the chat so if you've got any suggestions or ideas please hit me up because i'm sure that i'll need your support what's up guys hello lone assassin hello fletch wyatt victor what's up guys hey marcel raven lincoln what's up college sneaky potato how are you doing so i don't know if you guys saw a couple of the other guys involved with this did videos yesterday and that's what i was sent that's a camera some information and a cypher square but dalek jd got the name right that time he was sent a still camera still image camera and on his he's actually got a number scratched into it so i think that's really important and i think that we'll have to use that at some point but there was no number scratched on mine or anything there's nothing on this it's just a a camera bolex 160 hidden inside here was this stuff in the usb but i think that this will reveal call of duty zombies i don't know if that's going to be today it depends how far we can get but ultimately i think we're going to get a trailer or some kind of cinematic or information about the game so i'm hyped for this has the website updated no it does not like it come on whoever's running this update the website i'm gonna jump on discord and see if anyone's there hello and you guys here right now yeah i'm here right now um i typed in my code and said i need something from the camera that whoever got a camera so you typed in your code on the terminal yes my code from the pawn takes pawn like for for my set color i typed it in and it said i needed a code from a cable with a handwritten note a camera that has a cable with a handwritten note so okay who got the camera what the hell dalek got it do you well i have the number if you need it oh okay yeah sure okay so the number is five four five okay dash five four you said dash five four yep okay dash three seven seven five um that didn't work i'm gonna try to type in my first code again and see if it pops back up yeah you could try it without the dashes as well maybe so is there a new um a new web page that's popped up yeah well the regular pawn takes pawn website site if you go click on it there's a new tape it's a the open drop save restore tape and it flashes with different screens for all of our different terminals and we have to type in those codes okay i'm just going through and i'm screenshotting all the codes right now so i can put them in like imgur gallery so they're easy to access later save we've only begun to make our way through this amazing secrets how deep are you willing to go what paths will you travel what are the commandments will you learn and follow let's blow this conspiracy of okay every game has champions [Music] that everything you think you know is just a game the game of wars and lies cover-ups and disinformation secret operations that never took place grinding away their simulation every system has sweetness join me right this is the first one again drop save we've only begun to make our way through this maze of secrets how deep are you willing to go what paths will you travel what are the commands will you learn and follow let's blow this conspiracy up right so i think there are some images there that we need to look at like frame by frame and figure out what they are yeah hey okay i'm just going to roll a bunch of the oh you need to look at the cable yeah so yeah he needs yeah so this is oh i get it yeah i'm gonna need the drifter you're you're going through and you're screenshotting all of the the codes that are on the tape yes i'm trying to paste them into uh discord but it seems to just want to paste one at a time am i drunk how do i do a gallery hmm i'm not entirely sure uh yeah i'm not sure should item it um it's got i mean the link is for an album i'll just put it on twitter hold on hold on yeah i'm gonna match outside typing in a bunch of codes here i'm gonna uh maybe try and get a bunch of them and try them out have you done them all already drifter no i haven't i haven't i have noticed that the codes are color coded it seems like right oh yeah all of our different terminals are supposed to be different colors yeah i'm going to ask my chat to find the the one for me back in two minutes okay somebody on the web snapchat says they updated the printer on the website as well so i'm about to try my codes if i can find them in these massive screenshots okay wait what printer what uh the printer on the pawn takes pawn website yeah i'm not i'm looking i just don't i don't know maybe i need to read that's the first thing right okay i am going to play that back record it and then we'll go through frame by frame [Music] open drop save restore we've only begun to make our way through this maze of secrets how deep are you willing to go what paths will you travel what are the commands will you learn and follow let's blow this conspiracy up cool so i've got the recording of it there and open this up now see if we can screenshot all these codes [Music] so this is what i'm talking about with the collaboration we're all going to have to do different things in each terminal so i want to make sure that i don't miss anything so that's counter insurgency so if i save this to my desktop j7v4 and that's pink counter insurgency dash j7 v4 so that's the first one what was next oh man there's so many these are pink as well pink nav spec warcom what is this about nav spec warcom dash b736 now spec walcom i messed up that's fine and we've also got an anticipated target pink target that's hg73 okay so we've got three in one screen there i've already got that one i think that flashed yellow for a second didn't it maze that's just related to what he was saying okay here we go is that a regular irregular warfare tp22 that's red that's my color i think red irregular warfare tp22 and probably be a couple more here i imagine what was that you can barely climate change what okay here we go here we go irregular warfare red zone of fire dash seven six t six t3 and we've also got climate change red climate change dash m7h6 there's a couple of blue ones here hold on i'm just gonna unmute in discord because it looks like they've got something else here the same i have another see that first screenshot you sent yeah yeah yeah i've got that but like the pixels are all different i'll show you i'm gonna okay john those pictures are really useful because if you look i'm um i'm gonna i'll drop a screenshot in yeah you can see what i'm talking about but um yeah like your image is like your chessboard but they've filled in like gaps that i think you've got to overlay with what i've got so let me draw okay same with marley's if you see that okay wait i have i have a i have a suspicion here so if we overlay these chess boards and you can see where the pieces are if we knew what the pieces are we would know what the final move would be to checkmate and that could be one of the grid coordinates in warzone hello everyone i don't know morning no i don't know i'm going i think i've we've potentially got a a thread if you look in the chat one of my um codes brought up these four different chess boards and it looks like everyone else has like a chess board but it's you've got to overlay the image onto my chessboard and then it it like i don't know it will show stuff okay i i got modifiers for a chessboard so modify okay yeah back two minutes guys i'm going to type in my other codes in screenshot okay sounds good all right apparently something oh hold up the printer my chat is super pissed off at me for f sake read the printer the printer just gave us instructions yeah yeah it does the printer yeah the printer just that's right that's what i said i don't see a printer yeah if you go on the website and to the left of the computer there's like a little type writer printer thing you can click on it if you scroll all the way down it gives you like instructions and it says step one modify boards so i think that's what okay so that's what we're doing now is it just on regular pawn takes pawn the printer um go one to the left yeah go one to the left oh okay modified boards columns and rows wrap around when shifted oh i guess let's see step two apply grids yeah that's actually instructions isn't it yeah that definitely is instructions wrap around when shifted okay so we need i guess i guess first things first is to get everyone's screenshots yeah of what they got yeah i'm i'm working on it now i dropped mine in the discord everyone got three codes right yes yes okay get it now i've got screenshots from that old activision game the one with the helicopter yeah yeah okay columns and rows wrap around when shifted so i guess if they go off the side they come back around the other side copy image preview somebody just said noah's boards are the key to solving the boards so oh specifically yours so oh that's it okay so it's for the sides touch i think no let me make sure okay so i have all three of drifters good good good oh i'd have to type in my first one again to get it yeah i'm putting mines just in again so they're all in order for you yeah i'll you got a picture of a bat what are those bricks with like yeah those are bricks with crosses on them and we have a bat i've got a fireplace i think thousands of red eyes are watching you yeah what was what was like the messages that were also in um when you type in the code at the bottom yeah we should include those in the screenshots yeah there is a massive bellows in the room yes not sure what that means though uh bellows is like an ancient air conditioning is probably the wrong okay so it says the instructions noaa's has you can remake the boards with them c up three means move the move to column c and um the color up three that i'm not okay so i need to find a better way to show my monitor because i have so much stuff going on it don't want people to see all my adult films just hanging out on the desktop oh always a big risk mm-hmm oh baby someone in my chat just said a bellows is used to start a fire and jack has a fireplace yeah you kind of you move it up and down and it blows air onto the fire and stokes it yeah so are the pictures related to like a fireplace i got something that's my picture was on fire yeah right okay okay mine says it looks like something is written on the spire and my fire's burning it looks like a tp that's on fire okay yeah it does it does so when it comes to shifting the boards we need noah's codes because if you look at noah's codes it tells you um like where you move stuff okay yeah yeah yeah let's focus on these boards yeah let's focus on these boards then because the first step is the boards yeah john did you post your third image in this chat i don't see it yeah yeah yeah i posted my second and my third image i haven't posted the first one i'm about to get a picture of that okay we've got a fireplace we've got like a brick i have a camera my first image is a camera and it said that i needed to read something from a label a handwritten note on the cable that uh i guess one of you got i think yeah i got a camera yeah so i'm gonna put a code on it yeah is it on the cable wait wait john i think i don't think you posted your one of your images um i i don't think i posted them in order yeah i'm posting mine in order again i have your brick one and i have the uh the chessboard one what's the third one oh i put it in uh at 18 minutes it's the the uh thank you thank you all right i just put all three of mine in there all right i'm gonna okay all right that's so that's everyone's image is done so we're good on that sean have you posted all of yours yeah i just resent them in order so it wasn't confusing all three of them are in the discord okay so i got the modifier so i guess that's going to be used to shift the boards that would be my guess i wonder if that do you guys think the text underneath is needed for this or no um it could be potential clues but how i don't really know doesn't really make sense right now i don't think that we're getting things that are random so they have to be some kind of clue all we know is shifting the boards is the first step yes definitely that told to us so i'm so did somebody have all of our boards up already i think i saw a screenshot i gotta take a look at my chat they're pretty smart chat is so much smarter than these guys thanks chad we're trying i'd be useless with the chat honestly honestly okay so here so here's what we have for everybody's um we have two people or three people okay so marley drifter and sean all have modification grids john has the or mr dalek has the baseboards oh and uh and jack frags has the modification grids john has the baseboards and then i have the board modifiers so i think we need to start with john's boards i agree modify them with the uh with y'alls modification grids and then shift with my shifters yeah okay i am a hundred percent in agreement with you on this plan yeah that sounds like something we should do definitely like a smart person kind of thing what i'm doing is i'm i'm getting every single image and putting it in a photoshop document so we've got everything side by side john do you mind uh do you still have your boards up because the your obs thing like is kind of cutting through one of the stuff yeah sorry sorry let me let me henry send the board image it'll be great it has an embarrassing heads up i don't even have photoshop on this computer because i can't really like see colors so i've never had a reason to have it i'll do all of my editing in premiere you're a madman you're crazy when you can't see colors what do you need photoshop for oh hey give me one second now i'll drop it in oh my message treyarch twitter detracts isn't it oh because you tweet it out i was wondering how your colors are so sharp and you have because you guys have the usbs yours are a little bit more clear than the ones coming from our yeah yeah we're getting cheap better helps out a little bit what are the specs of the pcs you sent if they get like a rtx in them like i haven't had the new 30-90 okay people are spamming my chat about another part of the website could be updated let me see okay 11th hour let's see we've got the instructions so that's good no that's not updated hmm yeah this someone says the sticky note in the tv urls is different on you sure about that let's see so far uh no the ones that you posted on discord were they in that order no he's mute okay i'm just trying to get this going properly so that's all i know is so is there only three three boards because i me wait like the ones that we need to overlap is there only three e there's more than that also so here's here's another weird one i don't know why this is but the the pixels are not uniform like you know how in your editing and it's like do you want square pixels or like .95 pixels or whatever uh the pixels of my board actually don't line up with daleks board because dalek has different uh like pixel distortion on his old tech than i do on mine so this is going to be a bit of a challenge i don't know if that was intentional or not but it is annoying for sure okay well that's cool um how about i try another one of the digital boards that might wait somebody said wait geeky already tweeted out uh the shifted board what what our subs already beat that did the puzzle for it that's not wait wait wait wait what yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna send it it's on well i'll post a link from the twitter post he tagged jack in it and um let's see geeky's already done it i'm about to post you guys away that doesn't surprise me he's very smart there's this is the shifted board for jack what stuff are we bad at this are we bad [Laughter] i just got a donation that says hey brad can you hurry up and give the coordinates so we can drop in warzone [Laughter] uh i wish it was that easy yeah hold up hold on hey i'm going to try you need oh wait you said you need the okay he said he needs our grids so i'm going to go ahead and share my screen with you all right so this is marley's grid uh if you need to screenshot that oh boy are you person are you passing those along yeah yeah i'm passing them to uh geeky okay okay well we are really outsourcing this um problem so yeah let me let me know when you have that one and i'll go to the next one okay so we've got this wow all right she got it um this was mine oh i'm just you know what instead of me doing this manually i'm just gonna wait for you to or for uh geeky pastimes to fill this out i think that's going to be the easiest you just got green um that was marley's okay i'm gonna do is i'm gonna overlay i'm gonna overlay all right and this is drifters uh geeky this is drifter's board i mean it could be a qr code right ultimately as soon as they've done that before yeah it could and this is oh you already already posted jax so i saw i wait who who didn't i show you um so does noah not have a board no i didn't no i didn't have a board uh i think he just had the instructions right okay i'm uh yeah he had the instructions shown yeah i'm scrolling through the pictures i'm just trying to make sure okay all right so we have one board solved yeah yeah jack jack's board was solved yeah geeky tweeted somewhere yeah yeah you put it in the discord yeah yeah i put it in the discord i just put all the boards in my discord so my discord can help too okay i see that one let me open this back up all right let's see let's just stare at geeky past time and see what he's tweeting let's just every everybody's saying we need to get him in the call but we'd have to go in another nah let's just let's just blow up his twitter this morning yeah yeah well we're on the right track at least though um okay so my chat's saying that it looks like an 8x8 grid and even if we did four of them that'd be 16 by 16 which probably wouldn't be enough for a qr code so they're saying what it might be is pixel art like it might be making a character or multiple characters okay social media outsource everything yes yes we do these are terrible terrible puzzle solvers here okay so jack had the red board yeah that's right okay so is there only four boards total am i missing one because i only see there's only four that i'm aware of okay yeah four club chat so i just want to um understand the the method here that geeky used because i i'd like to understand obviously we're trying to work this all out live and he's using that information um so i'm just gonna draw what my grid was basically and then figure out how he uh how he did it it's not like it's so annoying that it's not a square it's really annoying i've never used google sheets before either so um please uh forgive my inadequacy this isn't as fun as car 98 headshots well is anything as fun as con ic8 headshots i mean probably not right car 98 headshots are pretty satisfying hey liam how you doing that's a winter guy oh you can just copy and paste these can you right it would be good if these were like the other way around as well wouldn't it as soon as that's kind of like can i just change this so it's so one is here yeah like i said i just want to understand how he's done this rather than just hey here's the answer see what they say on discord okay okay well i think we're getting some help right now what's going on okay so oh it's i'm here and what do you guys think this is going to make a qr code yeah oh that's insane if it does yeah this is making a qr code this is how then we're going to have to scan it with our phones probably yeah yeah it will take us to probably a new part of the website okay jackfrags okay my guy had to do his by hand delta change did it by hand oh lord i'm gonna try and i'm gonna uh try this on a google excel google sheets so how many boards do we actually need is it just three it's four four four four one thousand four yeah yeah four boards and then two instructions okay so do you do you mark the dots first or do you shift first i guess you mark the dots in this shift right is there one like some place where we can just draw our own qr code online like fill in the dots oh it's not a bad shout what would you do to type that in uh make your own qr code yeah surely that's it surely draw code generator yeah this does look like a qr code um [Music] oh wait a minute oh never mind i mean hmm four layer three what color are you doing though i'm i'm doing all of them i'm just it's just a slow process i just i just marked every single like dot using the grid i'm not supposed to er like i guess we can just inverse it if it's not right though um because i'm assuming the ones that are colored in those that's where they're supposed to be it's supposed to be filled in i'm guessing that's what i would assume that would be the black in the qr code right they said that it's spelling um words not so i don't think it's going to be a qr code i think it's spelling a word yeah chat says the smallest qr code that's currently readable is 21 by 21 and we could get this up to 16 by 16 at the biggest so so from the fir for the first one that we have with uh i think it was jack's picture they said that it's sl so it's probably all of ours together are probably going to spell it sl it's sl i don't see it hmm oh well drafted i've just seen that screenshot oh which one the the hand-drawn or the yeah the hand yeah yeah delta change you did that by hand because you just got a notepad with him as well so yeah photoshop is making this harder than it needs to be for me so that might be a play honestly hey do you guys want to play around with warzone while we wait on nowhere to photoshop everything bro yeah photoshop is like being more of a detriment to me right now you can use google sheets it's quite easy to do on there yeah i think that's a i think that's a good plan right said google shades google sheets sheets okay i was about to say i've never heard of google shades that sounds like fun times fun times new technology it's great [Music] so now are you doing sheets or should i open a sheet i i'm opening it up now okay so i'm gonna put in the one so geeky already did one of them good stuff do you want to make the uh sheet like public between the group so we can all work on like doing one bit at a time uh i'm using excel can you do that with excel yeah you can you can upload what you've got into sheets yeah and then we can always sheets is basically like excel but it's like online in real time oh gotcha i've managed to overlay green and red perfectly on the boards it's just now like the shifting part i'm a little bit unfamiliar with what the shifting part is supposed to mean no one's got the instructions on what how to shift it's just the actual process of doing it yeah it's just a tedious like what like basically you pl basically you i think you overlay the like shaded areas onto the boards and then uh after you do that you basically just have to um uh sh like whatever rows it tells you to shift you just like push them from section to section but what it's weird is like it says four to four three to five i don't exactly know what that is uh my chat says the shifts have to happen first modify the board before overlay in the printer screen oh is that is that the order that it gives i didn't even look at that so that's the number of spaces so move c up three spaces move four left four spaces g down five spaces uh so you move the boards and then you overlay things oh uh jack your board's apparently done yeah geeky's done it i think he's just he's just like properly finished though oh it's spelling like a letter yeah that's where he got the sl from oh there's another is that another grid finished i see that's that's the blue one blue one i assume that's mine so i've got my board uh jack's board jack's red right yeah red yeah so so it's the original image that uh [Music] jack screw is finished okay so so oh okay i say i cse yeah so this we just need to go through and do all of these [Music] man these are looking kinda mad yeah yeah they definitely they are that that that i don't deny you wait he just replied and said that might be slightly wrong he's trying to fix it oh i don't know which one which one the that blue the what the blue one i just realized the boards are numbered oh yeah board one two three four huh i did not let me take a look at that right so there they could be like uh on the right side the uh original before their modifications oh john only john's image uh shows the numbers right okay oh i'm gonna work on board uh four okay well there's all these numbers on the right it says 60 ard one two three four five sorry two three four oh no he said it's right he had to double check it's right okay okay so that one is correct that's good okay you guys in the chat thanks to geeky pastimes uh my board looks like that's a follow geeky on twitter oh did he just tweet yours drifter it's blue i don't uh yeah i think that maybe so which one is geeky done i don't i don't want to work on the same one he's working on yeah i need to i'm gonna just tweet at this guy to clarify i need to tab out so i can actually sign into my twitter somebody he said to pull up his uh i try i can't pull up his stream but if somebody house get enough internet to where they could listen to what he said i don't know how it is is he streaming yeah he's live right now oh no twitch twitch twitch okay cool i'll drop his link in there okay i'm gonna work on board number four while he's doing that these grids are gonna give hex codes i have no idea guys yeah people in my chat seem to think it's a it's a qr code geeky past times has 1500 people watching him stream right now holy crap he's going to town yeah he has more i mean i'm just sitting here offering vague observations um vague observations that are of no use to anyone pretty pretty pretty much same boat this is yours yeah i was trying to send like a clearer one if somebody because i know i sent it from like my computer because my colors so i just turned the saturation up to try to if it's because i know the colors matter that's why i sent it like that again because that my default color is showing like white i wish i knew all these shortcuts this is working actually john what is your thoughts so far um just your i i think once we've done all of this it's to me it looks like it's gonna bring up another url right that's to be a new part of the website because oh yeah he's using excel on his stream okay here's the deal guys we only that's this is only one part of the yeah of all the clues that we got today we still have to figure out why we have activision the first space airplanes and i needed the cable code or whatever was on mine for the camera is that yeah is that a legit old game or is that yeah i know that's a real that's a real old game yeah i thought so legit but like we've been given the instructions step one is to modify the boards and then columns and rows wrap around when shifted step two is then apply grids and then there's stuff about colors and then once the game boards have been properly modified and assembled they will reveal your next instructions three four five okay one two four there is a cable with a handwritten level wait do you have that you have that same message drifter no i'm reading yours i'm trying to make sense of them since i can't really do anything useful in this regard i'm trying to look at these and see if there's any so they all kind of follow the same pattern you get it loads one image and it says cadet level and every image appears to be something from a game like even even the bellows and the fireplace and the bricks kind of look like old text adventures like noah's with the bat looks like some old like vampire game that you would just type in commands like stab or walk or whatever yeah yeah but i think for mine i don't i still don't know what was on the cable is there a note on your cable uh no no and that there's a random set of numbers are like etched on the back of the camera yeah so i tried to somebody told me that earlier and i tried to type in those but maybe i need to try it in a different way i'm not three goes six to the right one two okay so uh did everybody's have like a code on it because i never saw a code on mine on your wall on my computer my computer oh no no but you had a code on your computer wait to get inside of my computer no you said on the cable oh no i was asking about the cable from his camera because that's what my message says that there's gonna be um there's it says it's a cable with a handwritten label so i'm assuming i need what's on that noah yeah with the instructions obviously with red it's like seven to one what's the methodology there are you moving one of the squares from seven to one like what are you actually doing there um i i think it's basically row so like for instance e down five i think that's basically like column e you shift it down five and then you shift column three to the right six and then d down one and that should show like what what it's supposed to be but how do you get that from that simple instruction seven seven to one seven to one yeah which board is this for like on the red board for example uh i that's just my guess i think that's how it works because if you go to the if you go to the site it says modify the boards so basically i think you just i don't think the red and the white or the like dark squares and light squares actually mean anything uh on the chessboard that's just the grid really the only thing you need is the uh the modification for the board because i mean the chess board is the same every time it's the same board yeah it's just so really you're only working with uh with the other thing i'm already i'm working on the magenta board board number four right now okay uh it looks like geeky pastimes is almost done with board number three go sorry sorry the blue board apologies the blue board that's old number two okay so noah's working on my board right now and i am streaming other people's streams this is the life this is it yeah me and you just kicked back right i'm gonna see if i can talk to geeky and understand the methodology here because i'm not picking it up i'll see if i can get hold of him he did that so quick one second just have to send him a dm bear with me one second guys so get hold of him on his stream so this is geeky pastimes he's uh he's very good at uh figuring stuff out um he's the guy he instantly figured out the red one i just want to understand how he's done it i'm very confused about where this dust off things come from because it doesn't look like this is what we're doing no they're not going to see it it's fine um but someone explain this to me should we still move forwards yeah i think we should still do this personally i think this still needs to be done but i don't know for sure we don't need that anymore so jack frank's looking my stream now so i know how it's like i know how to do this bit but i don't understand what we're going to do with this bit i'm going to finish off this quickly i'm just going to do this one so we can see if we can work out where dustoff comes from i think we need something if hey jack if you want to uh me to explain anything just say did you i think he knows that i'm watching yeah yeah yeah it's fine jack frank's just asking if uh i'm up for cool on discord so i will just pop to the webcam very quickly while i put that on but yeah i'm very confused about all this there we go hey man hello how you doing that's super crazy to actually talk to you but yeah good thanks hey man hello how you doing that's super crazy to actually talk to you but yeah hey sorry i just accidentally uh disconnected from the call so yeah do what do you want to know i just want to understand that the how you applied the instructions to the cool yeah yeah i could do that so um have you got my stream yeah i'm watching it now yeah so you get like this bit in the bottom left corner that's just what the grids look like when you start yeah so it's just a little bit behind sorry that's okay so there's like the boards that just look like chess boards essentially they're just like checkerboards that's kind of the boards that you start off with okay right so it's playing an advert now as well enjoy the ad revenue thank you um yeah so the boards that you do that you side with i think dalek had them on his screen yeah he got four boards yeah they're just checkerboards then you know i had instructions for each of you so different ones for each color you were red uh right so you had the red instructions so you're not showing it on your screen by the way sorry just a heads up oh cool your chat are going crazy yeah yeah if that happens there we go it should be sorted now um so this is the instructions that noah had yeah and what you do with those is you move the board by those so when it says c free you just literally move all of those squares up by free and it sort of um gives you a slightly warped version of the board so you move the c column up by three and then you move the fourth row left by four then the fifth one down by five and i'm just doing the blue one right now and that's what this gives you so once you follow those instructions of just moving that column up moving that row to the left and then moving that column down you end up with an image that looks like that yeah so you're just shifting the row or the column based on the instruction perfect and then you have this which is the grids that um i think you guys got from putting in your codes you then have to overlay that with this and basically if a cell if like one cell has a color or has a gap then it turns into a color and if it's different then it turns into a sort of black part so a part that's kind of um that doesn't have anything in it and those black parts are the bits that are spelling the letters i see yeah so that looks like sl or something yeah and that looks like it could be like hd or nd or something now my problem is people have suddenly come up with this extra link dust off and it's like i've got no idea where it's come from because it's obviously not from this dust off so that's a new link on the web takes pawn so that takes you to this where we've got something to submit airborne jump orders right okay you've got the game in the background there as well yeah and you guys had um screens from the game screenshots didn't you like this so we have to do something with this to do with those instructions i'm guessing right so when it says scanner stack to reveal rendezvous point i don't know if that means that we've got to overlay all of these or i don't know reserve helicount indicates pilot manual page i'm guessing there's a manual for chopper command that you'll have to find a manual thing then it says heavy latitude positioning so that's which because this is a grid isn't it like these old games run on a grid yeah so i'm guessing you could work out how far across it is why helicopters jumped twice he had a hope because yellow helicopters jumped three times the mission score indicates the letter index oh okay okay okay so this makes sense so you find this page based on this so this will be page six how how is that link been discovered though i don't know i don't know where that's come from people just started spamming it in my chat saying that there's dust off and i've got no idea where from oh there we go someone said how we got to dust off red gives the letters sl and the top of hd blue gives the letters a s and the top of us also it says slash dust off right that the basically my discord finished that the squares they finished all the squares because that took me ages to do your one okay so that's definitely basically yeah so they finished all the squares and there you go stuff okay so all right so we can just forget about the squares now that's done yeah yeah so we're done with that so now we need to use the pictures from the game this yeah so we need all of the screenshots of the game um if you could get the other guys to like put up their screenshots that would be super useful or put them on twitter or something yeah i think they've posted them on uh on the discord i'll see if i can get them to share them they probably will i know yeah that'd be awesome and then yeah and then i sort of understand we need the chopper command manual and then this will get us to find a letter and i'm guessing each of you will have one letter and we put that code in here do you know anyone with the chopper command manual i'm sure it must be online somewhere right yeah yeah for sure all right cool um well i'll learn i'll let them know then that it's pretty much useless oh it's enough page numbers yeah oh man pilot manual page yeah that is an old school manual right there this is what has been written by one guy but there's no page numbers at all we need one with pages um all right dude uh well thank you for explaining that yeah no worries that's very kind here i appreciate that have fun yeah i appreciate you stopping by it's absolutely awesome good luck with your uh australia i'm sure you're gonna absolutely just solve everything before we've even got past step one there we go all right catch you later he's good dude right let's get back on the call with the other guys hello we can compare in terms of like score and everything else so if we take a look at every one of these there's quite a few helicopters but there's always one yellow one right so the the little thing above the activision logo is the uh scanner scanner stack to scanner stack to reveal run it rendezvous points yeah so the yellow chopper is your chopper yeah yeah but if we if we look it's facing left in every shot apart from one of them that says five two one okay you guys moved on from the squares down right yeah you're on the dust off thing yeah yeah yeah yeah just around i know exactly how we got there but that's where we're at for sure it was easy i did that in like five minutes it was the when you put the squares together they just spelt slash dust off yeah that's i think the the discord guys figured it out like way before we so the scanner is the thing at the bottom above the activision logo with the yellow dots and the red dot surely the cadet level has something to do with it it's referenced in the manual too good that lovely yeah yeah it is so much enter stack to reveal rendezvous point i don't know what that means maybe oh no oh no okay this is going to be very hard um i'm pretty sure if you like perfectly overlay all of the scavenges it's going to spell something no which sucks because we all have different resolutions and yeah sizes and qualities of pictures mine is just a camera point on the screen oh yeah oh yeah i saw you saying earlier that you don't have a disc but you only have to plug the usb in and it works that's how i wanted to yeah it works without the disc yeah but we can just if we take one of the pictures from obs like one one of our guys that's got the uh the file on our pcs wouldn't it be much easier then to work out what that grid size is of the scanner and it'll be consistent across all of them right yeah yeah oh yeah well yeah for you guys because ours is all over the place like mine doesn't even show the proper colors but your guys's colors are like the exact way they're supposed to be can we get a program emulator real quick y'all got them emulators yeah i got games on your phone right i'm trying to cut out i'm cutting out the ones that we can actually yeah the ones that are really nice yeah let me know if you need a better screenshot or whatever i'm already killing that one i'm trying to launch the game here but it doesn't seem to want to let me yeah draft it out i may just play that game with you the problem is i can't seem to yeah find out how to start it don't know if i'm allowed to search that but chop up command on line three stop playing it on stream i don't need to work out the code wait i think the blue is completely broken like it's not showing any blue for the stream that's crazy ah yes i've cracked the cut you got it i overlaid them and it just looks like nothing oh no so it's not that then well no no i think it is it but the problem is it's missing half of the data because because they have a red dot that allows you to align them you know what i mean like kind of kind of how they did for the first reveal they had like that red dot to align them with each other oh yeah yeah yeah oh okay that's it the red dot in the scanner yeah so yeah again okay the the instructions on the uh the jump orders on dust oh god this is so fast we have to look at the scanner and then look at the screenshot and then figure out what dot on the scanner is which vehicle in the game like which helicopter for example you get what i'm saying so it says white helicopters jumped twice so i assume we would find that white helicopter on the scanner and move it up twice yeah you get what i'm saying yeah i think yeah yeah i think i get it that does that does make sense yes it looks like it looks like my theory is right i think i think the uh the dots are lining up and uh it looks like it will spell letters but the problem is we getting our pictures it's just we've got to figure out the grid size of that scanner exactly what it is i've overlaid two so far and that's about it i got i got three it's definitely like gonna be an e and then an f i think over here or maybe numbers i don't know draft oh yeah sure okay so when you realize how critically unprepared i am for all of this oh nice chill so we need better pictures from me sean and drifter i think that is literally the best picture i can get because i mean i'm taking the one directly from the stream but it's the colors are all wrong so i hope we don't need them that's fine the colors aren't needed i can i can take a picture of one that has i can take a picture with my phone if the one that i sent in isn't good enough just laying them up as best as possible you know i'm about to put uh the screenshot of what it looks like of my appropriate merits i mean you can look he can't even see oh my god that's so bright and i didn't i tried to like change the colors around and it looks even worse so that's why i mean i guess i could try to take a better one from my phone that's our only option here that's the best i'm gonna get from the phone the other one i can grab and drop in me a moment i had it up here earlier it's on the chopper command right now i should just be able to take a screenshot of it give me a moment here just terminal 5 yes all right so i that was the best angle i could get from my phone so this is what i'm sending is a screenshot straight from the capture device as best i can get and my monitor doesn't even show all these colors like you can't even like if you look at my monitor you can't even see the position of the dots and stuff so hey at least you're getting colors i'm not even getting those i don't know how you're wait is that an obs how did you get those to pop up on your screen uh so i used the included video adapter thing yeah i have that plugged in yeah you can use that and the color output on that is going to be different than what you see on your screen do you have that thing all like installed and ready to go no it's it's plugged in and i'm showing it on my obs right now but it does it's not showing those colors that i can't help you with oh uh hit the button on your screen there's a there's a button on your monitor that turns color on and off try hitting that one yeah i put it in the discord what it looks like in my uh obvious i don't know if anyone else is like clocked but my chat's been spamming it and it makes a lot of sense is that we need to order the scanner images uh or overlay them in the order in which each screen has lives so like one of them has one life then the one that has 521 school has two lives then there's yours drifter that has three lives correct then shawn's has four noahs has five and a mine's got six i think they need to be overlaid specifically in that order and then it should give us the end result boy this is gonna be challenging time to see what premiere pro can do holy crap shawn those colors are um impressive thank you um i mean i'm using the provided cable and that is what they look like i i'm pretty sure the computer's just i don't know i believe you you're still impressive old technology right fun wait did wait i remember you saying are you using are are you using one of the red cables because all mine is yellow i'm using uh no i'm using i'm using yellow cable oh okay yeah my yellow cable still looks like that so how about we getting on because i'm i'm losing my mind a little we need to ascertain the grid size of the scanner i think yeah yeah some of the matchups saying this 8 high and 32 along 8 by 32 okay i don't know how that's just based on a random person in the chat that could be anything but it sounds like something that could be right benjamin yeah i thought it was full can you sean can you see the numbers above your chopper uh yeah i sent a picture it's 626. i can see it on my monitor on like the regular screen it's just not showing an obs correctly so i see the colors on the the computer that we have but that's why i put that screen that's the best i could do i took a picture of the actual monitor okay that's probably what i'm going to use here then does anybody know someone that worked on chopper command that could tell us the exact resolution of the scanner on the bottom of the screen no nobody anyone got one of those friends just hanging around somewhere so to fill out to solve this puzzle we just do a simple overlay i think i think what we need to do is figure out the exact grid size of the scanner and then we can figure out which dot relates to which helicopter and then we can use the instructions to move those dots if you see what i mean in in the correct location and then overlay it because if we just if we just overlaid the images because every unit has a unique instruction that wouldn't work if you get what i mean yeah so on on my image for example of the scanner certain helicopters have to do one thing but other helicopters do another so some might go up and some go down so just overlaying it wouldn't work so the scanner on the highest quality thing is 55 pixels like height wise is that from your screen no that that's that's just taking the image putting it in photoshop and counting each individual pixel oh man ah our savior oh thank you thank you thank you oh my gosh yeah i mean like 30 minutes sooner would it be cool but yes is that all of them yeah that's the ones we're missing from the non right okay oh oh wait i've i've just checked the chat okay yes okay we've been saved a message from on high okay so we need the so who did not have the who had the emulators jack had the emulator and then john did right yeah okay so we need this there's an interesting one in the chat the game screen shows one mile and the scanner shows five miles um i see i assume the order that these have been sent in they are lives four five and six from top to bottom so what was the instruction for life four oh no i thought we were just overlaying every single one but i don't think that would work white helicopters jumped twice so on that bottom one for example that white helicopter on the scanner i assume that's just this the yellow square on the left the big yellow square right or is that am i reading that incorrectly oh it was is it the one on the right is that one kind of looks like a helicopter i'm trying to understand what the scanner what is what on the scanner if you see what i'm saying right i'm there with you because if you look at the bottom one on the right hand side there is like a fat l and that kind of looks like a helicopter right but then why would the helicopter be lower down than the than the trucks it's so confusing okay i'm trying the overlay method now to see if see if it works oh no even these are different resolutions you kind of need rest of all six yeah that would uh that would really be it i'm tempted you know to try something a little different instead of over instead of overlaying is cut all the yellow squares out and then overlay it that way that way there's no like other colors that are you know having a mess about with opacity on each layer um i want to give that a go well mini maps weren't very good back in the day were they okay so my chat says you have to overlay the scanners to get one piece of info and then you have to use that info to solve a cipher i need i wish that's what i that's what i'm thinking so so do we need the the same size pictures but the other ones that aren't here because that would be that would make it a lot a lot easier yeah if they're all the same size same resolution we're then we're talking all right it's something right i'm cutting out all the squares um and then just lining it up but there is no background so we can get a very clean image of what okay it's spelling that's that's the hope that it will work out looking like that please which ones are you doing dalek are you doing the three that we've just been given or yeah i'm starting out those are the only three that are the right size well i'm starting out with that and then i'm gonna try the others okay can't you cut the codes above activision then overlay them in what with each front each one in front of the other giving you the code that's what i'm trying to do yeah i've cut out four and five i'm doing six right now i'm just cutting out the yellow squares and then the red square and then just lining them all up so there's no like brown background yeah i'm going to work online for you john and then just send you that and then maybe we can just scale it up to the correct resolution or something yeah yeah that'd be wicked i'm just going to speed it up and drop it do that and drop it in it's like a png yeah it'd just be just go right over it yeah i'm pretty sure it's making a word i just took the three that are close to the same resolution and chopped them up in premiere and took a look and it kind of looks like a pixely word i think the second letter is a i just need the rest of these bad girls okay i asked nicely you did asking you shall receive i'm waiting can we just get the solution okay even the dots don't line up on me i'm so confused man they're different the dots are different sizes the red line up properly yeah wait i think somebody else has a link already please please please please how have they done it that quick understand what's you know what i'm not going to ask questions great instructions for the game it says bat decoder which is the other thing we need though yeah but then there's there's an arrow on the right yeah i'm pressing the arrow oh wait there's a full here's the manual we were talking about wait didn't we already pull it up though this might have the code on the back okay uh i'm gonna click over here wait is there something i can click on in the screen you can go across if you click on the very far right this one are we sourced hey okay so i'm gonna are we supposed to look at the words that are redacted because we have the unredacted words already yeah we have the manual from online yeah i'll put it i'll put it in the chat again but this cadet level is one player two players okay so i think i think basically this is what happens if you overlay everything yeah it would give you you get this so now we need to use the images to solve it so and then we do this in order i guess so marley you go the first reserve helicopter indicates pilot manual page so page one is marley's page yeah okay which i guess is the cover since page two is yeah okay um heli latitude positioning and direction indicate order and jump direction latitude and wait what oh man do you guys think that the redacted words are making like a sentence maybe we're supposed to put all of those together since i don't know yeah why would certain stuff be redacted that's what i'm saying like should it all make have you got a link to the manual online is that yeah i put it in the discord that's what i'm trying to figure out is oh yeah can we just all right let's try clicking on basics let's see activision so before creating is the first thing i'm going to try to put all these words together that are redacted yeah the top line is um the object of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible and so that's the score that's the lives what is the latitude positioning and direction indicate order and jump direction your oh it says your letter index is where you start on page one that's that's what that's what my chat says so the letter index is where you start on page one whatever that means yeah people are saying the matchup yeah start on the 121st ward stuff like that but the fact that that's that the very end makes me think that's where the letter goes in the word that we're spelling out because i i think basically we're we're trying to figure out like we find a letter and then the order of that letters is determined by the score because the because the mission score is the very last line okay i think that that's that's my theory anyway scanner stack to reveal rendezvous reserve helicopter manual page i don't know what the latitude positioning is that's what i'm is it the number on top of the screenshots of chopper command it's like 429 on drift or sean's was six two six or was that do you think that's score i think that's good that's cool yeah right oh no no hold on hold up delta change is sending me messages here check this out says letter index is the starting position so you would do 121st letter and basically you jump left or right from the position of that letter to get the final one so i don't know what letter that would be but what's the what's the first helicopter what color is it um just helicopter on what uh the one that we're doing right now marley's page what what color is it's uh i guess they're all yellow yellow yeah yeah yellow all the player helicopters are yellow yeah oh boy so the yellow one would move would jump twice jump three times white helicopters jump twice the helicopters to jump three times indicate order and jump direction i get jump direction would move it forward so it's facing left so it would go left right yeah yeah why helicopters jump twice but you all have white chocos you have to have them all what do you mean i think yeah what the heck do we do with all the white choppers that are just flying all over the place um the instructions include the white helicopters though right oh wait well i guess it doesn't really matter at the end i think maybe the latitude is you do white helicopters jumped so basic oh okay so i think basically what it's saying is you need to read left to right so you do the yellow copter yellow helicopter you jump three times so uh just for the first place for marley's page you do white helico uh okay so you start off doing three jumps to the left for the yellow helicopter and then you would jump two more times to the left for the white helicopter facing left and then you jump two to the right like i said at the end of the day it doesn't really matter the order you do it since it's like a just a net left or right jump um so yeah i don't think the order actually matters as much like the latitude doesn't matter but it's the direction that matters so for the first one you go to the 121st letter and then you jump three times to the left that's it okay okay so now we have to count out the letters i need to count out individual letters on page one on the manual yeah so go to the the unredacted manual and then count those uh so i have 429 to count through yeah oh please no oh my god yeah we can't even the unredacted one we can't um i think we should i think we should work with the redacted one yeah because yeah like they redacted it for for a reason yeah yeah because the words are like specific words that i i just tried to figure out do we start with activision chopper command at the top do we start at the blurb of text i'm guessing you would start at the blurb of text yeah now it's oh yeah so yeah he's not technical as page one that is page one okay so we're gonna do some reading of letters let me let me zoom in wait i know is this right because the la who's code shawn's is 626. i can explain um if you just you can explain what about someone saying page one letter 21 does that make more sense well that would make things easier yeah that would make things easier because the reserve heli indicates the pilot manual page so we're getting the page number from the number of lives left i don't think they want us to count six hundred something characters i think we're so what would be what's the highest number we have is it six six hundred twenty six twenty yeah and how many pages do we have to work with like nine no sex just six yeah right we could try both theories if we wanted if we go with the we count 120 odd characters or or is page 1 21 characters in yeah what are you classing as page one the front cover front cover yes yeah because the next one's and then sides number two uh we could add the numbers together to be much more reasonable yeah yeah everyone has three numbers fifteen so someone's just made a good point on my chat wait yeah that is a cipher did they say that because somebody said that to me no they said that um noah's one of noah's like first initial images was of a bat and now we're on a website that's bat dakota i noticed that yeah somebody said that it could be the letters like you're like the one two one means first page second line first letter type thing yeah mine is a six page second line six letter yeah cause if you look at page six there's not that many words on it wait wait it says one one is one line two two words i'm just going to try and lean on mine's 3-3-1 so are we just looking for individual letters here all of a sudden i think it's going to take like all one letter individual letter yeah it will and then so first page yeah second line first letter is a y and then we're doing that minus three so it's hey man hey what do you make of this next step then okay so if you've got my stream on here yeah yeah so i i don't know i'm just working on this one because it was the one i had in front of me so we know that's page six here like that makes sense um we know we've got this page the bat thing back to code that's fine headed attitude positioning and direction indicate order and jump so that's fine so these are in order so it's top to bottom because it's latitude and the direction that's right that's left and that's left okay so it's like um we know kind of what the jump what that means and then white is jumped twice yellow yellow helicopters jump three times that all makes sense except i don't know what a jump is i don't know what it means by jump um when we said mission score indicates letter index we thought okay if this is page six then if we go to page six on their version of it three free one could be the third row the third word the first letter so that would be p and then if you jump two to the right that would be s three to the left would be u and then two to the left would be y that spells p s u y which is the last page that doesn't make any sense because there's no word to end in sui so i think we're kind of along the right lines but i don't think that's how you do it um the other guys were suggesting 331 could be like from the start of the manual the 330 first letter but the problem with that is you wouldn't end up on the sixth page because there's like 500 pages per letter yeah and also that's my page it's an unreasonable amount of counting to do really yeah we did find a way to do that in google docs we found a way to do it like automate that a little bit because you can just like put it in and then select it but the problem is then we don't know the other problem of doing it that way is we don't know if you include titles like if you include numbers um like things like that just mess it up too much i think there's too much uncertainty whereas if it's line word letter yeah that kind of makes more sense but but it just the jumps don't matter i don't know if you have s-u-y at the end i don't think that makes sense or it could just be a code like the whole thing could just be a code it won't necessarily be words well it's bat decoder yeah that's that's the web page and that's obviously a reference to um noah's image in some way although noah's image didn't really have anything else on it it was literally it was just a picture of a bat with red eyes and then it says a thousand red eyes are staring at you something like that but you know i just thought that was like a reference to like people watching a stream yeah or it could be zombies right like red eyes oh yeah yeah so there's nothing really else on that picture no i i think if i'd be interested to do all of the images the way we're doing it yeah and just get these codes and then see if they make sense so that's a jump a jump could be a line up right like directly above if you see what i mean but there's specifically they say it they show the order so it's left or right like the the um direction of the helicopters is the direction of the jump um i'd be interested to see whatever so i don't actually have the other things i don't know someone's put them in discord i think but um what the other chopper command images yeah i've got another one here so this is the third one so the third one says um when it was the page page three and this would be 429 so that's 9 4. the other problem is that this would only use the first 10 lines of all of them yeah um what do you make of the redacted stuff do you think that's just styling i think so like it doesn't make a sentence or anything like that like you can't read them on and also that would be incredible planning if they could find a way to do that they started doing this in the 1980s if you actually look at what the redacted words are as well they don't really have any relevance to what this is i mean one of the last ones is like copyright copyright atari or something yeah which is weird so if that was oh yeah okay this ruins that so it's definitely not line word letter because the fourth line second word is of and then the last number is nine so that doesn't make sense either seven of nine it's a star trek crossover we need jane way here um yeah so that so it's definitely not line word thing so that's good that's at least ruled for something out but i just yeah i don't know what jump means and i don't know how we're meant to find the letters those are the two things that we're missing at the moment like if you do that it'll be pretty easy i also don't know what this needs like i don't know what the submit thing is asking for why don't you put something wrong in it just input was not correct fine mission score indicates so that's the mission score is obviously the thing at the top and that's oh oh wait so wayne what if this is what i was doing originally was moving pages so if this was the third page and then it's um this again doesn't matter so three to the left would be the three two one sixth page and then two to write and to draw it would be fourth page yeah the fourth page start be the fourth page then for two that does have nine letters one two three four five six seven eight nine it would be a so that one would be a if that was right um the problem with that is that it means that the order of the helicopters doesn't actually matter because it's just a maths thing you're just either adding or taking away a certain number so this one would be number six then if you go two to the right assuming it wraps around would be two three to the left would be um one six five and then to the right would be and then two to left again would take us to three so we're back on page three and then three three one on page three is three three oh so i could do this this could work that might yeah that might work actually so i just need the i just need the other images the whole the whole images or just the scanner command images one second so my chat is being spammed three numbers for three headings each heli is a jump for one number so page six goes to three three one three equals third letter the first heli is white and facing right so you jump two times so it's the fifth letter isn't that kind of what you were doing then yeah and my other problem with that is that then you're using the instructions out of order which i don't think they want us to do i think they want us to do everything in order so we would do um i'm just trying to see if anyone's supposed to think yeah so i think the letter index must be the last thing that you do let me see if i can get the other images for you one second you so they're obviously not to scale some of them are taken from oh yeah that's about it no problem but yeah um if we yeah if we've got all of them then i could solve them fairly quickly so that one's that one's free yeah i've got i've done that i've got that one already okay yeah i need one two four and five we've got six four so four was drift doors uh this one here hmm again i'm not confident this is right but like and normally when i start saying there's someone on my doscore channel will work it out before i do oh wow that's hard oh but that says it's page free as well well so which ones i i suppose you could have multiple you don't necessarily have to use all the pages that's the same image that's the same image it's just different colors they're both four to nine of course yeah that's weird that they're like so different but you've got the same thing it's because he's um he's taking a picture with his phone and he's also got it hooked up to his lbs oh i see oh so that one was drifters yeah i see yeah goddess weird how different they are like shows what crt does to images that's crazy so you've got six and i've got six and three right so this one is sean j gaming's this is number four you need this one yeah uh one sec and it's kind of you don't have that one right no i don't have that one so that one is six two six on page so page four but then three to the left is page one two to the left would be page five and then two to the right is page one again so that's page one this one might help me solve it so that's six two six is even no there's not six lines so you've got six you've got six she said or do you need six no i need um i've got yeah i've got six i've got six three and four now do you need one and two yeah yeah oh and five yeah so this is number one thank you so that's four three to left is like three two one two to the left is six five that's six one okay yeah that's one let's try i need to work out this one so if it's four and then three to the left that is one two to left again it's five and two three is one again and then that doesn't work because there's no sixth line on page one oh unless this counts as a line one two three four five six six two six one two three four five six s okay i still can't try this then so four would be s uh that was one so one is two to the right which is three three to the left which is six two to the left which is four and then that's there's two i just gave you two thank you uh so it says page one so you go to left which is three three to left which is six and then two to left which is four so page four one two one one two one would be t so that one would be t like this doesn't look like it's spelling a word uh so what was the one you just gave me was two so that's two so that would be two is three four then back to two then up to five so that's five and five two one five two one two three four five two one see kind of checking i've done this right with the other ones now because i've got i'm including the titles did you uh do it was that then that's two so yeah the last one cheers so that's two and then that goes three four oh wait that's the one i just did i think oh no there was um have you got the the fifth one the one with number five on it so that's what i'm missing let me have a look tk not sure if there was a five actually oh really yeah i would have assumed each of you would have got one of them i assumed all of you got a chopper command page i think so i'm just looking through the images now which one did you get i got uh which one did i get i've got so many documents open i've got so many windows open right now it's crazy i can actually get rid of a few of these now i don't need those anymore yeah just got dangerous um i better check my stream in case people are saying something apparently you can play chopper command on black ops 2 nuketown what the hell well i mean not many of us are going to have that in store though yeah i do actually have it stored on the pc right i've got it on i could maybe yeah i had number two okay so you had the two ones okay i've got five i've got five here oh okay yeah it was uh noah's okay god imagine if we ever to actually play chopper come on right there we go so that last one is five and then so that's five then if you go three to the right is um six one two two two to the right is four to the left is back to two oh he's covered up the number he's covered up the score oh who would be like a person three seven four three four yeah it's three seven four or three seven nine i think it's a four it's a reflection office elgato key light i think oh i see six one two so that's two so it's page two three seven four page two one two three one two three four five six seven what was it seven four or nine and neither of those work three seven four yeah neither of those work because the word is and damn it one two three four five six seven yeah it doesn't work it just depends if we're using the titles or not um and it does yeah it doesn't work even if we're not using the titles actually so that's the only one that doesn't actually fit that theory well yeah i mean it doesn't spell a word either it just says like picasso at the moment but um yeah it does it doesn't i can't find a way to make that work so maybe that's not what the jumps are maybe we don't know but thank you for giving me all the numbers trasco castro oh castro that's not a bad shout that's the sort of thing it could be yeah that seems a bit too obvious though doesn't it trying it nope good try yeah castro makes sense what if you're jumping from the redaction but i don't know why there's lots of redactions and i don't know how he'd start yeah castro doesn't work it's a good try though i just don't the what they did before when we got stuck on these ciphers is they gave us like a clue page a little bit later it was like an hour of trying and then they gave us another page which like helped us because we got stuck i don't know if they'll do something like that because i need them to change the orders really to make the jumps make more sense like we understand that we understand the reserve heli account heavy latitude positioning direction include order and jump direction like i said the mission score i'm pretty sure i think we are doing it right i just think so it's the only thing i can see it makes sense there's a new vhs tape no there's not i checked i just checked okay yeah people in chat just keep posting like we don't need to go through the redactions the way we're doing it the reductions don't actually matter there aren't any redactions on the lines that these are pointing to so this one i think the jumps might if they're not pages i just don't go what else they can be step three words i think that's 100 correct because out of all the images there's there's one to six right and there's one to six pages in the manual so yeah it just has to be that's that's the most obvious thing the reductions must be important though because do you think because they've projected a lot of stuff that haven't been important so far yeah like like they keep just like when they sent all those tweets out with redacted stuff and then it's like ended up not mattering what the tweets actually said pre-reactions per page are there three one two three yeah okay that's interesting so it's even on the first page yeah so that's consistent with the um the number at the top as well because there's three digits hmm so the lives of the page number yeah that's that one like with i'm definitely sure 100 and then how many helicopters are there per screen free free okay i haven't thought about this it says three helicopters okay so right i think i think i've got it so the redaction the redaction is a helicopter yeah well i forgot music playing there we go so on page two what was the number for page two the number from page two what do you mean um sorry one second oh i see the thing for the score so the score for page two was five two one yeah white helicopter is two jumps yeah starts two to the right two to left and three to the right so if we say that a jump a jump left is one word okay oh i see so it could be after the first redaction yeah you get what i'm saying so the first one would be knocking and then we'd oh no so yeah the first one would be knocking and we'd want the fifth letter of knocking that'd be k n o c k okay yeah okay so this is two and then the next one is three wait okay so three left from the next one so one two three would be depressed yeah so that one would be two the second letter would be e the third one from that is direction and the first one of that is d ted okay that could be that could make sense that that probably makes sense so that's page two okay so page one is sh i'll just get up so page one the first one will be two to the right of that is a little and the first one of that is l if this no maybe maybe don't know this looks good this looks good free to the left of the next one is u and that would be the second one is o locked it's going to be locked isn't it locked is is it actually locked like as in do you know the next one two to the left is c and it's one it is it's locked you've got it you've done it so the first one is locked right we can do this now the third one is you're a genius um i've got the clearer version of that so the third one is page free page free there we go um so two three to the left of the first one is bottom and it's a fourth letter which is t yeah and then the next one is two to the right of the next one is can and the second word is a and then two to the right of the third one is remaining and that's nine which makes sense because there's a lot of letters in it one two three four five six seven eight nine it's g locked locked tag okay uh the fourth one there's four there six two six so three to the left of the first one is chopper yeah six one two three four five six e yeah yeah i can't spell e that's embarrassing um the next one is two to the left which is out and there's two which is you so it's locked sorry i need to go back on your screen i'm just typing this out at the same time locked tag eu i don't know if i've done that one right because this is coming out a bit weird the last one is two to the right this is page four commandos and it's six c o and one two three four n locked and loaded people are saying in the chat what's that work i don't know i'll try it now locked and loaded nope that's incorrect all right so but that one says locked tag ian well i'll keep on going anyway just because it makes sense to keep on trying them five is if you got did you post yeah the fifth one down there what was the number for that three seven four oh that's gonna actually matter now whatever what that one is um so page five preview to the right of that is bob which is b and then the next one is two to the right of that one which is position what was the number uh seven one two three four five six seven oh and then the last one is two to the left doing these all make sense like the way you're doing it definitely makes sense what do you say that last one was four one two three four n yeah it's gone a bit off the rails though hasn't it uh the first bit worked so well it makes all right this is this one so six is two to the right and it's three three one you but normally this sort of stuff we can work out the last bit um it's three to the left one two three posted three s locked on top of us bonus something and then two to the left of the last one is system and it was one so it's s bonus that doesn't look like it's going to be right lock tag no no no mike what have i done wrong come on chat what have i done wrong unlocked bonus notes that's definitely the first like the first one is on there is eon is it is that a different language or oh tag it's like you know like there's a um locked tag there's a zombies map called tag uh tag to untoten was the thing and it's not i mean it locked tagged and tooten i'll just type tag down tactile untitans tactus hooton yeah but the last bit is too far from that tag just trying it just in case oh no um oh this looks so close so the sixth one let me just try that again so sick page six three three so it's two to the right of that the third letter is definitely you three to the left of that one is definitely s and then two to left this one is definitely one so that is uss is there a way to like rearrange these so we've got e-u-n uss bonus stage unlocked bonus stage unlocked is that it yep bonus stage unlocked explore zork now to secure the keys return uh 12 pm tomorrow to unlock the next step there we go tweet it out return to the great underground empire and say the incantation take another look at your surroundings some things will be different from what you remember yep oh man if you guys could go tweet that out i'd appreciate it people um retweet that that would be awesome um yeah so we've gotta come back at same time tomorrow then it looks like i mean it says explore zork so so like i don't know if there's something we can do now to explore zork i'm not sure but i didn't see skeletal i did not see there was a lot of people chatting i saw this happening so what did i just do with that page i put on here here so explore zork now to secure the keys so we've just got to go to zork and say incantation okay that's easy thank you for the subscription uh which one is it it's a code cave isn't it yeah yeah type auto joint i think i've got a save at the end of it hopefully hopefully my cache hasn't been on oh what happens auto gyro you utter the word autogyro and the world seems to suddenly shift you get the feeling that new possibilities have become available to you this is the same thing as what happened when we typed um reconnector that's the same like i wonder if it'll be updated then take another look at your surroundings what was the incantation again or the incantation is auto gyro or one word the world seems to yeah that's the same uh phrasing isn't it i'm just trying to work out what's new but it says it says look at your surroundings yeah it does say return to the underground though there's a section of the game that's underground isn't there yeah yeah or in most of the underground here so whenever i go down uh oh up let's go up again take round turn i actually need the mountain i reckon if you say that when you're under the ground something new will happen okay down look it did say that with the kunoito as well and you didn't need to okay um but it could just be like we need to look in a certain place or something like that i'll just say it again under autogyro yeah it doesn't change anything nothing new happens we'll have to go somewhere and look i might see if um if you go back to where this stone barrow is no nothing's different to the stone barrow either yeah i think there's been circled rooms fire and air where are people getting these links from fire and air pawntakespawn.com forward slash fire and air that's where we just were what do you mean that's where we just were oh that's not great yeah that's the same url as um when you put the code in and you've got the bonus oh i see that's the one it takes you to yeah okay oh i see it it does have places circled it's got places on the map circled in the background yeah so we need to go to there that's the same place no it's not no it's not have you got the format uh yeah i should do i'll just look it up again uh this is the one i was using you do you think this is related to zombies do you think that's the angle i i personally don't no i don't think so necessarily okay oh so this is in the kitchen that's super easy to get to one of those in the kitchen so look in the kitchen you're in the kitchen a dark staircase can be seen lining upwards that just goes to the attic the dark chimney leads down and to the east there's a small window it's open the soot covered half has been built on south wall it looks like you can go inside that's new isn't it yeah oh i've got a picture of the hearth as well on my uh on my terminal half the size of this brick half a cake trivash there are five empty holes in one of the walls where it looks like several bricks are falling out wasn't there bricks yeah no it's got a picture of a brick although the holes is a plaque engraved with a few lines of writing we need plaque yeah have you got those pictures so i haven't got the pictures no i can share them with you oh i bet the other room's the bat room isn't it yeah the size of this brick hearth are caked with ash that's what my picture says no the other one is um damp cave that's the other place we need to go to it's damp uh i don't think we've got a picture of a dump cave that's weird uh i'll dm you this sunday people are just posting why are people posting sacred beetle we found out ages ago so that's my picture and then yeah that's the half yeah so the planet's dirty and weathered with few lines of text etched into its surface near dome and round there stands a spire enchanted words produce bright fire nose has got a cross or a plus sign and a wind symbol on his bricks was there an incantation that is related to that because i didn't play through the whole game no no all the incantations were like um modern day words like info hacks and stuff they were all like cold war phrases right right so the clue in this bit is um near doman rounder stands a spire enchanted words produced by spy that's fine that's the engravings room because it's between the round room and the dome room so that's where we have to go and read the incantations i imagine if we go to the damp cave we'll probably find the other um we'll probably find the clue i'm assuming so yeah the other place on the map yeah oh this one lost it that's what i want there we go so i need to get back to there um i'll just take a screenshot of this so i've got it uh instruction there that's the half plaque pump the great bellows yeah dalek had a picture of a bellow as well yeah i bet that's gonna be another damn cave isn't it um i imagine so it'll be a tour that you pick up in the game several bricks fauna oh each brick look at bricks there are seven bricks each with a different symbol engraved onto it a star an eye a square a triangle a circle a plus and a wave they look roughly the same as the missing books in half what's the bet we've got to put them in order well on the picture there's a wave you can clearly see the wave and the plus yeah yeah i can see that yeah so i don't know if you can those are those bricks all right i need to get down here without dying oh i can just take the torch what am i doing take the torch is it gonna let me take a torch sometimes pawn takes pawn just dies horrifically um i imagine lots of people have suddenly hopped onto it but so we need to take the torch to the damn room go to the damp room oh i think pawn takes pawn just crashed i mean it's awkward that's frustrating [Laughter] it's been hard isn't it it really yeah yeah well i suppose that whatever passwords come from this we can't actually use them until 12 pm edt tomorrow i i don't think so i can't even put anything in there in that box you can't yeah oh okay i was thinking maybe it's oh yeah you can't stop in i was thinking it's going to be something where um that you know it gives us a skin and war zone again like the trucks king because the suv skin is like you can see it in game but we can't get it solve the riddle of air and pump the great bellows harness the power of fire and use the mystic order so i'm guessing the mystic order is going to be the brick puzzle and then the riddle of air is going to be the bellows one oh so fire is the half oh is it sorry i'm being stupid i'm being slow so yeah the fire is the half what could we use to find the order or what could the mystic order be i need to go to the other place and look at it anyway and i can't do anything while this is horrifically broken yeah geeky i've got to go buddy but uh thank you for your uh your help with this well thank you for your help you so you worked out to do that last bit that was awesome um yeah i think i might be um i might be on the same time tomorrow we'll see oh cool man yeah and uh yeah i'll are you gonna be streaming for a bit longer yeah yeah yeah i'll send some people over to stream then hopefully i can thank you i'll be awesome cheers man all right catch you later have a good night see you okay bye cool so that's geeky he's uh he's very smart um but i've got to leave it there for today guys we didn't get a trailer or anything today but i do really believe that this has got something to do to do with zombies the fact that they've got six content creators involved with this and they've sent people pcs from the 1980s and they sent us like a camera and all this code stuff if it's just something that you unlock in warzone and modern warfare uh i don't think it's gonna be worth it but honestly i think the fact they've got noah and they've got dalek and sean i think they all do a lot of zombie stuff so i really believe that this is something to do with zombies and over the course of the next couple days we're just gonna unlock more and more and it might it might lead to some kind of trailer or announcement or something but it's fun it's really fun to be involved with this stuff and i hope you guys enjoyed watching it it's a bit different for my channel i know we didn't really play any games today apart from trying to work this stuff out but i really enjoy this and i hope you guys like watching it too that's good fun um one thing that i wanted to do as well i've been sent a load of screenshots from people who've used my uh creator code icon on card on the cod store so i'm just going to bring those up just to say thank you to everyone because uh you know i just i really appreciate that if you use my code on the cod store jack frags in all capital letters i get a bit of kickback from that so it's uh it's just really nice and every time that people do it they tweet me a picture or i ask them to tweet me a picture anyway so we're just gonna go through those now just to wrap up the stream here you bear with me one second i need to actually find those images so we've got them here so just a massive thanks to all these dudes who've uh used my code david heart bent gaming alois mimra peter lomberg aussie yank ashley gibbs thank you ashley honest gabe dabrewski 77 thank you angry appreciate that nile alawi thank you sophia it's very

the same time as i started today with that said thank you for watching guys and if you want to watch someone who is continuing to solve this i think they've just gone into the choose your own
