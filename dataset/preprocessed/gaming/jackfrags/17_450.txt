the growl is back in the current meta of war zone where there's so many good options the growl for me is starting to push its way back into my list of favorites check out this team fight here in the woods we've got two members down camera's pretty low hp i push a forget flank with the mp7 get the down get the finish there's a guy down in front of me finish him off and then there's a third guy peeped in behind the shield line up the growl and just beam to the head that is the perfect distance for the growl take the shielder's cover and get the team wipe that kind of range when you have that three-time scope on the ground it can be so effective in a situation like that so i've been playing with the graver game last couple days because i just haven't touched it in ages because it was nerfed a bit in the past and then we had the kilo meter the doof doof and then of course the amax and then more recently the hellscape that was the dmr and the map 10. but since they've been nerfed i think the ground is a good option again there are times when you're shooting at longer ranges it can feel like a bit of a peashooter and you can run out of ammo really easily but if you're in that medium or even short to medium range you just line up your target hold down fire control the recoil a bit and you will drop enemies easily those 60 bullets as well they just keep on going and i've been putting out a fair amount of damage and kills with this last couple of play sessions that we've had and what you're seeing here is quads been a growl gameplan the only thing you might change is take that scope off but i'm using it with an mp7 so i want a bit more range so that's what i've gone for the three time scope it is still an exceptional weapon and now the dmr's gone we might see more people falling back to this but with that said this is a monster of a game with westie broker machine and study we played this earlier today and there's multiple kills and squad wipes throughout the game and the end gets quite spicy indeed i had to try and solo a couple squads so concentrate on movement firing falling back when i need to it was good fun as always thank you to everyone using my cod supporter creator code in the store if you buy something use my code tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a vid like this one so let's get into the game now if you like the video guys leave a like
