after what seems like an eternity hazard zone has finally been revealed this is one of the three available experiences in battlefield 2042 at launch of the game and today i'm going to be breaking the game mode apart and telling you exactly what it's all about and based on the previous information we were given it does in fact share a lot of similarities with hunt showdown and escape from tarkov and it is not a battle royale so when you play hazard zone you will be inserted as a four-member squad and your main objective is to locate and retrieve critical data drives which are scattered throughout the map and you'll do this while fighting opposing squads made up of real players who've got the same objectives but there's also an ai element here too now if you get one of those data drives you can then choose when to extract before a storm turns the area into a no-fly zone in terms of the player count in this game mode it will be 24 on all gen consoles and 32 players per round on next gen and pc now specialists in hazard zone are restricted and that means that your squad cannot contain more than one of the same specialist that means that making the right choices here may give you the edge during various phases of the match tornadoes as i mentioned they're here too and apparently they're a rare occurrence but they could strike during a round so watch out for them because if you die in this game mode you could lose a lot of progress so you can be down here just like in your typical vr game and when you're in that down state you can then crawl to safety and attempt to be revived by a teammate if you're killed in this state you're gonna be put in the spectator screen you'll have to watch however there is an opportunity for you to get back in the game if your squad use a reinforcement uplink and they're scattered across the map or they can be brought in as a tactical upgrade and we'll talk about those in a couple minutes the maps available at launch will be on the seven all-out warfare maps so to start with it doesn't look like there's custom maps for this game mode rather they've picked certain areas of the massive all-out warfare maps section them off and that will be the hazard zone portion who's to say that they couldn't do multiple portions of the same level though so this is a bit of a tense squad focused survival game and i think dice set out to make something with a bit more tension and narrative with this game mode something that feels like there's some stakes on the line so why why would you want to play this game mode would i say that this mode combines tense squad focused survival experience gameplay with the battlefield sandbox in the trailer we saw you've got gun play you've got verticality and you've got vehicles and as i said you'll fight real people other squads but the tornado can come in as well as deadly occupying forces attempting to protect the data drives and these are ai they're artificial intelligence and i assume with this being a different game though the ai might be souped up a bit more dangerous maybe we'll have like special ai or something i think that'll be cool and dice said that your objective in this game mode is not really to kill but to extract out of the map out of the hazard zone with as many of those data drives as possible and throughout the duration of a match there are two limited time extraction opportunities and they will occur at different times and at different locations this means that only two squads in total can make out alive from the round or potentially none at all choosing the right mix in your squad super important dice did give a few examples of this so you could have an offensive squad with mckay and falc and then you've got a more defensive squad build something like irish and boris irish he's got that fortification system that armor and boris of course can set up a turret help lock down a certain area of the map let's say an extraction or when you're collecting one of those drives or you've got the collector's build if you want to be a bit greedy and just get as many data drives as you can pick something like casper and falc recon areas keep yourself topped up with health so why should you care about this why would you play this game mode over all that warfare or something in portal do i say the answer to that is the metagame so there's another layer to this rather than just the in-game portion so let's say you went into a round with a squad and you extract a couple of data drives well those data drives are assigned value and each one of those that you extract can then be converted into a hazard zone specific currency called dark market credits and you can then spend those dark market credits before you enter a match in order to buy and equip weapons gadgets and tactical upgrades unique to hazard zone so essentially you spend that money and you upgrade your loadout before the next match and if you continue to win matches you'll start to build up your extraction streak and this is a level attached to each unique specialist that you play as that increases by plus one on successful rounds and resets to zero on failed rounds acquiring a high extraction streak unlocks discounts when purchasing tactical upgrades or items for your loadout so i suppose that's the hook right you go in you extract your street goes by one that means you can buy more powerful gear you go in you win again your street goes up again but if you die that streak disappears and you won't have any of those loadout or tactical upgrade advantages anymore your specialist and your loadout is essentially what you're holding on to and if you die you'll lose that and have to start again so it's kind of like a very basic version of hunt showdown i suppose so what are these tactical upgrades that you can get then at launch well to begin with there are a couple of free ones the starting armor which gives you plus 20 armor and then a negotiated bounty which gives you 50 additional credits for kills on occupying forces ai other things that you can buy through the dark market credits are included here so you can get a squad reinforcement and that's just a respawn for your teammates you can get quickdraw holster so you switch weapons 15 faster and there's all sorts of different ones on here which as you would expect are perks for your character that will improve everything that you do in game and give you certain bonuses and then finally dice gave us a little overview of what a match would look like to start with you strategize and equip so prior to the match get with your squad put together a loadout confirm where you want to spawn on the level and here you can choose your specialist you can spend your credits on weapon and equipment loadouts and tactical upgrades you'll then insert into the level like in the trailer there'll be a bit of a cutscene and then when you in the match it's time to retrieve and start searching for those data drives and then if a member of your squad has chosen the intel scanner that's a unique hazard zone gadget that can help you reveal the approximate locations of these pre-crashed satellites and then talk to your team about where they are data drives can be scanned no matter where they are or who is carrying them so i think that means that if a squad already has got some data drives you can use that scanner and find out where that squad is to ambush them try to steal them and while you're doing that initial sweep the occupying forces will attempt to fight you other squads will attempt to fight you and then mid game new satellites will fall from the sky and those contain several data drives making them more valuable than the ones that were already pre-crashed so that will create a moment of excitement in the match i suppose and draw some of the squads together as you fight for those crashed satellites it will get competitive so let's say you've got some data drives now how do you get out with your life well there is a first extraction this is the first window to leave the game a few minutes after the start of the match a randomized location will be chosen as an extraction zone and if you choose to extract then you'll have another few minutes to successfully arrive at that zone in time fight other squads ai to board the condor get out of there but if you stay in the level there is a second last extraction and that's 10 to 12 minutes after the start of the match so these rounds are quite short really and any remaining squads in that game we'll have to battle over the final extraction zone because if you don't make it on board you're left behind you're going to lose everything that you've gathered and you're going to lose that streak but even if just one of your squad gets out with something you'll all get rewarded for it and there it is i'd love to play it check it out and see what it actually plays like it's definitely going to scratch that competitive itch for a lot of players who like that element of battlefield bit more tension bit more tactics maybe it's just you and your squad so there'll definitely be some fun gameplay opportunities here the metagame though based on these descriptions sounds really basic and i think that's where this might fall down and people might lose interest i'd love to see some design mechanics that make them care about the game mode the character a bit more maybe you know like in tarkov you've got your bass and you can upgrade it by extracting certain things from the level perhaps they could do that here with an aircraft carrier where you've got to upgrade that and that can give your specialist on a streak additional perks perhaps instill more of a punishment when you die also this could already be a thing in hazard zone but if it isn't then to give people incentive to play the game and care more about their character they could have stuff like if you get to a 10 extraction streak you unlock a unique cosmetic that you can only get that way and then you can take that into all that warfare and portal and show hey this is how much of a badass i am on hazard zone only a few weeks now until we can try it anyway so well know then i'll be checking out hazard zone but let me know your thoughts down in the comments below what do you guys think about this if you enjoyed the
