hi everyone hope you're doing well today I've got an absolutely mad game of war zone with the two angry gamers I don't know what it is but when I play with those guys we just get all sorts of shenanigans but I also wanted to show you this and talk about it because I think this is quite important Infinity Ward today I've actually posted an update about how they're dealing with cheaters in the game obviously cheating in warzone is a big problem at the moment I did that video a couple days ago where we had a chat about it and I offered up some more things that they could be doing because it really feels like they're not doing enough but today they posted this so starting this week players in warzone and modern warfare who report suspected cheaters will receive confirmation in-game when a player is banned I think that's a good thing because if it just happened to you you see an obvious cheater you report them and you come back and get a notification saying they've been banned it feels like something is actually working and you've made an impact there as well as that they're deploying additional dedicated security updates I assume that means just a more robust antiquey or an update to whatever anti cheat systems they're using increased resources but the next one is frankly hilarious updated matchmaking too much suspected cheaters together so I suppose if they suspect you're a cheat and they haven't banned your account yet you will just be put in a lobby full of other cheaters so you'll just have 150 cheaters playing against each other and then I suppose they'll know how it feels but I'd rather they just banned them to be honest they've also got an increased resource across back-end tech studio and enforcement teams so they're putting more weight behind the anti cheats and coming soon I think this is a big one reports the player functionality to the killcam and spectator modes so instead of having to exit the game go to your recent matches and recently matched with players and then finding that player and then reporting them it looks like you'll be able to do it in the future just from the kill camp and the spectator which will definitely be a massive improvement on how it is right now so with that said that's good news I think for everyone who is enjoying the game we'd like to keep it as cheap free as possible of course I just wanted to keep you guys up to speed with that with that said I'm gonna get into the match that we played earlier now some good moments in here if you liked it leave a like and subscribe if you want to see more
