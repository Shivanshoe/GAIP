watch this start the round clock this guy from a mile away the jet coming in boom why is that allowed why can you even do that everyone just stood around there like what's going on but welcome back guys to some bf 2042. this was a pretty interesting round on renewal i thought i'd post this today because it's been an exciting day in the games industry and also we still haven't had an update on the future for bf2042 and i said in my last live stream or last video on the game which i think was about nine days ago that i thought it was going to be last week i thought with that being like what the first or second week back after the holiday christmas break the we'd actually get some form of communication but we haven't had anything yet so it's got to be coming soon i think a lot of the players in the community are looking for some kind of direction with the game we don't know anything about the live service updates roadmap blog whatever's next so as a battlefield fan it feels like we're in the dark a bit with this one but we'll have to wait and see i'm using the ac 42 in this one maria falca i was trying to figure out what she was looking at as i eat an anti-armor grenade into space because i think that's where they all go because every time i throw one it disappears into the stratosphere and it's a damn good job the battlefield 2042 isn't real life because if it was a thousand years into the future they'll try and take off a rocket into space when the world's about to end they're going to relocate all the humans to mars and everyone will be there sat in their rocket ships and they'll take off and they'll just find a load of anti-armor grenades up there in orbit and that'll be the end of us it's trying to do a c4 jeep here from what i recall and i watched the video back and i don't understand how there's not a kill here watch there's an enemy player right there let go explode nothing go around the corner dead did i not get that kill the teammate on the quad with me there died as well i think unfortunate for some but bad timing for me because my entire team is already here now there was some massive and i mean massive gaming news today when i read it i literally said out loud there's no way i just i didn't have it on my bingo card in 2022. you know that's how i felt but do you remember last year 2021 i think it was the second week of march xbox on microsoft announced that they had acquired or bought paid for bethesda the game's publisher so that meant the xbox now had control of a ton of popular gaming ips like fallout dishonored doom prey skyrim rage the elder scrolls there's a lot of big titles there isn't there now for that acquisition they reportedly paid 7.5 billion us dollars that's a lot of money but today a few hours ago in fact xbox and microsoft announced that they have plans to acquire activision blizzard and the price it's about 70 billion us dollars this is crazy news absolutely crazy i just never thought something like that would happen i assumed that activision blizzard would be too big for that i was wrong and this has got some huge implications for the industry as a gamer it throws up a lot of questions because activision blizzard have development studios and intellectual property rights to games like call of duty to games like world of warcraft diablo overwatch starcraft and how can we forget about candy crush i've never played it but apparently it's one of the most popular mobile games in the world there has ever been so there's that 70 billion that's an absolutely staggering amount of money isn't it now we're gonna get back to that in just a second because there's a lot to unpack there but what is this one two three boris turrets there's an irish shield what's going on here there's a ranger outside pretending to be a t2000 guy runs down the stairs take him out with a quick kill and i've got the flank on here i'm feeling good about this didn't quite get the last but it's not over yet because chili con canny squad mate rezzes me i stand up kill the guy that got him and i'm going to return that favor right there angel does it again he's back in the game [Music] guy in the corner and i've got a nice little flank on here good clip that was i enjoyed that trapped in the corner can i get the nade off i can is it enough for a kill yes sir it is double kill there apparently and then they decided to just set me on fire so that's the end of that now when i heard about the microsoft acquisition of activision blizzard because of the space that i'm in and what games i play what i'm kind of into my immediate thought was well what does this mean for call of duty we've got cod mobile we've got cod warzone and every year like clockwork there is a new main call of duty title that might change under the microsoft leadership but does this also mean the call of duty in the future might not be available on playstation and this is an incredibly interesting topic because i think it's 50 50. now as far as i know the largest player base for call of duty is on playstation that's the biggest percentage so if xbox turn around june july this year let's say they do a showcase and they go oh by the way guys if you want to play this year's call of duty rumored to be modern warfare 2 you got to get an xbox or a pc because they've spent crazy money on this so what's to stop them making big sweeping decisions like that they want to get some bang for their buck don't they i mean xbox have already announced that some bethesda games starlink for example they're going to be exclusive to pc and xbox so why not call of duty it's one of the biggest ips in the world at the same time though they're going to lose a lot of their revenue if they do that especially in the short term because my understanding is that if a publisher makes a game so let's say xbox publish develop the new call of duty and it's sold on the playstation then they'll get a percentage of every copy of the game sold so immediately microsoft are going to lose out on a load of easy money because people buy cod every year it's almost guaranteed to sell 20 million a year just because it's cod so in the short term they'd be losing out doing that they definitely annoyed the biggest portion of their player base too i don't think they're gonna do that especially for the next few years i think xbox will allow it to remain on playstation consoles but long term maybe in the end call of duty becomes an xbox exclusive or maybe it's on playstation and xbox but you can get it on game pass on day one but what do you guys think is going to happen with cod let me know down in the comments below i'm just making assumptions here of course and do you think sony will respond to this do you think sony is going to buy a publisher who would they buy and those other games as well that xbox has just acquired overwatch definitely dropped off but if they actually come back and make a decent sequel could be a big hit diablo massive world of warcraft massive subscription based starcraft is a really strong ip the more i think about it the more that i come to the conclusion it's about live service and it's about game pass and it's about mtx because all those games even call of duty of course nowadays especially warzone and cod mobile it's all about live service and trying to give people a reason to log in again what's new what's the new event what's the new skin how do i unlock this thing here's a new map or game mode you can try all those games that i just listed they all fit into that bracket in my opinion so i think it is a very strong move from a business perspective by xbox and they've obviously got screw you money if they can spend 70 billion but i do feel like it might be the last big publisher acquisition for a while but get this there's also rumors that this news won't be the biggest gaming news this week i've seen rumors on twitter could be completely unfounded and made up but the rumor is that sony and nintendo are going to merge a game could be complete nonsense but some say there's no smoke without fire we'll have to say about that one well that is all for today guys i hope you enjoyed the gameplay in the background there fingers crossed we actually get an update on 2042 this week and as i mentioned the xbox thing crazy let me know your thoughts below if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
