this kilo 141 build is absolutely dominating in season six of warzone i can't stop using it and it's funny how when warzone came out no one gave this gun a look at all but now it's arguably the best in the game competing with the m4 the growl and the gallow and today i'll be using this build along with the new fixed spr playing with aculite and euros i've got four matches for you today and we ran into some really challenging components and interesting situations so i've made this video longer than usual let me know if you like that down below or not but i really think that these matches are entertaining and you guys will love them as always a big thanks to everyone using my supporter creator code in the cod store jack frags in all caps if you use it and buy something from the store tweet me a pic and i'll put it in a video like this one with that said if you enjoyed the video hit that like button right now subscribe for more and let me know your thoughts on these matches in the comments so let's jump in see if we can hear some rage and more importantly get some wins you want to go for these oh yeah down nice shot nice shot quick work of them didn't you they just both let out a deep sigh have you seen one or two there i always seen one guy there oh up here down [Laughter] i feel evil i don't even know what you get from doing this intelligence yeah oh i haven't done one yet either everyone's got ghosts or no one's on this side of the map uh behind a pillow fire broke okay sorry dad nice cover i'm not seeing anybody else oh yeah i feel like you would have shot at me by now right there okay i'll have to work uphill yeah i don't have an angle i'm okay i'm in cover now he hit me a bit that could be his friend maybe see if i can head glitch this oh you got him what he just pushed you out in the open like that yeah he had no idea you were there either i guess he could have a friend in the tunnel uh the train's coming so maybe i'm gonna go see what this guy had up though how do you feel about c4s now have you tried using them nope i haven't used them just enough i just feel like they really don't go far enough i think if they reduced the speed of the throw like the actual velocity of it but it could go like the same distance i would be okay with it i can only check them about two feet now guy here on a quad bike that's just two there yeah you're gonna chase them probably go to the roof i bet yeah we can do that i bet they're going on the roof oh that's from behind oh [Music] did you hop out they're right behind you yeah okay i'm gonna risk oh this guy right here [Music] i'm in trouble can you come up or no i'll try one jumped down oh you're insane that was a team light they're still underneath underneath two boats down finish finish well done jack what's what [Music] holy there's another guy right below yeah dead you're just slaying holy god at least west as well there's a gas mask here if you need i've got one thank you is there a couple spare plates there oh yeah you should be able to find something oh i'm stunned where'd that come from you got this out the door maybe yeah there's a guy in there to the left we could push him if you want down low yeah alston ready he went further he went further oh okay hold on attack rubber was behind us yeah he's like way over there now okay so if we go to the roof there was a guy in the tower trying to snipe me i mean if we down him i could air strike him can you get the angle on that is that possible i think so yeah you need a bit of luck but i'm feeling lucky let's have a go he also got a vehicle behind us oh comes down where was i being shot from then probably tower yeah it's a tower guy down and killed off one again thank you come on tower guy [Applause] or something you want to get off this one yeah i kind of want to jump it i guess tower guy speaking again i got shot from southwest those guys on the bridge to your left he's popping no not right now but they were close at least one guy right there yeah he was around there underneath us now i think oh yeah i think he's underneath yeah i can hear him looking here yeah he's right underneath me relocating unless there's another one on your side as well yeah he wanted anything again uh we screwed here um maybe we could take a vehicle and just drive off the edge if you want to go to the bridge yeah we could just drive it away okay i think this is good yep pretty try to cool a little bit more zone when you fire that peak am it doesn't have directional audio for me so i get really confused yeah because i'm like where's that coming bro oh there's gonna be guys here yeah attack rubber yeah how about i got two stuns yeah i can hear him i can hear him claymore john i saved these stunts so should we get uh we could try it once done i downed one all right okay go [Applause] there's like way way there's like eight climbers up there both down i killed i think i killed either one off up there there's eight cleaners connor you said i swear i saw three at least okay hey you got anything in the heartbeat yep uh northeast though yeah it's still there you see that i got one of them there's another one there's another one okay this is the three-man team why are they still there very strange yeah we got two in northeast building we still got two over there keep that in mind down one should we push i think we should guy in garage garage right side he was broken finish yourself yep oh it's a different team yeah what so we've got guys just pulled up behind us he's shooting at me two of them okay these guys are going to lock us down kind of you want to get a car and go left do you think we can yeah real time well maybe i don't know still behind us oh yeah i seen them they were crossing over to the garages let's just run left low ground yeah yeah stay low got a big bridge as well here that team behind us though still at the house watch out i think i heard this guy here up here south i guess [Music] maybe there's a guy to a right on the road i've got to get this gas down location oh he's got a sniper to the right uh underneath the bridge i'm safe but he did get me i got the kill on the one this is tracker three one good copy i think he killed i put an stock on case thank you i heard shots 330 north someone's up to the hill here there's only two of the teams left man reloading this thing is a nightmare oh right there right there on the hill i've got on my bro come on bro found them you're good you're good you want to push now yep i broke the other one or he didn't have armor or something he's going to rest where's the other guy no idea i'd guess on that right do you want to push up straight on them oh he's up the hill down the one at the far side of the hill reloading i think we're good here yeah we're safe we're safe oh other side left side of the bridge [Music] i don't think he can get back up there hopefully no one comes behind me 1v2 v1 you just rest if these guys push me together i'm kind of screwed yeah but they won't because they're they have the guy uphill where's the other guy up hill do you think he's like okay he was northwest he was like way up here edges on yellow okay okay i'm so behind it's pushing you there you go that's what you want you also have an armor box he killed them both 1v1 yeah he can't get behind me unless he goes all the way through the gas i really hope the zone comes to you i think i'm gonna get unlucky i'd just say play gas but he could work his way around behind you and then to your left yeah i'm gonna guess that he thinks i'm already past hopefully he's right above you he's waiting damn it damn nice try he played that really well he's got the glitch gun as well for me so yeah you had it for me as well i couldn't see anything yeah well i broke him and he killed me first that was a fun game man i enjoyed that not bad you're mowing people down towards that end game there yeah that's good team after team there you go there's the broken weapon bdsm rosie is it gonna be like ruined in this yeah it's broken in this as well that's cool you know they fix one thing another thing breaks i think someone's in my building or the one next to it yeah there's two in the building next to me i want to land on the roof but i don't know if there's a team up the hill i've got one down one's in my building coming for me he's our ground floor he's gonna come up i think i'm gonna play i'm watching it i can't use my plates they're bugged he's ground floor broken coming up oh no he backed off quite fast can you leave the building i'm on the outside front side of it okay i see him on heartbeat if you haven't heard him play yeah then he's really low catch you up sit tight thank you batman no problem batman i think he had some plays there's a gp connor beam it got the other guy i just got glitched in the matrix there for a moment that was kind of strange you would i like that that's good yeah i was just i was like inside the box or something just standing still you take the red pill oh i mean look at that behind us two teams at a hangar what are they dude are they there on the outside yeah let's snipe them they're gonna have to move yeah i was thinking we just go to these pillars one's dead one down two dead well did it yeah i think so they must have killed the other team yeah they did they did

don't know if he's still in here uh okay i'm landing back i got no hits yeah he's on the other side of the wall here over here how did he beat me on that you could probably two shot him pistol maybe
