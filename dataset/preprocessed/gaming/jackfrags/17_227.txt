hi everyone and welcome to the battlefield 2042 open beta so i've already released a video on this earlier today it's about 25 minutes of gameplay but no commentary or anything like that and i wanted to do a live stream jumping again we'll play for about three to four hours and just see what it's like now it's the evening uk time should be a ton of people on already i'm really looking forward to it i thank you for coming along tonight if you're watching this live see you guys in the chat if you're watching this as a vod welcome big thanks to epic games as well for sponsoring this one and if you do pick anything up on the epic game store do consider using my code jack frags as a creator code that will just give me a bit of kickback from that purchase and it's a great way to help support me so then if you guys haven't played the open beta yet or seen any gameplay of it it's pretty bare bones at the moment there's a few options that you can change of course you've got all the usual customization there i don't think everything's there though and there's definitely a few features in the game that's missing from the beta a dice have said that this build of the game is a couple months old there are bugs it's a bit janky in places and there are some features missing but with that said we're going to get into it now see if we can find a game just one map for the beta conquest 128 players what's up alex how you doing hey dank's delightful gaming great name hey knows all thank you gaming for life thank you for the two uh chinto thank you for becoming a member i'm sure many of you guys have already played this today i played it for about three hours on monday we had a capture event and that was what you saw in the video earlier today and that is the same build of the game as this as well so there's a lot of stuff that i just haven't tried and it's going to be a pretty chill stream to be honest we're going to do a bit of experimentation a bit of messing around have some fun right so there are only four specialists in this build of the game when the game launches there's supposed to be ten so we've got mckay boris casper and falc most sectors are now i had the most fun playing with mckay so far i've not really tried boris at all not really played as casper did a little bit as foul she's got this self-heal she can heal people from a distance but yeah i feel like mckay was just the most fun to be honest so we're gonna go with that and i am gonna pick a rocket launcher as my universal gadget and we'll just go with the m5a3 which is the the base assault rifle to start with we've got i think there's two smgs in total two assault rifles one lmg one dmr one sniper and one shotgun so here we go so i'm playing on a mix of medium and high graphics performance isn't great i'd like to you know get more fps to be honest considering the ring that i have but i'm sure the optimizations will come down the line what should i put on my gun then i definitely want a bigger sight that's a hybrid extended barrel factory barrel i don't think i've got a suppressor for this one so you can't adjust the loadouts outside the menu at the moment i think that's coming in the main game but you can use this plus system here projectile velocity i'll stick with the standard mag there put a foregrip on let's go with that for now yeah that's a hybrid site as well if you use this site by the way it's bugged at the moment so if you spawn with it you can't switch but if you spawn and take it off and take it back and put it back on again you right click and then press f on pc i presume that's the melee key on console and you can actually switch it like that is dlss available i don't think it's in this build of the game but it's supposed to be there at launch reflex is in though nvidia reflex is on and also there's no map in this build of the game you know how in battlefield games you can press m and bring up the map that isn't in this build but it will be in the the launch build of the game because a lot of people me personally as well i use that too i press m to just get a quick look at the map and see what's going on but that's not in this unfortunately so the only mini map we've got is the one in the bottom left hey cal bone i get about 90 to 100 frames per second if i play on ultra it's about 60 to 70. can you climb the container like in the demo what do you mean by the container i don't know what you mean by that you can get on almost anything with the grapple like any ruse stuff like that straight away can you get an apache yeah you can uh hum law thank you for the time i think that guy's noticed me uh chicken thank you for three months as a member dmr dominates this map daily cliche thank you for the membership so we've got a big rocket over here oh there's another rocket in the distance i didn't even realize that i think this guy wants to be on the stream there you go pogos man the map is huge the size of it i've not properly dialed in my settings either yet like my mouse sends and controls so you know i'm not feeling 100 with everything but we'll give it our best shot there's a guy parachute in there a couple of helicopters up here oh that's an ai flying that can i hit that i did but it looks like it's two shots to take it down try it again go on i just went through the rotor blades i think is the game volume okay now by the way is it loud enough i just turned it up a bit and lags a bit as well when you zoom in i feel like that's a proper 3d rendered scope bit stuttering when you zoom in uh you can do a tactical sprint as well you know like in modern warfare they introduced that so you've got your normal sprint speed then you press shift again or sprint and you can run like that you can't mount though which is a shame i'd love to be able to mount uh tyler thank you for the 20. i'm gonna go around the back here are they trying to that sounds so basic [Music] i don't know what the hit markers mean as well there's different hit markers as you can have armor in this game and it is just a straight health upgrade which i think is is kind of weird there's quite a lot of recall on the gun from that distance as well there's a car there not anymore mount with bipods maybe that's a feature i don't know i need some ammo poker so have you got ammo i don't think pogo's just got ammo uh toledo thank you for becoming a member i'll try and get to the top of the building there people can put there like crazy a grapple hook kills possible yes they are just in i've seen a couple clips today already i've not done it yet what is that is that the rocket from over there what the hell audio is weird [ __ ] ways to go move it got a ways to go can i call in my own time armored vehicle on my position copy that vehicle is on its way sky parachute just want to see if i can take out that other tank so the turrets are kind of delayed as well they remind me of world of tanks you guys ever play world of tanks i go after this tank here you can't turn them like you could in the old games bear thrills i think there's a guy behind that yeah he's dead so if you look at the names by the way if it says like private and then a real name get rokil here that's an ai and it usually says ai after that as well like in brackets but if you see a name like those last couple kills that's a real player i think this is a real player here yeah it's a specialist skin but there's an enemy over here i don't know why anyone's like no one's shooting at this guy got him do you think it's a 30 series issue i've got 2080 ti and i get 100 plus maybe i know there's some problems with the 39 in certain being that games but you do have um oh he's going up the zip line you do have unlimited ammo on the vehicles in this game there's a little tesla truck there check that out uh this match has 128 players yeah it does there might be a couple of bots if someone's disconnected but yeah it's supposed to have 128 there's people here i moved away ow you want to go again someone's locking onto [Music] we've got me in almost every sector [Music] should regen health as well you don't need to repair the vehicles manually but there is a repair tool i think i don't know if it's in this build of the game that tank is zooming that's a quick it's a quick tank in it quick land oh yeah that guy's got the repair tool look at that who's that someone's shooting at me there [Applause] they're all jumping off oh that was a bad idea wasn't it justin gamer thank you for becoming a member what's up sammy uh we got 400 from aronava as well thank you so much you tried the game earlier got constantly put into high hyping servers and my fps is quite bad i hope there's more optimization and dlss at launch yeah me too i like how this tank sounds like a vacuum cleaner you think it sounds like a vacuum cleaner maybe when i hit the turbo yeah yeah it kind of does it's a bit of a dyson isn't it where are the enemies see this is where i just went to press m to look at my map but it's just not in the game yet oh they're up on the roof here what's up mckay oh my god dude the sound like the sound is so good that tank sounds incredible what if i could get a helicopter or a jet oh sounds so crunchy a henry hoover maybe it is a henry uh ninja thank you and just some gamer thank you for becoming a member the russians have sector charlie yeah you can see you can actually cut your shoot as well like that guy did i think i've been shot at from above there i can't get an angle yeah oh no c5 explosive airplay uh neon cyber thanks for the 20. first impressions on the gun play is there any gun you'd want to see at launch to be honest i don't know many of these guns because they're all like based on modern weapons and i don't really keep up to date with that i mean like the vector's already in the vector is a pretty cool weapon i just don't want them to go too futuristic with their guns you know keep it grounded look at this guy's sniping we try and go up the tower yeah i really don't like the user interface by the way i think like it needs to be a lot smaller i hope you can scale it on launch and also i don't like the glow on everything i think it makes it difficult to read everything's got a glow whatever color it is it glows that color i really don't like it yeah but the gunplay is quite satisfying i like the gunplay a lot and there is actually a bit of recall as well on the weapons especially at distances oh there's a guy there to be fair that guy probably came over because he he saw me shooting at franco thanks for the 20 greetings from argentina what's this what the hell does that do is there an elevator i know there's a repel here isn't that yeah take this up my time to kill is quite good as well i really like it i don't think it's too slow or too fast you know it just feels right i feel like i can react as well at ranges if i'm getting shot at you know i've got a chance to get out of there quick they were just dropping from the roof yeah does that repel i think that repel goes all the way up maybe quick reload i'm gonna switch to my okay so that's the bug there hold on they've gone all the way down yeah they've gone all the way down i'm gonna put a little sight on because i'm gonna go close quarters here don't shoot me are you gonna come after me oh i need help here would you say the guns are as hard to use as bf3 i'd say probably a little bit easier than bf3 on first impression i mean not i've only used like five of them so i don't know like when the full game's out there's probably going to be loads more guns that feel different to each other there's no helicopters available we lose an a by the looks like sector delta he just took delta oh fun thanks for the 20. so there's at least one person here so i had to pull down quite a lot there with my mouse the enemy over here trade kill that sucks i was pretty low hp to be better jet action gabby can i pick a jet i could do yeah but there's none available at the moment i'll try a little bird the helicopter controls are much easier to use i would say than the f4 and three like they're a bit more arcadey and the mouse controls a lot more this time i know there's an enemy that's somewhere gutty we got most of the sectors under control yeah i mean the aiming though like the sensitivity is a bit weird for sure gotta get used to that oh there's a guy there what's he doing and take out this jeep jumped out is it like warzone no it's more difficult than warzone to fly the helicopters at least no you're in there somewhere yeah warzone is very casual accessible helicopter controls this i would say this is kind of in between bf4 and war zone you've also got this camera as well i think that's awesome i love that how that looks look at all these guys here should go to the roof i nearly took a rocket there let's get out there for a sec yeah it's going to take some getting used to it almost feels like there's a bit of input lag on the mouse as well when you use the mouse oh look at this guy we're trying to get a roadkill i know they're gonna hit the ground [Music] is the beta open it's open from the eight i think or the seventh to get it today you need to have either pre-ordered the game or you've got ea play pro i think is it's really difficult to aim good fun though uh jamie thank you for the five how's the audio audio's from like in terms of the sound effects it's really good footstep audio is is really bad like they need to look at that take a pass on it and and do a big improvement on it [Music] what were they saying are you trying to rocket me oh i gave him an opportunity there didn't i uh free mata for the blind thank you for the five have you experienced the camera looking down at your feet when running randomly uh that's a bug with controllers i've heard [Laughter] when you can't kill him with the guns that guy's dead yeah the footstep audio needs a lot of work this attack helicopter i've not seen the tornado yet i haven't played when there's been a tornado like i said i've got about three hours on monday at the capture event but i've never seen the tornado hey dewolf what's up hey dunk what's up elliott hello fluffy how's it going guys i appreciate you being here tonight for the stream hope you enjoyed it so far uh i could go up to the roof again see if i can try to improve my accuracy with these guns this is the the campus camp spot this is over here go online stay at that point you don't get direction as well from where they're locking onto you from which is kind of weird i think it was that right there hey daniel what's up catalystics d-bear how you doing d-bear good to see you again my mate are they all jumping off assist i get some kills with this uh it's a bit more difficult to aim this is oh my god you see how much that swung there it looks so cool though reminds me of um there's a movie where this camera angles in it is it black hole down oh nice shot someone got me good there with a rocket hey benjo what's up i love that camera angle how sick is that how do you know if someone's about their name um you can't even click on the squads to say it'll say like private daniel jackson and then brackets ai hey dustin thanks for the five conor oh thanks for becoming a member and benj as well uh the what size is it it's like 18 or 20 gig the download little bird down hey schlen what's up man how you doing i'd love to try and fight on that point that'd be cool grapple doesn't go all the way up there unfortunately does this go all the way up i got you don't worry mate i got you back russians are low on troops and supplies is the rocket taking off i think it's taking off a few sectors left before the russians have it all i missed it yeah the rocket taking off has no consequence to the gameplay either really i know it's still there i don't think it's going to take off this match i don't think there's enough time let's go up here oh yeah that can freeze you to death as well it's like cryo or something see how my screen is turning all i see is someone waiting up here to kill me let's see i know we've taken it you're friendly cool now we're the roof campers no oh dude i'm trying to call in my vehicles uh velocity kecta what's up man thanks for the five how do we get into jets is anyone gonna res me i don't think so maybe all right if you want to get into a jet just click on the vehicle thing here like that i've not tried this yet so are we gonna crash [Music] the veto mode [Music] oh man get wrecked there were three people in there this is kind of sick though i love this this is full true lies this one fox one fox two goodbye [Music] oh man pony arcade that's a good good first game right there we smashed them 37 kills nice little mix of gameplay uh bench thanks for the five man still remember meeting you in argos dude that was you i pretended it wasn't me as well didn't i i was like no i never heard of him mate i can't believe that binge that's awesome the fact that you remembered that thank you for serving me a frying pan in august it was a frying pan as well you just recognized my voice didn't you game one in the bag what do we think so far guys what do you think true lies was great sick bro it was a nice game why is that floating it's a vtol avion it's got two different flight modes you can fly like a jet or you can turn the engine so you can hover why didn't it launch sometimes it just doesn't it's a chance [Music] about 20 000 viewers oh that's insane uh matt jones thank you super onion thank you crazy crazy i get the attack helicopter i've not tried the osprey yet that one there let's call the condor i think the biggest problem for me right now is uh the ui the footstep audio i think mckay is going to be quite clearly the meta specialist as well just because maneuverability is so op but also you can get armor i've not talked about armor yet i don't really agree with arma being in a battlefield game but i don't think it's going away because it's on a couple of the specialists i've got a gunner as well so let's see if we can make this work did you bail gone again goodbye this is sick i love just flying around in the attack helicopter so much fun [Music] this just reminds me of armor three but it's multiplayer i love doing this alexander thanks for the upgrade buddy i'll say ruin i'm gonna ruin them is that a jet killer are you gonna flare go on flare fly goodbye maybe they didn't have their flare come on you should be racking these up there we go look at that one down here thank you look how the track is the tank is actually deforming the land that's kind of sick other footsteps sounds more or less broken the war zone at the moment more broken like i said they may have you know they may have improved it um they said this is an old build but we'll have to wait and see you know like you've got to point this kind of stuff out is that a tank in the tunnel you see that the destruction looks non-existent so disappointing there isn't much destruction on this map i mean you can like these buildings here you can like blow holes in the side [Music] see like that's about all there is you can make some craters on the ground oh no there's not much i'm looking for armor give me some armor targets something came up then a rocket oh there's some armor i know it's transport i'll go after that think about gonna get him he's gone out there let's move good evening be stone how you doing have i seen the rocket blow up yet yeah i have that's someone calling in a ranger you can blow it up yourself i'll show you how to do it if it gets triggered on this map i'll i'll do it so you guys can see [Music] they bailed out [Music] you know where the locks coming from is it more fun than bf5 for me yeah it's it's it's a lot more sandbox it feels like a traditional battlefield games to me like all those battlefield moments are back you know that's the most important thing for me [Music] who is locking onto me someone is just firing it could be ai i don't know [Music] gonna come on wake up we've got b now which is good that's a vehicle down here i could get i don't know if this is the best map for the beta though i feel like it's it's a big map and it is it's a great mix of uh like land and air armored vehicles infantry you know maybe they should have picked something a bit more infantry focus just for the beta but i don't really feel like this is a beta if it's a two month old build you know and they fix a lot of the issues then what's the point in a way you know i feel like it's just a chance for people to try the game or like maybe find bugs that they haven't found yet i'm gonna go down here i think [Music] flying over their base i think they'll probably get a lot of data though from the servers as well with this and cross play maybe it'll be useful for dice should i play um i'll switch to sniper for a bit how about that see if we can get some snipes on oh yeah the um the guns as well if you're in a vehicle like a tank and you've got a gun the camera is completely busted so it's kind of unusable at the moment this the secondary weapons when you're in a vehicle like the tank or the aaa vehicle for example what the hell was that why you think it's just exploding next to me you haven't said dice please yet i'm sure that's coming don't worry i'll try the other scope stud said this scope's better for the sniper rifles uh what's with the phantom parachutes as well weird mad dog germany i get a little um a robot dog yeah ranger requesting a ranger you can support me let's go dog but this is the rangers uh a dog that you can give orders to the market and it shoots people spots people doesn't do much damage but you know it's good to just have it around and watch your back i suppose come on dog did you just did it just bark what the hell was that noise that's a parrot rain just got me three or four kills so far yeah i don't expect it's gonna do a mad kill streak see i can tell it to like go over there i don't know if it dies though when you die i don't think so i think it's gonna be there how do you give orders you just press the spot button requesting medical assistance you just press q on pc i don't know what spot is on console is it still right bumper or whatever uh what no one knocks in the beta what's the deal with the hand hit market it's when you get an assist spotted enemy 240 degrees 150 meters i want to get off this road otherwise i'm just sniper bait and helicopter bait i feel like my sensitivity needs to be a bit quicker as well [Music] the hell who was that someone just shot at me now you can go is that a zip that's a zip line isn't it i want to grab that zip line you can actually cut your shoe and redeploy it like you can in warzone now too uh hey scott are you running a dual pc setup for a stream and what fps yeah i am running your pc scott um my fps is like 90 to 100. that guy was over there wasn't he yeah there's no way that i don't think you could stream this at 440p decent quality without a second pc what do i think about sliding i think it's okay but it needs to cool down like you can you can slide jump and then slide again like it needs a bit it needs a bit of a cooldown oh my god so my dog is still alive because i can still give it orders where's that zip over there um you see this thing at the bottom of the screen as well like that's casper's special ability i like that just looks so obnoxious to me like it's too bright and basically all it does is if someone is within i think it's like 20 meters of you and they look at you it will change to red and it does this like horrible pulse thing that just it's it's really really big i know that their intention is so you notice it but i think it's just way too big hopefully i can demonstrate it's kind of like what's that perk in in warzone this is the big zip line here and i get all the way up without dying high alert i think it's called in warzone modern warfare so when someone looks at you your screen kind of flashes on whichever direction they are it's kind of like that but i just don't like how it's been implemented here you go away um now i'd want to put my long range scope on there our forces have secured sector charlie [Applause] dude sniping so i love that versatility there you can just quickly switch scope that dude's gonna want to kill me now they saw where i am on the killcam what are you firing up oh man that sound that sniper sounds so good quite a bit of lead and drop as well at this different distance 280 meters oh we lost e i didn't realize are you dodged that really really someone's got my number now [Applause] on the top look at that they're on the little bit that connects to the rocket that guy's tea bagging oh that's funny that's funny sniping is good you like sniping do you j turret coin sound again yeah i suppose it does sound like uh i don't know like um a mario coin like the headshot sound the thing it's kinda like that in it uh santa claus thank you for becoming a member anyone that becomes a member can join the discord by the way if you go to jackfraggs.com discord all the info is on there if you remember or a twitch sub if you've got um amazon prime you can do it on there as well if you want access is there a guy here see that red there's pulsing there see that oh i can't stand that i think that's way too big what's this jet doing i should have hit that rocket see why i'm trying to call in the wildcat it's unavailable did you see that dude is the movement like bf5 um some similarities yeah there's definitely some similarities i mean obviously bf5 didn't have tactical spin i think that's it you can still dive left and right you can still go prone you love to see osprey um i mean if you if you want osprey gameplay i've got to be in a squad does that give me a little speed boost i think it does that doesn't even damage the tank [Music] stop it i need rocket pods or something that's what i need this isn't really air-to-ground this one sadly ppp hopefully that person's given up no they're not giving up oh you're kidding that was so close god i love this out here there's someone down here maybe ah does the jet regain health yeah it does please i need help 128 players yeah yeah everyone locks onto you beep beep look at these guys over the back of deer here oh that was a really good spawn you've got to go for those rocket kills don't you you have to you have to go for it we spawn up here stop being mean helicopter i think there's that's where that infantry was down there oh just need a second all right i'm not staying there go out here i swear there's some snipers out here i want to try and kill does it have spotting um dude why are you following me go away it's made out of ammo hopefully someone hits that no you can spot vehicles and you can like make pings like that but it doesn't have traditional spotting in it they were all they were up on that on there weren't they before there's a tank over there there's no recons here well there might be if i check my little drone here so you can use this to spot people but you can also use it as an emp that disables vehicles and turrets and stuff like that but it's got about 250 meter range on it you can put c4 on it as well i don't think there's anyone around me like how do i even like how do i spot i don't know see that will stay there now though that will stay in the air and if i want to access it again i can that guy's wearing armor that's why i don't like armor you can hit someone twice with a sniper and they don't die head up to the marker come on wrong way to the marker go there's a turret there hello change the direction there there's so many targets like 128 players i'm like who do i aim at the last shot the rocket's taking off too late to destroy it now foreign ryder also you never get rest like i don't think i've been rezzed once i think the sound of that headshot changes depending on the distance you know that was a different sound wasn't it i know someone here i need them hills [Music] when you're sprinting don't let me die it's quite simple oh the one in the back work out there i might try the lmg next game what's the constant ticking it's it's just the soundtrack that's how the soundtrack is [Music] look to see some dmr thank you for the gameplay love your content especially the dream team who's the dream team because i play with a lot of people santa are you talking about like tomorrow acolyte he's about westy stodd talking about level cap xbox and matt the old school squad up don't the lmg is terrible okay lmg fries i mean we've got stark contrast there in the chat uh jacob that's been becoming a member 11 months best gun so far probably the assault rifle the m5a3 it feels like it's the best all-round one [Music] he's talking about chicken oh i see tommy rage is it tommy and bong is that the dream team i've got the ak here try the ak what is this am i in the little bird here or the attack helicopter i i can't tell you can't switch view or anything like this gun's fine but when you're in the tanks now secondary weapons it's just kind of almost impossible to use now this guy's not a good pilot i'm glad that i jumped then [Music] very glad that i jumped can i um grapple hook onto that [Music] um armor piercing see how it changes when you can lock onto something it needs to come closer though about that i'll spray that's so annoying i feel like if you pull something like that off should be a one-hit kill shouldn't it you can graph on a drone yeah i saw that uh luke thank you for the one night hunter thanks for becoming a member young bob ross cheers for the five do you think sniping needs a buff i don't know you don't want sniper rifles to be too overpowered because they just get annoying uh night hunter thanks again i can't stand that thing that pops up at the top of the screen as well like it's it's like literally about that big isn't it enemy lost majority on the whole screen crazy like a big uh a big forehead it just pops up is this still working [Music] oh yeah i mean it doesn't have a gun on it though like for the pilot i'm gonna try and [Laughter] goodbye it was an enemies anyway didn't want it maybe they didn't realize you can cut the shoe uh andre thanks for the same been watching for six years your channel is what got me into battlefield thank you andre it's very kind of you the gleam the game is so glitchy right now yeah there's a fair few bugs in this build for sure these random buildings you just never go in someone's shooting at me then ow it didn't save my plus system from before for some reason armor definitely needs to go so you can pick um armor here so instead of a rocket launcher i can have a c5 explosive which is c4 an ammo crate medic crate we're holding an anti-air missile launcher stinger repair tool i feel like i feel like you should just get that especially if you're playing an engineer class or an armor plate and an armor plate is just a straight health upgrade and it can be replenished so i'm not sure i agree with that but it is quite a trade-off but if you're on an infantry map why wouldn't you take the armor right why wouldn't you take it but i mean i have to take the rocket launcher just because it's a rocket launch it's battlefield right i've got to try and kill some vehicles please oh there's the big have you got room in that american forces have occupied echo sector i'm friendly i got this so this is the russian alternative of the osprey gunners please shoot goodness i don't think they know shoot the helicopter gunners gonna shoot the helicopter they don't know i should have grabbed on there all right this has definitely got a bit of recall on it i can feel it like that that's like bouncing up quite a lot there maybe this hits a bit harder than the ak5c hopefully it saves it now yeah if you parachute you can grapple onto things as well you don't have to just parachute there's a lot of enemies around here got one books in well underneath me i think there's one over here i'll be shot remember guys got armor blue hit marking means armor i think yeah bounces around quite a lot [Music] heading out i don't know what that noise was then i need some ammo whoa oh it's dark in here look at this what the hell i've got like six mckays in here that was cool i don't think i've even been here before it's too dark grapple fire mckay kills mckay that looks a bit weird doesn't it oh nice shot fov they've changed the way the fov works i think my fob is like 65 but it's like horizontal rather than vertical so it's about 90 in the traditional sense now i'm gonna resume no it was gas in the building oh yeah there's gas underneath isn't it there's like a cryogenic grass grass not grass gas cryogenic gas thing look it's not saving my uh my loadout it's really annoying that's real someone out here dead oh it's getting a bit laggy isn't it i get the tesla truck over there i think a nice video looking at all the details in the beta would be good can you drive them yeah yeah you can hey stock winters good to see you again like the acceleration on this is really slow can you jump in yeah he's in i feel like with it being an electric vehicle it should just have instant acceleration it feels like it's got a bit of weight to it though there's a bit of physics there oh that's a tank [Music] i'm dead wow why was there a tank in the tunnel i just wanted to drive my little tesla truck through come on can you put a sentry on the truck maybe i don't know i've not really played as boris i don't know all right lads this roof here is just helicopter central sector c is under attack i don't know it's not saving my plus system for some reason it's really annoying me maybe it's because of the loadout that i'm picking should remember it look see's over there watch my back i will get you damn it hold up a second i'll revive that guy i got you stay still uh well i had to get a kill first you can't holster the weapon no you can't why would you want to holster it just for an aesthetic purpose or something else it's a rivian truck not a tesla i mean it looks like a tesla truck to me sir electric vehicle basically a tesla that's my barometer for electric vehicles tesla what the hell are they behind me there's a ton of recoil on that dead is that mckay what is that mckay doing wow i couldn't even see that dude rockets look weak and tiny they're not great against infantry i'm screwed this is war zone two in the new call of duty you can beat the battlefield we i've not have i even been to see i think i've even been to this point we have control of bravo sector we have control of bravo sector we can't shoot it what the hell oh dude don't let me die over here all right let's go thank you oh you can shoot while you're getting up i could see what the hell i could see my character in third person there that was strange coming over here nice kill my gun has changed as well i was revived and my gun changed oh my god you can grapple so high with that thing what the hell i look at this guy that's gotta be about right i mean there's supposed to be enemies there but i don't see any maybe they've killed them all who knows i've not tried a c4 jeep yet use the shotgun um okay i have to get up close and personal though with the shotgun they've occupied no refund that not work that didn't work i mean that just doesn't work punch him off all i want to do is go through the tunnel i want to call in a vehicle i can't do that it's just bugged it doesn't work yeah why is everyone a specialist character it's just how they've they've decided to design the game that way i think it's mainly for live service and monetization that that's happened and also to give the characters a bit of narrative so the players care about them a bit more i guess it's definitely a a big change though compared to what battlefield normally is where it's just generic soldier it's gonna be the biggest sticking point i think with this game i'm gonna do my spider-man thing see you later boys that's a long tunnel american occupation stop the u.s forces from conquering every sector well nothing's dangerous a attack helicopter here come on let's get your rocket launchers out oh there's me freezing to death i need ammo ammo is a big problem holy [ __ ] what the hell what was that oh my god what is going on should we go up and see all right this gun doesn't have any recall on not much anyway okay there's a lot of spread a storm i haven't seen the storm is the storm coming is that it no that can't be the storm where's the storm ow eddie maria let's go here give me some meds she just jumped off thanks for the two uh this is a two-month-old build andy so i mean dice said that they fixed a lot of the the bugs in this and polished and optimized and everything so i don't know how close it's gonna be to the final products to be honest with you i have to wait and see they say that they've uh fixed a lot of the bugs so time will tell you know twenty two thousand viewers in here guys if you're enjoying the stream hit that like button thank you it's great way to help support me oh my god arrest me legend yeah this is obviously the m16a3 of battlefield 2042 the all-round assault rifle [Applause] on pc you can just like that's on the the recoil is almost vertical you just pull straight down there's a little bit of spread not much oh my god tank where did that come from what's up jordan thank you is it hardcore mode not in the beta but you could make you can make your own hardcore mode in portal probably you can just make your own server with like hud turned off less health more weapon damage friendly fire that kind of thing i want you guys to see the rocket exploding but it's not initiated the launch sequence yeah i'm begging you that you just save my plus system please let me go on top i don't know why that let me it shouldn't let me fire that grapple hook because it wasn't in range it looked like it used it anyway i was trying to figure out what was going on there without tank i think someone's just called it in what video settings am i using uh lord stink mostly medium couple of high that's three in a row that's not bad a casual gamer love from south africa do a collab with dr disrespect teaching the battlefield ropes i'd love to play with doc but i don't know him so and i've said this before i'm not going to be that guy that's like hey wanna play if it happens it happens it's all good yeah we'll try a shotgun now yeah i tried running on ultra but it it just feels a bit too laggy and stuttery for me to enjoy it i get about 60 70 fps on ultra so i prefer playing on medium high where i can get like 90 to 100 instead what's up wizam how you doing hey rob 20 minutes from download can't wait superman yeah enjoy it deluxe edition will have extra maps no i don't think so all the maps are free whatever edition you have there's going to be seven all-out warfare maps and six portal maps at launch okay i like it but i think the ui needs to overhaul yeah i mean i agree with you the the ui i think it could like some elements of it i don't mind but it's just like the glow and the size of things that really gets me so shotguns then so we'll try i'll tell you what we'll try playing as boris because we've not played him yet shotgun that's the revolver isn't it stick with the rocket launcher don't know why people like run at the start when you can just get a vehicle why can i not spawn on that american forces will take every sector if they aren't stopped slugs we're going on the roof so i don't know how good these slugs are turret down so this turret is more effective when you're near it but turrets in video games are usually terrible in pvp anyway so i don't think it's going to be a match option or anything i will test we'll see like will it will it shoot people from here if i put it here my sentry is ready i'm i don't think it's going to shoot anything probably has a really small range on it okay everyone just chilling up there you think i can get that guy with a slug shotgun not gonna get attacked have they gone there you've gone underneath there's a little underneath bit here why if i put it like here i can hear someone's footsteps guys i heard footsteps ragdoll's gone mad my turret gonna stay there though i don't know it's funny [Music] see immediately i'm missing the grapple hook i'm like like it's too good let's go and marco let's go i'm chewing something there uh sorry what what's the range on this shotgun oh they're on the roof above okay i'm just like i'm i need to be mckay i need to get up there [Music] what the hell where did that go we need the mckays to get up there and just like kill him we'll be here all day someone dropped ammo as well that's cool is there a way to make the heli not tilt up when you press the wk um i'm not sure 150 degrees 115 degrees why someone just stare at me it's so weird oh no we're screwed let's go down here again standby that's on my back is there a ladder there oh that's there was an enemy there that was that's like the battlefield rose skin right there i mean what the hell couldn't see that guy at all i want to go back there well that's just a mess there isn't it are we losing b they've occupied i had to kill the dog i'm sorry i'm so dead here so dead i think my turret's gone as well i flank all the way around maybe they won't know what the hell what the hell let's move there's a lot of junkiness can i get to the other side from here slug isn't that good the elevator is turned off or something i don't know american i mean uh sorry is that should that be possible from that distance two shot from here move to that location [Music] yes i'm gonna have to get that gun i know outclassed by the m5 like that's insane the fact that you can two shot someone with the slug like no you just gotta you just gotta go over that headshot is that a tank on the roof i think i think there was a tank on the roof guys oh my squad's dead what chaos have i spawned into uh slugs so it's kept my attachments now for once that's good peekaboo what the hell i mean come on you just hit them once in the head and then that's it they're done not sure about that can i get across this big open ground hang on why is there a jet there it's normal century okay i mean it's full battlefield moments right here guys that would have been good i kind of like the slug i kind of like the shotgun now guys i'm i'm you know thank you for recommending it good shot good sentry ready the other guy killed me don't get frozen to death mr freeze [Applause] i do have the slugs in still that's ai there i think that was a jet oh my goodness what is going on hey maria please we talked about this put the slugs back on ah i do not like the ui man it's ugly a lot of people agree with you yeah i profound thank you for the five shotgun plus slow ground equals pump action dmr am i alive i got rez thank you for the rest i think i should leave this place yeah should go oh my god take a shot every time you get killed by an ai i think i've been killed by an air once so far in an hour and a half come on medic there's so many medics around you can do it i believe in you no ruined no device or boris i want to get in there with a shotgun like that would be sick no i hate this place i actually hate it stop it stop travel sector has fallen to us forces the majority of sectors are under our control that was an ai wait that squad mate no don't run that way don't run that way i'm gone i'm dead um you know what direct time let's do this little bird let's get on that roof start chewing people up with a vector where's the tornado i don't know it's like a five percent chance that it spawns i'm not seeing it yet so i'm really sad i didn't i didn't get it in the capture event and i haven't had it so far today i mean i've only been playing flex set for an hour and a half today so they've got robot dogs and everything [Music] [Applause] [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah i think i'm the only one here from i do it's fine reloading reloading is that a bigger magazine yeah 41 in that suppressor red dot sight okay flying hawkeyes are you ready to take the roof alright let's go i've got a medic here now as well don't shoot me in the back don't shoot me in the back all right we are capturing this now is that veto coming over someone get it maybe someone got it oh no airport 0 60 degrees 50 meters away from my position oh that's nice i like that vector is that a tiered reload yeah it is it's good okay so we can destroy right we can actually destroy the rocket now you see how the arms have opened up that means it's vulnerable but really you need like an attack helicopter or a tank or something see if i can get one in uh no they're all unavailable it sucks i don't think i've got enough rockets to do it if there's anyone that's watching the stream that's on the server go over to the rocket and choose it explosives are how you do it quick this tank here there's a lot of enemies there though recon ranger too many too many tanks in play i can't spawn one oh my goodness the recall on that's pretty insane from a distance i think i'm in cover help me get back here now you're gonna have to kill him you're gonna no okay see if i can get an attack helicopter i just wanna show you guys this that's not an attack helicopter but it'll do i can get over there in time i just hammer it from here no are they even going to reach no they're not even going to reach we get closer yeah just shoot the rocket at the bottom that'll teach it they basically just hammer it with explosives objectives come on no one else is doing it i don't know if i've got enough firepower to do it it is a massive explosion as well no no don't look onto me please is that it needs more uh what oh here we go [Music] oh my god how cool is that it sounds incredible i love that we got it ladies and gentlemen we got him not much point me trying to say that a vehicle on there i'm gonna be big boom if you're on the ground as well it throws a load of fully secure big pieces that you basically you know and you can actually get hit by it and die can i be a rocket that's what i want i want to be a rocket i can finish it i'm going to go to space with jeff bezos and elon musk and richard branson take me to space [Music] take me [Music] this one they just instantly jumped out of it okay hey get off assist oh [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] i'm dead i'm dead cool actually dodge that what [ __ ] it out no way bro the jet out of nowhere you don't like the comments by the characters uh diomas yeah i've heard a few people say that they don't like that the characters just say random stuff it kind of takes them out of the game a bit you know i get that completely get that we've lost b again what's going on here at f there's some infantry around there i love that vector so good come on got it nice i hear a footstep then i did hear a footstep see that's how the ai looks you see it's like a generic soldier is there any way to disable it i don't think so ryan have i tried sniping yeah i have they've gone to provide the ai hey i i guess i guess you can revive the ai in that case but i don't see much point in that american forces will take every sector if they aren't stopped oh we made a bit of a comeback here but i think we're going to lose [Music] what the radio in that radio why is there a radio the radio blame stuff random this place oh there we go i was looking for that he can throw most sectors is there a tank on the roof or was that downstairs there is a tank on the roof ah too many there's a boat loves it look for easter eggs i don't know if there'll be any easter eggs on this build of the game to be honest makuu because usually easter eggs are put in like at last minute when the developers have got free time because it's it's not really a critical thing for the game right so i don't see why there'd be that many in this build kendall thanks for the one the developers tend to put easter eggs in in their free time so and you know if they're just working on fixing the game and making sure it's just bug-free as possible i probably don't have time for that right now this corridor what is is it supposed to be pitch flat what's going on with that can you turn the lights off do you guys know we've actually got majority again here just about i'm spawning that guy i don't care if they're in combat just let me spawn i'm going back down forces have there all of echo sector we know [Music] this is so weird there's a turret down there oh my god that torch is awful that's like bf3 torch okay i think i cleared it that's so disorientating i know they run back that vector's sick though it's really good close range oh dude can you raise me [Music] so i don't know if you know about how revives work in this game but if you're one of the medic specialists the first one is maria there is another one apparently she can revive anyone but other classes can only revive people in their squad but it's kind of like how it is in bf5 uh santo thank you so much 34 months man that's crazy uh kendall thanks for the five you know what i was upset they delayed the launch of the game but after playing the beta today i feel like there is still a lot to be done yeah for sure kendall what's going on with this vehicle it was all like emp or something [Music] when you press the c5 trigger there are multiple messages kind of like an easter egg okay i'm not using yet jb [Music] opinion on casper's ability um i think it's terrible dean i think the ui is way too big for it as well now weeping moon you can only revive people in your squad as far as i know unless you're a medic you hate the background music well you can turn it off if you want i think i've got mine at 70 or something how do you throw the c5 just like in bf4 he's right click and left click to explode i'll give it a go this this round hey buyers what's up man good to see you what are my pc specs um i think there's a command for it if you do exclamation mark specs you can just see the most important bits how is the sniping it's it's good dion yeah it's good right okay so like that turret's not very good as far as i'm concerned i'm boris clicking mckay but it's not letting me switch i can only be boris no only boris's don't like that uh tom thank you for the turn we love you jack that's right kanye just a few sectors left to secure there's nothing here oh this round's been about mid-match as well and i've still i've still not seen so i mean about the guns like how can you how can you possibly use this i've still not seen the tornado can i change now you only have to do the command once guys what okay finally so boris no i don't like you boris stop okay c5 frag grenade okay we'll try that go with that can i there's a helicopter there i wonder if i could grapple onto it and see for it we have majority control didn't let me do it we have secured sector foxtrot was never sniped here a second ago beep i don't i don't know if it has a distance on it if you actually look at it it says distance so if i put one down it does change so it's going up 12 30 14 15. does it have a range 31 meters i don't know it'd be cool to do some myth busting on this game a dk kicks thank you can you turn the air off you can turn it off on your own servers i think but i think if you're playing all that warfare with in a public match i don't think you can turn it off now but the thing is like in theory you should never see ai if you live in a populated region you should rarely ever see it because it just replaces players [Music] [ __ ] again without being shot in the back there i think what's happening in the beta there's a lot of ai because people are queuing into a game and then it spills up a new server and then when they leave the server they're being replaced by ai and maybe not enough people are being put back into the matches that are live already i would guess that's what's happening but yeah in theory when the game's out you should just never see all right i'm dead it just shouldn't let you use it if it i doesn't a reload sometimes you can use it when it doesn't actually pull you weird but yeah if you've got portal just you could just run your own server and just turn ai off i thought there are more enemies here what the hell are you firing up lily mooch which marker trying to capture this point tango down three people here now are they all dead now i think they're all dead the tornado only happens on certain map well it's just a chance that it happens it's a low chance i think it's like five percent but yeah i've still not seen it you know really sad about it i will save you lilly moosh we can't stay here that's friendly what the hell what is going on uh rick is there a comoros anymore there is but it's not in the beta build of the game uh dean thanks for the five i wonder if they made an easter egg of sharknado well you know what battlefield's history is like with sharks and now there's a tornado right on the map do you want me to get in like why did you fly so low i'm gone they're there i was being shot from here but i saw a marker on the mini map from which height is your parachute open you can open it manually whenever you want you can just spam spacebar and open it whenever you want you can cut it as well like warzone that's it redeploy cut it redeploy i grapple this guy grapple fire on the roof look at that body dude this vector is awesome oh no there's a little gap there sniper bullet drop is pretty major kendall yeah it is i mean the the sniper the bolt action that's in the game i think the bullet velocity is a little bit faster than the ones in bf4 and i imagine that there'll be sniper rifles in this game that have like 900 meter seconds maybe a thousand me hundred meter a thousand meters a thousand meters a second in terms of bullet velocity so you know they'll be quick let's fly it's just uh what is that it's so random it's just something hovering in the sky i think they'll probably be unlockable snipers that are quicker in the full game little doggo i'm dead so many on that roof hey jonathan from south africa what's up can you try and get a finisher i got one earlier fine like there's nothing that special about them to be honest they're kind of bugged as well right now did i just punch through that fence i wanna i wanna get up here and see for someone no oh terry got me time to kill i like the time skill echo i think it's fine hey lincoln what's up all right this point is really annoying me i want to kill everyone oh my god that turret is ruining me i can't stand for that i have to kill it i'll do the same thing over and over again the definition of insanity okay please george is armed and ready he's gone i just had to kill that player they were annoying me are they going to respawn in time i don't know there's only 60 tickets 320 degrees 70 meters away from my position 70 millimeter weave in my pc when they go can i kill him in the grapple what do you think our forces are nearing majority control of the sectors no i wanted to grapple the grapple kill no margin for error we win now or we run i mean we're not going to win where is the spawn vegan it's not in sf i think spawn beacon will probably be a specialist gadget feels like it's too strong to be a open gadget [Music] can we play breakthrough not yet jpk the beta only has one map and conquest that's it hey paul you went to see the beeping noise live it's far better live what do you mean the bbbb when you get locked on or something else uh geofox thanks for the five you will know when the tornadoes come in because it will start storming at raining yeah yeah i've still not seen it like it's pain i just want to see it how do you change your armor you have to select it instead of your gadget it's the open gadget gabriel you press f you right click ads and press f but if you spawn with that hybrid sight you have to take it off and then put it back on otherwise it doesn't let you switch it's bugged [Music] should i do sniping this game you want to see a bit of sniping a few people were asking for sniping so no medals anymore i think there are medals so if you want armor you put it on here so if i'm doing sniping maybe i should go armor or actually health sniper rifle i'd like to give the dmr a go as well so try that magnum all right lots of people saying sniping so i'm gonna do it please dice just let me spawn i'm begging you uh michael thanks for the 10 cheers for streaming miss no problem excuse me what kind of a spawn was that oh firepower so mate oh no sniper with a med kit well i've got to get up there ready don't i i got this what can i put on this oh my god what you can get a armor piercing round that damages vehicles a scope on it i mean surely it's not it's not going to do that much damage is it let's be honest that's right it actually does you get you get a hit marker with that what the hell armor-piercing rounds there oh man this is a dirty spot here [Music] can hear some nice music obviously shoot the driver out maybe run on that all roof let's go higher they've got the point [Music] see any targets there on there maybe i don't know where that guy was i'm not sure about that scope might be a different scope that one on [Music] quickly i've got seven bullets left guys i kill the tank my armor piercing rounds it's so weird that you can do that with the magnum what's the point why can you put armor-piercing rounds in the mag fair enough let's go here a couple of people here and there's a tank there actually so we'll go there we'll go with the original plan i kind of feel like that scope is better yeah exertion god horrible up close here are all sorts of tropical creatures making noise [Music] what is that ah [ __ ] reloading what creature makes that noise guys anyone know monkey bird rank seven you know there are 999 ranks in this game it's something like you get to level 100 [Applause] and then after that it's almost like a prestige system where you can use these supplies do a thousand ranks like that's crazy i think that's how it is sharks i don't think it sharks in the trees being totally honest with you i'm gonna go with it's not sharks i need a hostile ranger we need to secure more sectors before the whole map falls oh my god that wasn't a headshot well [ __ ] [ __ ] you have to get the 999 in the beta there's no way how am i going to get to 999 guys i actually got rez that can't believe it [Applause] can go down contextual audio guys i've somehow acquired a sniper rifle with the suppressor as well i'm not sure about this but that thing's it sounds like a v1 from battlefield bf5 i think like we're gonna have to flank that squad over there otherwise they're gonna keep killing us they know where we are we know what they are a bit of a standoff isn't it must be a bird a bird uh lord man candy thank you for the fire that fires really slowly can't spare much but hope this gets you a snack or something while you give us good stuff to watch thank you very much man candy it's very funny yeah i'm not sure about that magnum made supplies use them enemy neutralized we had to be neutralized we take an f there we are so it has started to rain so we might get to see the tornado maybe i hope so oh good sound though i'll just run in there i guess you can snipe the pilots i don't know helicopter one of theirs 200 degrees around 70 meters from my position i think that audio is contextual as well hostile helo located enemy helo 190 degrees 70 meters from my position the more you know myth busted up what the hell i just want the helicopter no no no no no stop the us forces from conquering every second there's no audio no there you go we're back in the room boom [Music] fingers crossed i don't see a tornado yet guys see a tornado i don't see a tornado guys i'm sorry uh kieran thank you so much for that parasocial relationship you cherish so much you know it bloodline back to the 20. doc and see elena are wondering about battlefield superstars on youtube i told doc you have more subs than him oh dear beep that's very kind of you thank you come on we get lucky nice [Music] come on tornado where is it all i want

chat thank you for summoning it the entire team's there it's the first time i've seen it we're going we're gonna go see it no i click i clicked on the helicopter and it just spawned me on the ground hostiles occupying most sectors forced them back eastbourne timer active there we go have a look oh my god what happens if you fly above it someone told me it looks really cool no no no no i just want to see the tornado whoa it's ruining my helicopter whoa no no we're losing control oh bro what where's my helicopter gone [Applause] i'm just gonna i'm gonna get a jet if i can get a jet i want to fly

god no no no no no no everyone's going to come to this point now the whole server is going to be here please let me use jet click click click that's from hardline that is that feature yes right here we go is that an enemy jet what the hell oh my god can we kill the tornado sheesh oh my god it just messes with the controls so weird look at that guy flying around in it whoa and get my own back on that attack helicopter we have captured all of delta very good very good is it gonna make the the missiles miss messes with you i am big time once i get hit here [Music] oh it missed me [Music] so annoying my god it's so cool there's a deep freezer know [Music] let's go check it out am i in it oh the majority of sectors are under our control i would like to see the tornado i mean that literally just what there's containers in it no it's picked up some containers [Music] that's so sick it's like the wizard of oz oh my god whoa i'm in it no it's freezing me to death i'm like this i've gone oh no no i can't get out of it i'm stuck in it i'm stuck guys please i don't want to die like this yeah we don't have the specialist with the wingsuit in this build of the game this guy just going around in circles what is he doing whoa [Music] it's got some cars in there as well what's it look like from the ground absolutely insane it keeps pulling me towards it i can't get away from it no what the hell [Music] i want to fly a helicopter and see what happens it's kind of cool it's just literally gone across the whole map we i love how people just fly around it it's gone system shutdown uh bad thank you for the 20 to help with the purchase of an umbrella yeah i think i'll need one i think i'll need one for this game thank you twenty dollars that's a decent umbrella guys goodbye tornado it was nice knowing you i hope you're going to destroy other big things on the other maps imagine if you have the tornado like here and then the rocket exploding at the same time might be stick but yeah we shot the rocket a couple rounds ago and exploded it sick pretty cool i always forget to do the tactical sprint so i'm just not used to doing that in a battlefield game [Music] grenades will [Applause] see my calling system just doesn't work anymore this is broken load up lads let's go how was that noise can i get in and shoot it no oh it's going it's going watch this watch this oh no no no no oh wait oh debris oh my god that looks insane when you're on the ground what the hell dude that is crazy i mean those particle effects are nuts wow let's get going [Applause] ah don't let me die over here don't let me die over here yeah that was super cool that explosion love that big boom baby big booms one down you're welcome you're welcome there's so many infantry here i was freezing to death then that's horrible they are desperate what's up show y'all yeah i'm good thanks how's the performance not great it's okay could be a lot better i mean they say that they've they've optimized the current build that they've got and this one's two months old so hopefully they're telling the truth a sniper rifle [Applause] casper the friendly ghost there okay i can feel my fps is about 60 right now it's not great really got to go for those headshots [Applause] you're the peak again this is pc punjabi [Music] good night banana thank you for coming that united states graphics card 60 fps is not great i mean for most people it's fine chloe but like on pc if you use like a high frequency monitor you've got a high spec cpu gpu you want to be pushing at least 120 constantly let's go brandon why are people saying let's go brandon what's that mean not much destruction yeah definitely not in this map i don't know what the other maps are like the chat is insane yeah it is jay medium thai graphics thomas hey johnny getting the damage on it i like that like that a lot so i haven't used the dmr have i can you open the settings yeah give me one sec try the armor excuse me that was rude that's a grenade launcher oh yeah settings see you only 40p mix of high medium i was processing on low because i just don't like how those effects look uh jimmy thank you for the 10. anyone figure out how to swap between the three and 1.5 yeah jimmy we talked about that earlier you have to equip the site if you spawn with it and then unequip it put it back on and then it should work and when you ads just press f or whatever your melee key is can you really just switch attachment whenever you want yeah you can set one sir no problem facts bit higher so that's so i mean that doesn't zoom in much for a dmr barely see that dude does xbox play with pc catch yeah it's got cross play so the way crossplay works in this game is for next-gen consoles and pc so that's ps5 series xs and playstation ps5 xbox series xs pc sorry they all play together but you can turn off cross play if you turn off crossplay you will only play with people on your console so if you want ps5 and you turn off cosplay you'll just play ps5 players if you're on xbox series s or x turn off cosplay you'll just play with people on that platform same goes for pc as well and then for old old gen consoles they just play with each other and it's the same thing like if you disable it you'll just play with people on your platform what is going on here boom how's the big booms going down i'm reloading when it sounds cool doesn't seem to back much of a punch though that wasn't bad hello you got to get those having trouble headshots the hostiles from securing objectives [Music] it's got so much visual recall on it i need ammo ammo's a real problem no no one ever drops ammo basically well you can pick it off enemies like that five oh my god is that really all you get you got ammo mocking threats i'm here there's no rammer nose gamer that's not cool new marco get there fast get there fast south african guy this is can i kill this guy in five bullets i mean he hasn't got any there's no gunfire there he was shooting his gun but the gun wasn't making any sound you guys say that all right i'm completely out of ammo how does one ammo oh no oh no no that's a wrong burn there's a tank there you can't ask for it in beta either yeah i mean i could can you change magazine does that work really i take ammo instead of the armor plate see that's quite a trade-off isn't it you can resupply yourself but we still remain strong you won't be able to use armor anymore not the birds there's a one hand american forces will take every sector if they aren't stopped i mean this does not what the hell what the physics that handles crazy so i'm actually i've got three xbox players in my squad right now this area looks really nice yeah no dlss yet but nvidia said that it is in the game it will have dlss it's got reflex in it imagine if there was just like 10 people here i'll be sneaky [ __ ] [ __ ] just chill out casper it's fine you see anyone there the camera shake yeah yeah on the gunner seats it's messed up it doesn't work all right there's no one here we need to secure more sectors before the whole map falls what does that do alpha sector has fallen to american forces i don't know what that did i just press the button does it just what it just shuts the doors like is that it what's the point of that can't they just open them to get back in there my bait is downloading right now good for you dustin each type of mag has different ammo right an extended mag would be great for this dmo belongs to us [Music] look at this nice looking car we got bay what's up with the time i just wanna i wanna test this um assisting threats this drone see if i can emp the tank yeah you can actually disable the tank look at that they jumped out oh there was another tank pain try switching your mag okay hey jacob american forces have taken foxtrot sector guillermo it's giving you planetside vibes no i haven't played planetside 2 for ages i played the original quite a bit but then planetside 2 i barely touched look at these lights on there they do oh no i mean we're gonna get ruined by that attack helicopter you can hear the wind that's cool someone over there that's all we're piercing so oh yeah until it damages it [Music] and it's instantly replaced with another one [Music] grab the emma not do much damage though is it let's be honest ow i'm reloading i'm reloading you get a bigger sight than this what the parachute sometimes you hit it and you don't get a hit marker as well that's messed up if you want to kill helicopters this is where you come if i had a stinger or like an anti-air vehicle or something right here trying to get yes got the pilot so you just don't get moments like that in bf1 and bf5 because they don't have helicopters and you miss out on all that helicopters that middle ground you know they just add so much to the game the fact that they're here what are you firing at over there somewhere [Applause] you run out of ammo so quick this just reminds me of armor again bro how many times how many times we have to shoot this guy look at this roof covered in enemies there's a robo dog there as well yeah i don't know about this dmr i feel like it hasn't got enough stopping power although that's got more damage not armor piercing though reloading now not moving i feel like i need to be at closer engagement ranges what the jet get him that's it ranger again that roof there no i'm just trying to be on my roof and just chill okay let me break get some health back all underneath me huh [Music] oh look at that the team's pushing in as sector if well aren't stopped these stupid parachutes man one down one down i'm still that time [Applause] i'm starting to get used to it now i think if you operate that medium range that's where it's hitting the spots you gotta go mid-range and you gotta hit headshots got to reload i don't really ever see myself using this little drone though this guy's got move out cancel that you were there somewhere uh thiago thank you for the ten cheers from brazil and thank you very much luca thanks for the five love your content what do you think about the beta so far i was quite disappointed and i think they need more time to get it ready uh drinky thank you for the 10 the damage is odd in this game there's so many little things that bother me about it i was really looking forward to bf4 vibes hopefully paul can make it feel a bit more battlefield to me i suppose that's the point of portal though isn't it drinking you just you just make the battlefield that you want to right so if you wanted to make a just a world war ii server you could do that i mean that's a four shot kill for me there like if i would have hit that last bullet dragging instead of my teammate 190 degrees 250 meters away um luka yeah i mean i did uh share some thoughts earlier um i mean i think like it's really fun um and i'm glad to be playing a sandbox battlefield game again um i think the ui needs a lot of improvement i think the footstep audio needs a lot of work i'd love to see a bit more destruction um i'm 50 50 on the specialist system right now i feel like there's going to be a lot of imbalance there it's very obvious who the meta specialists are going to be um but overall i think the game's fun i wish it ran better i wish there was more performance but i said this this build of the game's two months old and they've fixed a lot of bugs and put more features in optimized it a bit so we'll just have to wait and see you know take the ammo you see those pilots i'm just glad to be playing a modern battlefield game again that's the biggest thing for me you know with modern weaponry vehicles helicopters jets gadgets like that's battlefield for me and you know that this game is hitting that spot for me in a lot of respects but it's not perfect know i've only played a few hours as well sorry i'm sorry where'd you go come here i'm gonna disable this helicopter [Music] what the i suppose what you could do is you could put c4 on the drone or you you have your teammate put c4 on it and then [Music] you disable it with the emp and then you can blow it up really easily with the c4 but yeah i mean i i just advise you to try it yourself like my opinion of it doesn't really matter like it's going to be open beta in in a day so if if you can download it it is like 18 gig just give it a try for yourself you know see what you think what i think about the game you know it's irrelevant really it's up to you you like it or not look at this and we haven't hit each other once i'll try and get up on that pylon i go for the zip uh drinky thanks for the five yeah the dmr i just i'm not feeling it guys i have to be honest with you i've not tried this smg out let's try this one a rocket what's this one handling i want to go there that's where the guy was see if they notice me just punched him in the back of the head once that's a sad way to go isn't it rage quit potato that's a great name look at this tesla here [Laughter] he's just living his best life driving across the tarmac beeping his own cut down in his prime really quite hard to hit people on that especially if you have a uh smg or a rocket boys what are the birds doing on the floor birds should not be on the floor especially when there's a war going down i'm really interested in hazard zone as well on the roof if someone said there's a ladder here where's the ladder yeah right there unbelievable scenes i want to spawn i'm capping it now bye have a great time no i was going to take that how do you do this you crashed lads i'd like to see the baby can i switch [Music] this one's locking on blitzkrieg we've been playing this since 2am absolutely nailed the bf experience hey slay the noob people comparing it to war zone i mean it's got some it's got some similar things to war zone but like warzone copied a lot of battlefield stuff so what came first i i think it's cool that games can borrow mechanics from each other like as long as it leads to a fun game and experience i don't care like like this game for example i think like modern warfare has made the tactical sprint really popular in fps games and um yeah i quite like it in battlefield now it just gives you a bit of momentum i suppose when you need it although it doesn't have a cooldown in this you can just use it forever but then like with warzone warzone added helicopters you know helicopters have been a staple of battlefield since bf2 i understand why people will compare the games because that's that's the context that they have right that's what they know and that's fine nothing wrong with that i swore i saw someone on the radar don't know the footsteps sounds terrible hard to tell no one on this point either cheeky little truck here does it have a radio i've heard radios i don't have to put it on though all i've got is horn weird some cars have had radios i swear there's two people here now they're driving around everyone over here win this maybe u.s forces have captured delta sector oh no oh i can hear him driving around [Music] oh get wrecked my point are we gonna lose this one radio team oh there i couldn't see it because that's securing objective is it just is it royalty free audio i don't know oh someone else hannah i was in the car the whole time that's just music there's someone here again ah they came for me finally isn't the capture time too long were you supposed to be there with other people like i'm playing this solo are the radio's talking now well the radio isn't talking but there's a radio station talking on the radio radios can't talk this is crazy [Music] [Music] what if it adds a bit of context to the story the radio station [Music] do yeah the middle sense is terrible dead man why rock it no launch sometimes it just doesn't jack it's a 50 50 chance i think how many ai well technically there could be 127. you could make a server and just play against ai if you wanted which is that's crazy use the lmg okay i will i did say i was gonna use it earlier but then everyone went no don't use it it's terrible [Music] it was the same build duck as in the capture session uh monday that was it's exactly the same better build this is the lmg armor piercing rounds handling accuracy oh that's again hey brandon what's up our server's free yeah yeah you can just make a server for example stop the us forces from conquering every sector it looks like the hood from the game there doesn't it uh hendrick thanks for the two out of the footsteps not very g'day from australia what's up daily dungeons how you doing what weapon do i think is the best definitely the m5 for sure oh my god oh the corkscrew what the how's that possible where are we going with this you have fun with that okay i've just noticed this here i'm dead when i go up here i think there's a lot of enemies no dice didn't let me up guys didn't hear any footsteps was there footsteps oh no didn't hear any maybe there was i want to go back up there that looked fun take that zipline again oh no i don't have any squad members there bro i've not used that um heavy armored vehicle yet either we'll get up there with a helicopter do some damage and then drop out with the lmg uh oscary thank you for becoming a member [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] i mean he swears a lot doesn't it [Music] swears an awful lot there's a leader board is there i mean you get a scoreboard but the only way like that's how you see all the players so i think this is actually a full lobby oh no that's ai one two three four five six seven on this server at the moment i want to go see the baby i would like to see the baby i'm not spawning that transport vehicle there i don't want to spawn over here it takes so long to get out there conquest proceeding we now control most of them let's go here and is this going to work for me it just doesn't work just doesn't work for me i'm trying to get the vehicle deploy thing so i can oh there we go recon why doesn't it work guys it worked when we started playing it was fine legal sector so annoying i want to use that system so i can spawn a vehicle and drive over there hang on it's all my piercing isn't it that sounds good [Laughter] fair play dude just ruined me there with that our forces fully control foxtrot sector i'm not holding it i'm just pressing b see i selected the helicopter there and i was born here there were so many bugs no give me a lift right sided on my position so you look i click it and then nothing happens it just puts it away when i click it i'm literally pressing b that's all i'm doing it's just broken i think if i hold b that happens if i press b that happens i think it's just a bug i can call an attack vehicle requested in my mark what acknowledged the destination maybe i mean [Music] did you got crushed our enemies [Music] there's a lot of people around here trying to quick scope that jet then what are you firing up kind of wish there was like a big elevator that you could drive on if you were in a tank and get to the top you can't just call in a tank to the top if you want but obviously i've ruined that now haven't i do you want this tank can you take this tank take that tank i have no need for it at the time let's move over there oh here we go bye time love you [Music] go down i think i actually heard a footstep then unbelievable okay that's a lot of dead enemies let me tell the point cool yeah i mean that lmg is pretty good there wouldn't it [Music] not bad performed admirably is that what you look like when you're in your plus system whoa dude you can't just you can't just stay in your bus system all day you're gonna get killed i can get this i think the guy jumped and one of them did a synoptic thank you for coming yeah good job ow [Music] whoa [Music] nice dude i need ammo again threat located please somebody give me ammo please it's nearly dead it's like when you play warzone you just went out of ammo to kill the helicopter watch your step with the marker please ammo is a massive problem no one no one's gonna take ammo it just i almost feel like they should just have a supply station on the roof or something or underneath maybe it could just be that it's the beta and no one's picking it but i foresee it being a problem in the full game unless they just increase the how unless they increase the default ammo that you get when you spawn like it's definitely going to be an issue gamma field you think it's too bright clean [Music] um thomas thank you 19 months look at this dude is he just running around with melee why don't you have a gun what what the ai what the hell [Applause] absolute pain unbelievable things oh oh the ranger got me killed by a dogger yeah i gotta say the l on that one i'm afraid i want this i want to try that out not had a chance yet don't see many of these either what the lag what the hell happened then that was so weird uh she thank you for the five if you switch ammo types it refills your ammo all of it that's a good tip that's true that poor osprey fallen gone to the wayside i like that particle effect on the front there pushing through the air it's cool just too fast oh my team out there i think there's a jet on me though if only if i flew into them then wouldn't it whoa he flew into me the ragdoll just flying through there what the hell was that that looks so stupid [Music] i've um b again i can't stand for this no why the jets so slow i don't know oh my god look at everyone jumping i mean there's so many targets there there's almost too many targets my brain just can't handle it really difficult to control it as well why have they not shot a rocket at me yet okay that's the emp fair enough i'm gonna drive that off are you don't emp me again i'll be upset oh there's the rocket that's what we want to see come on shoot rockets at me [Music] shoot me there you go there you go did they just steal that no are you gonna rock it i'll go on this side oh my goodness that guy's got a stinger can't stay there for too much longer i'll end up being killed i like just bullying people on this roof it's good fun [Music] oh dodged that one that was sick okay here we go again they're gonna run out of rockets soon right [Music] [Music] please just kill me oh we've got teammates going here now all right they're dead that's good who killed you it's really difficult to see there is someone there no i'm not having that i got your advantage mate you're dead i it's so much fun to just fly these around the rockets barely touch the inventory though that guy just turned into an explosion that's the guy with his finger this guy here [ __ ] [ __ ] hello bb they just don't give up guys they don't give up i suppose i don't give up either have a bit of that mate i can do it all day oh no tesla is the new roadster it's dead here we're going again it never ends i mean right here but i want my team to take the point but like no one's already going up here that's a rocket from yep you okay i think i'm done now can we take it please oh no no no no you think you're getting away no no no no no secure oh they've got a rocket launcher though this guy's gonna kill me [Music] not today good night okay we've got it guys i helped i think i helped i just you know i was really mean to them on the roof for a very long time and eventually they went away and my team went up there and had a great time and that's fine i blow this up i need some help i think last minute explosion come on only seven tickets left blow up ah i thought we could get it in the end screen something [Music] how cool would it be if you could see it explode there right then i'm okay in a chopper you too if you want to see someone who's good in a chopper there's a guy called widgety bear he's insane he streams on twitch i think i'm dead on the ground everything's everything's ruined right okay we're gonna go full infantry then for the last game i've got one more game and then i've got to go but it's been really fun guys thank you for watching if you've enjoyed it so far hit that like also again a big thanks to epic games i've recently partnered up with them and basically for the next six months or so every week we're going to be streaming a new game on the epic game store and this week's game is bf2042 there's a link down in the description below to it as well and if you pre-order it or if you buy anything on the epic game store consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a kickback from that salmon can you show your chopper sound you can't turn sideways they're just default the lmg was all right i'm gonna go full sweat try hard this round guys i'm sorry we'll go full sweat frag grenade i want to switch i don't want to be boris mckay is clearly the best here we go ruined ruined ruined ruined ruined vehicle fall ruined ruined surely now sure there we go well we made it um come back here i want to talk to you about your extended car warranty what the hell is that guy doing oh you scared me need a second to reload don't do that uh hi jack it's gaz big fan love the bids or was the laugh or informative thank you very much g g on cars it's kinda where should we go to go over here let's go let's go i don't want to rocket this guy enemy hilo on my mark 200 degrees 150 meters oh miss i should do what's that breath about weird i can hear a car what are you doing car chubby object what's up chubby one enemy here there just one there yeah i think so okay and they take which point do they take first i don't know there's people down there though try this i don't know how to go on this show request receive vehicle drop incoming [Music] okay that's not bad pretty good damage the hell was that well there's a tank there oh you kidding me was that tank inside the whole time didn't even know it was there it looks like a mobile game it's a good memory isn't it here somewhere [Music] there's a cheeky little falcon in the corner there look at that what's she doing there oh no they're spawning on her now as well this is unacceptable i have to get back there do i have any squad mates i do i don't i literally don't care if they're in combat just let me spawn that's the one who killed me oh my god she's just eating the side i love how there's a guy in the gun on that it's got splash damage on it can you grapple her helicopters yeah you can but it's a bit buggy at the moment it's not it's not working great i was just chilling there still and they're all jumping again wow damn it gotta reload god damn it gotta reload is that an enemy parachute that's where i was earlier it's not a great sport sector charlie under it would have been so funny if i got killed then that one goes up does it why can't you grapple onto it from there i meant i'm friendly i'm friendly relax relax see it's fine i must clear the building still anyway bro sector i think it's about 90. x is playing this too has x been playing long how long has you been on for where are you squad mate i'm at the bottom is there like a quick way to get up the top i'm sure there should be an elevator that just goes up to the top i'm in i just walked we just walked through the door he's sinking into the ground he's gone he's back he's back that is that is very strange like that's quite buggy i'm gonna know i'm here now oh hello visit someone get over here and help me yeah there's a zip line on the outside which she just used maybe that's the play i think he's getting close to it i've taken it now okay i feel like i should clear it though like there's gonna be people here still oh lovely oh i must have been a vector let me go let me go let me go finally stinger okay i think they're all gone now i presume they're all gone are they all gone although i've got a dead teammate there so i don't know maybe someone just shoot a needle at me or something if we don't stop them they'll take every sector you'll you receive here look at this squat put some strong thighs on that man reloading let's go i tried to uh i tried to grapple the roof and body was just like freaking out then when you parachute if you press three when you've got mckay you can grapple onto things but that was obviously going too fast uh sam thank you for becoming a member you're a legend we're losing d we're losing e i feel like i should um i should try the c4 quad bike as well before i end the stream [Music] it's not a one-hit kill with a grapple you see the hit marker then thank you sam what's up grand master thank you hey corvax finn are there bots yeah there are bots um so if you look in the playlist here there's no bots on my team right now there's three on the enemy team these are bots so it's made mainly a full server like 994 no they cleared that tried to make a quad fly i think you can do that majority of sectors under our control i do actually worry about easter eggs though because the size of these maps imagine if there's some crazy easter eggs in this game like there was in bf4 i mean the amount that you'll be searching also will make it easier though because you can make your own server and just private it or whatever but man the easter eggs are going to be insane i lose enough see a guy here what's that smoke about where did that come from i didn't think you would even get smoke in this yeah we're taking this back oh no this one on it again where are they i'll train thank you man five months legend two people on it now ah all ai there's a guy up there isn't it friendly up there now i just can't ever call that in like that one doesn't work for me the rest works fine i can get a ranger bring in the dog bring in the dog come on doggo i'm sorry but that range is insane stop shooting my dog he's on your team they've just taken sector delta a vixes thank you for the five dog are you going or [ __ ] ways to go move it how'd they go that was close let's go dog what graphics medium to high down one of them love that when you drive along it makes tracks see it's all real time that is it's really impressive changes based on the surface as well [Music] our forces have secured sector charlie oh no i'm running out of armor [Music] can a 1660 ti run this well probably not i'm not gonna let low settings maybe 1080p i don't think you're going to be playing at high settings with a 1660 ti i don't think that's possible all these helicopters right there to the marker very unpredictable there what if i can get all the way out there passed out presents west if you start going too quick you can't probably shoot just a warning i've done that twice now i'm capturing a go to 2060 run it i mean it's a bit better isn't it i think up we go live now you're dead if you want to try it just try it because it's open better in a day and then you'll know if it runs around your pc [Music] [Music] other clowns are going that's when you can destroy it as soon as the clamps are off you can start destroying it let's get going oh i didn't expect that would work i did you go all the way up this i'm just assuming that someone's on the top here i don't know if they are no it's clear is it friendly [Music] can you get on it i don't know if you can get on it [Music] that's so annoying heading out that's going to blow up isn't it yeah why is everyone webster because it's clearly the best [Music] bad c4 i'd go for that webster's easily the best [ __ ] it's over this battle is won this battle is won a rohan thank you for the two you can change the magazine the barrel the grip and the muzzle i think i know the sight sorry [Music] cool right guys i'm gonna have to go um it's getting pretty late here and uh you know we've nearly been going four hours but i just want to say uh massive thank you for tuning in let me know your thoughts as well um how do you feel about this i know obviously you're just watching me play but play for yourself you know and then you can make an informed
