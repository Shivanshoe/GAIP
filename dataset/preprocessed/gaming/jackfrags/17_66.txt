it's the one and only double g snoop dogg i was gonna do like the whole lyrics but i can't embarrass myself that much i simply can't do it but researchers snoop dogs in the game now we're gonna play this is a rebirth resurgence solos i quite like this it's all right to guarantee your redeployment might go for that heavy weapon i don't know if they're like actually good though what we got airstrike ppsh in a [Applause] they must be out doors oh i got counter snoop dogged look at that it's called jack frank's by the way i'll take my death as an opportunity there go jack frank's in the cod store if you buy a hashtag cod partner i do still have a code i'm gonna go back there i think try and get a kill maybe the boat yeah i don't like to look at that someone running over as well like bang my horn here and see if i can get a free box [Applause] no that's no free box if you bang it enough sometimes the bloke goes yeah we urge her and then he gives you a box not today they're not feeling it [Applause] did i just hear someone i feel like i did the top there yeah so the cool thing about this game mode is that [Applause] it's got a countdown on it and as long as the countdown is finished you can redeploy even in solos you don't need teammates alive or anything so it's just pretty action-packed i know a lot of people have kind of stopped playing warzone now especially on caldera i think maybe the godzilla event you know when season three starts that's gonna entice a few people back so i got the repel there like rebirth just seems to be the most popular thing now caldera's just visibility is really bad and [Applause] is that the guy that killed me [Applause] revenge yes it is oh man i love it death combs is i've said it before it's the best is that an npc the gun changed mp7 look at that skin that's right oh snoop dogg's back not enough to kill him [Applause] i want this kill is that the same guy again i think it might be the one up there right up here that's the guy that i just killed it was mad on the comms let's go kill him again [Applause] there it is oh my god oh god he's not happy with me is he not at all poor guy i've not used a heartbeat sensei in ages though because they're kind of nerfed in there only 25 remain he's back again look [Applause] it's a c58 i just got a hit marker then as well that's weird i mean there was an enemy hit you saw it but i think that's like if you don't kill anyone it says that there's someone down here again it's snoop he's back that's the same guy again [Applause] i keep killing myself smooth dog there he is it's a really good model look look how good that is i feel like they must have face scanned him or something custom voice lines as well looks a lot like him maybe a bit younger someone here in the sky on the top oh can i get the finish ah just the tag he's selfish two there's two there yeah i feel like i've kind of neglected the solo warzone audience that i have because i've not really posted a solo game for ages and like these videos in the past like they always did so well in terms of uh like comments and engagement watch time oh there's three now interesting there's definitely one below one above i don't know where that third guys are they're having a fight [Applause] oh come on that's the guy that i down doesn't it you've got another shot back there i feel like it'd be rude not to no gun you see now i'm back it started the countdown i think it was like 20 seconds or something so if i can survive this if i die i can respawn he's in there i think [Applause] the decoy over there come on oh he totally took the bait there what's he got milano and a weird spr no one around right now this is stubby spr that's weird he's back he's back for more you want some more really okay just gonna face me with the pistol although it is that burst one isn't it the diamatti it's pretty decent i mean i just killed him with it so this one's gone relocating that c58 enemy team is tracking your position someone's taking it [Music] just here somewhere they must have fallen back that might be the same snoop from earlier where's the buggy now maybe i'm in there i think he's in there watch your six neighbors will be gone soon definitely over on that side maybe just right there by the door 15 meters could be could be on the roof get some knees back you're losing ground let's go get him still there yeah i missed [Music] you jump out no still upstairs this is tense isn't it but it can't mouse here there's only 11 left that balcony that's horrible would be a good chance to push now longer available make your actions count gas is closing in relocating the safe zone keep fighting jump up here can't i snoop dogg again is that the third or the fourth time i've killed myself get back to it so weird to hear snoop dogg in the game i think that was the fourth time i doubt there's anyone else here now six other people he does have an mp40 as well and a custom takedown but i haven't even had a chance to get my loadout yet you're losing ground moving above me again i know they've just come for the zone yeah i could try and sneak a load out there and show you the mp40 if i don't get killed i'm going for it it is the shiznit it's called only five remain finish this once and for all it's not a bad build it's not perfect but it's all right there's a sniper shot down here i'll get on the roof maybe i should enemy uav active god he's right there ow i didn't mean to do that there's another one i'm gonna do a little flank oh my god you can't vote when you use that so annoying [Applause] okay that was lucky oh my god i thought that was someone like jumping me or something are you still up there no one coming through there [Applause] the fire damage got him 1v1 okay come to me he's got me over there oh god oh no he wasn't five remaining he was literally right next to me oh look at that oh that hurt that really hurts 11 kills i suck at this now i can't win wars on any rule you know what you can't keep a dog down and snoop dogg will be back again for more war zone someday i'm absolutely good about that one i have to be honest guys my heart was pounding then oh well guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed it leave a like see you next time bye-bye guys i'm just editing the video and look at this look on the right they're literally right there how did i miss that i told you i was getting bad but he was right there did you see him let me know in the comments below i didn't see him ruined
