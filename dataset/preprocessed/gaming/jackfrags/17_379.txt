battlefield 6 reveal trailer it has to be coming soon may 6th battlefield 1 23rd of may battlefield 5. just like justice beaver said from the backstreet boys it's gotta be may the bf6 trailer they said spring they've run out of time aren't they let's be real anyways today we're playing some bf5 i thought that'd be a good intro for the video because everyone who's talking about bf6 at the moment can't be avoided it's everywhere and i wanted to play some bf5 today operation underground and just go hand with this empty it's been pretty weird last few days of battle though when i'm playing in the evenings on bf5 it's just a load of cheaters on pc it seemed like it i joined three servers in a row and it was a blatant cheering everyone i did report them have they been banned i don't know i hope so but it's early in the morning and i thought that maybe the cheetahs won't be up yet and i think we're good so far the rounds only just started so oh that was oh god reload couldn't shoot in time damn it i'm staying on topic i did a poll on youtube the other day and asked you guys to vote like if you had to pick one game this year to play would it be bf6 would it be this rumored cod world war two game or would it be halo infinite those were the options i got the results on my other monitor here i'll put them on the screen as well there are 352 000 votes you came out of nowhere 11 voted for cod 2021 it's more difficult than i thought they're all up there 11 voted for halo infinite and 78 voted for bf6 it's pretty big they have 352 000 votes everyone's dead i expected an awesome flag then but everyone on this point has been killed why now admittedly you could say well it's a biased vote isn't it jack you've because a lot of battlefield fans that watch your channel but last two years i've done a lot of cod videos covering modern warfare covering warzone so i know i've got a lot of people that play called the watch me but we don't even know that ah damn it we don't even know for sure if this year's con is world war two again actually it's just a rumor at this point so might be something completely different than that but that does tell me that there's just a lot of hype for the next battlefield game this corridor sucks dude what what i can't see anything because of all that smoke oh thanks for the res burns or i appreciate you buddy i've got some more dynamite boom i've run out okay that didn't work i'm leaving this is my favorite corridor now i'll just hold my swan and try and get kills hey they didn't know that try rocket maybe or i'll just get rocketed in the face it's fine res yes legend this team on point no i'm just gonna like can i get up here dice yeah there we go just gonna stay up here and never see me it's a grenade put that dynamite down that was me but the other the other team i appreciate the energy it's not prone there isn't there that was a rocket let's leave again i'm gonna we're gonna live in this office now this is where i work now if anyone wants to come see me this is where i am i don't shoot guns anymore i'm just an office admin because i hate that corridor but i'm back in the corridor guys i can't quit you corridor oh yeah shotgun then you got me it's kind of like the um what do they call it stockholm syndrome i know this corridor is bad for me but there's the potential that four people line up and i just hold them all down with the m2 carbine so i just can't i quit my job already sick of being an admin i can hear him on the right there creeping around everywhere i just wanted that gun what is it it's a sten oh ruined the rain is over oh my god look at this dude it's flaming they added that down the line here didn't used to have the flamethrower secret i'm finally pushing out to the a point you stuck at b for ages let me go this way and get around the back usually people just chill up here don't they in these buildings i think i kill that okay there's quite a few on the point i just got squad leaders man say hello to my little friend bang well now we've taken it i don't know if we should stay here we'll go back to b maybe we should just hold for a bite oh hello the whole is falling down how many times what i didn't even see that dude just appeared out of nowhere so last two battlefield games were both revealed in maybe dude we've got ea play but they said spring so june is summer in it oh my god there was so many people there so it's gotta be me it has to be if it isn't then i'm going to be sad i don't think i can wait any longer it's been a long time i didn't get any kills over there oh with that pants first what do you reckon you reckon i'd say that be a play or holy crap maybe i shouldn't be here anymore oh my god like i was called burns or and these characters got the fire on it they're all dead okay all right we're going that's kind of funny actually i did a another poll like the week before and it actually got more votes than the uh the poll about what game would you play let's do it on the floor here lively's best life and that pole was important decisions to be made would you rather have chucky milk strawberry milk vanilla milk or banana mill the metal squirrel got me thank you for the res have a lot of races this game chucky milk one with 62 percent of the vote and that poll got 414 000 words so we've got more votes in the poll about battlefield and quality i just think that's kind of funny shows what people really care about you know i'm back in the corridor again there's only five tickets i don't know if we'll get any more kills there go fishing with the dynamite almost one to win good game this was had a lot of fun can i get lucky no there it is gg i hope you enjoyed that bit of a chit chat if you did like it leave a like and a comment below thank
