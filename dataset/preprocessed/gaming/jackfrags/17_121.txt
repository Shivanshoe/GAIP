hi everyone and welcome back to dying light 2. today i thought i'd spice things up and we will continue where we left off yesterday on the main story quest but as we can see here we're joined in co-op by the charming and infinitely likable tommy graphic that's very nice you to say jack yeah we have some fun today weren't we so you've played this in co-op already quite a bit right yeah i'm not too far ahead but you've done a few more story missions than i have yeah maybe one or two so i've got a bit of a cheat code going on here today then but it looks like well like i said stodd's been skipping through all of the uh the dialogue so i can't really remember what missions we've done and what we haven't as far as you're concerned there is no story though there is no story in this game right that's cool um also guys i have to say a big thank you to nvidia who are sponsoring this one again today we are playing in 4k 60fps so the game should look real nice on the stream and the video dying light 2 is a big game for nvidia on pc and we've got like ray tracing illumination and we've also got dlss and as we did yesterday i'm just going to show you guys a bit of a demonstration if you look in the top right hand corner you can see my frame rate up there and i've locked it to 60 but if i go into the options menu here and we're going to turn dlss off no upscaling i'm going to go back to the game and look at the frame rate and you can probably see straight away i mean we're down to 34 there at native 4k so it's not the smoothest experience but i'm gonna go ahead and enable that again whack that bad boy on there and basically dlss uses ai to boost your performance in the game while keeping the graphics looking real good and also as i mentioned we do have some advanced ray tracing options going on here we're using dx12 ray tracing we've got some lovely soft shadows so they look great with the foliage and the trees we've also got ambient occlusion which means all the light in the scene just looks natural and correct and the big one here is the ray traced global illumination and that kind of like realistically bounces light around the world and when you have this off compared to on it's a huge difference you turn it on and everything just looks a lot more natural and it just kind of fits in the scene better so a big thanks again to nvidia for sponsoring today there is a link down in the description below which will go to pc specialists they're the guys who built the pc that i'm playing on and they've got rtx builds and systems available right away so with that said let's get into it if you enjoy the stream in the video leave a like and tom we're gonna jump off this roof and head in this direction okay [Music] i think hang on yeah i've completely messed that up and ruined everything so we've both landed as close to the ground as we can be yeah can you see the story man there's a military base i can yeah um i presume you know where i mean it's 260 meters away who's going for it we'll find it there we go we've got a uh event here have you upgraded your glider no not yet and you've got to go to a craft master somewhere but i've figured out okay don't we need to go this way tom i think we need to go through the buildings it's oh my god there's someone hanging here i'll find my way i'm gonna go this way it's more it's more to the right isn't it um well my yellow thing is over here on the left on i don't know what to tell you so i don't see your thing maybe not oh my goodness also guys i did find a purple bow and arrow if you joined the stream yesterday you'll remember that i did get a bow and arrow right at the end so we're going to test that out and see if it's any good toy you're a night runner me night runner where are you son are you up there tarzan overreally oh i missed the rope forget it can you come down your objective's there it's over here time yeah oh my god why are you jumping around like you're bunny hopping i'm gliding yeah i don't think your objective mark is showing for me i think okay mine's on something else maybe because you're like further ahead in the story i've just got to go in here i think yeah yeah speak to these lads township is it um that's that's a building jacket i'm gonna knock on the door are we going in does this drag you in then or do you have to come in manually uh what do you mean are you watching a cut scene now or are you just like yeah i'm watching yeah just as soon as you start it starts for me see any signs of renegades around here no see private now calm down and let aglot think what's there to think about why not head back nice hearing tom who the heck are you anyway someone offering to help i'll check what happened to the power know anything else about it that's top secret military information we're trying to figure out how to get up there just go ahead and tell them everything why don't you every last detail what's the big secret huh we need to get this piece of [ __ ] working my colleagues vastly oversimplifying things but his just is correct there are obvious signs of the electricity having returned and this here appears to be a substation i like his bandanas and others like it are capable sounds like sully from monsters we have orders functioning what's his face meaning back on unfortunately without climbing equipment access to it is severely limited climbing well we can get over there call me something i can climb up there without yeah i'll just pretend i don't know the way i'm willing to do that okay you'd be doing a great favor what'd you mean what was that he said i think it was something about his mother we have to find these things these guys yeah these guys are on something man why do they sound like they're from mad max you know what i'm gonna hit him up with the shock arrow straight away this will be my first dude i don't know if it like put chains to other enemies [Music] i feel like this is our pizza why they oh you've actually killed him there's no way he survives this tom jack what have you done another one what are you going in there like a medieval night for because i'm a medieval night is that it did we win yes dying night bro we just headboarded you i just decapitated him dying night that was too quick man you're too too short i'm witty right yeah so when you walk up to something i have to press f on it as well so like you have to everything for the first time i have to f the same thing as uf i always get the slop anyway yes what about you bud i'm pretty sure i just killed him like that name's aiden hey you guys know this one what do the bullets say to the man that got shot uh just passing through just pass him through yeah that was an exit wound your friend wasn't so lucky well we just teleported yeah lately they've been sending them fresh out of a real shortened boot camp or without any at all recruits cannon fodder and central command's eyes that's enough nataf watch your words nitaf that's a good name of course is it so how about it bud you still want it it's fat in backwards not for free of course it is that good nameless that guy's name is tolga backwards if you need any help up there give us a holler over the radio aglot's good electronics however from here i can estimate the level of damage done to the apparatus emotional damage we've got to get there tom inside the building yeah well at least it's not a windmill fast travel oh where i wonder where we go yes i'm just gonna go up here i'm gonna go on this i guess tom you've nailed it first time dude how did you know i'm just gonna go over here and then jump off this yellow box thing and onto this and then round that mitten over here and then through that on that pipe and turn around 360. why why ladder store get around that corner tom oh there's a pipe a yellow pipe above you yep there you are get around the other side jump over there one more i mean there's no animation tom you're just literally isn't it sliding around all right we're in i'm inside how's it look somebody was in a big hurry when they took it offline i would surmise the main circuit suffered a break oh no and connect the source of power to the transmitter we need a cable tower yes we do so our objective here is there's electrical stations electrical stations is the word i'm looking for you need to repair broken connections between its generators i first find a working generator connected to one of the broken ones all right well there's a green one down there tom isn't there number one you know you'll find the generator that has number one in it which is conveniently this one here top of the substation trying to connect power to the transfer oh the cable's got length as well it does yeah you might need to parkour you're just out of reach sure you're gonna make it it's a come with us you couldn't get it it's a puzzle themselves it is i'm graphing which one i like there you go i didn't know we were going to be electricians yeah it did look a bit pole dancer actually we got to fix the lights jack yeah right so the next one looks like it's is it number two thomas yeah we've got these stairs i'll tell you what though when i loop stuff do you get it as well or is it no i know i can loot the same stuff you loot but my loot will be different to your loot okay and you're [ __ ] around over there okay the competition huh number two it was quite stripper you know where is number two is it above us around here maybe there they're there it's on this far side do i have enough length thomas we'll find out won't we oh do you know what if i see a parkour through that door yeah yeah swing over to this platform ready i've nailed that that's enough length that's plenty of length there tom oh did you have a bit of slack as well after that there was a bit of slack and a bit of length okay at the same time feels good to drop down here now i think down this elevator shaft and the last one should be in here there's also if we come through this vent this is oh thomas i do not like how that looks have you seen that what look at this look there's no problem jack it's like gollum or something that's why jack no that's not right is it into the vent come on jack chat do people look like this in venice this way you actually look like gollum come on jack into my fence the cow's on this better be something good is it something good it's uh it's a little little i'm inside of you there tom yeah so i like it keep going does mission progress stay for both host and whoever join so the progress stays for the host liam but we look this up if you've got you saved the xp basically so any things that you do to your character are saved but the the story progress is not correct so i can keep all of my weapons and gear but if i resume my story it'll be wherever i left off yeah right so grab the grab the cable and then let's back up through this and then jump and turn around he's a big cable this one's on it makes sense in a way because it's an rpg game and you could just manipulate again luke from your friend's servers so i don't know if that's something they considered or it's just like they didn't have the tech all right plugged immediately this game now i'm in coal it's okay added like 50 fun i was enjoying it anyway but the fact that we're doing it in co-op is just amazing it's just my presence right electrical traps you should be able to oh yeah i g i gave it to survivors before yeah i probably do peacekeepers for the city just because there's so many more cars and stuff about and you get auto yeah you can auto crossbow at one point look you can see all the perks on the bottom okay okay here we go why is there a naked man holding the world i don't see that where uh he was at the bottom of the screen have i got my mod on again sorry oh you've installed the new mod nude mod [Music] why did we just teleport to the top there was an inhibitor case there john we've just missed not bad it's fine we have to go back in no right optimal even here's your pay that's per hour thanks sully working with you has been a pleasure aidan you take care of yourselves and take care of yourselves i got the coolest voice in the world look at that man over there you can be rich too you see where oh yeah borrow money for investing all right i'm going back in you're actually going to go back in yes it's an inhibitor might be a lot easier jack you just glitch your way down i just parked all my way down like face the wall and just kept grabbing stuff no good shot on this so do we both get that yeah we'll just have to like i got leather guards there whereas i think you probably got something different to clear my inventory increased stamina or health i've done three three i feel like that's good i prefer stamina but yeah i'm gonna do a health this one this one i'm level five and level four nice aren't the pk's fascists said jake peden i don't know if they're fascists it's a bit ambiguous i would say so far what's happening to my character you s you i just uh i got my stamina to level six and my guy just freaked out like it was like he wasn't getting infected again what what you don't see me shaking like that no you can't okay it's not that this is me shaking a lot i'm not like they've tongue down the shaking okay [Music] uh all right let's move on yeah nice window 3400 meters tom oh we should have used our things off the roof our gliders well we can get many rooms in this game tom i can there's a vent over there there's like areas where you can boost like really high into the sky they don't seem to care about you sometimes it's not working you jump and then press it you get it yeah you can glide onto that one there there's gotta be a lift though somewhere a lift yeah usually there's a lift onto these buildings oh do you mean a uh a hook yeah one of the hooks that you can just go zip so how many health bars have you got i've got two full ones interesting interesting that's a thing here jack grd it's the grd chipmunks on the mic you're good at picking locks yeah i know you would be oh my god okay this weapon is nuts check these shelves too because it should be a legendary weapon oh oh that's the axe is that the one that you're using see i knew it that was very lucky go on then how would you find the spot easy peasy i love that so what did you get like the battle axe that i have yeah yeah i think it's the same one hold on let me just check i presume is it purple uh mine was legendary mine's yeah gold oh [ __ ] yeah boy did you put mods on it uh i kind of save ice i only put my i don't put mods on straight away you want to wait until you get like a purple or something well no just because of the durability thing boosts it back up doesn't it yeah so like if i put one on straight away then i don't think it it just stays at the level it is it doesn't add any more i don't think yeah or does it no i think you can you can every time you mod it it puts the durability back to 100 doesn't it well it increases it by a certain amount it won't always be max okay but yeah like if i pick something up for the first time it's got 210 durability if i then add a mod it doesn't increase the durability anymore so i tend to use it until i've got maybe i've used 50 of the durability points and then i'll mod it for the first time just so i can increase the length of the weapons life otherwise because you can't keep your weapon forever activate cartridge okay back away it's going to blow up you're kidding no those containers are next to itself god damn okay that's nice yeah so that's what the peacekeepers have kicked what the hell did you do that got dropped oh he did the spike stomp how did you what's the burn command for that when you unlock it uh so you jump then double tap b v e you should be able to get it it's pretty that's actually called it's called dropkick it's on the right side yeah i've not got it yet imagine that second middle hit up some of the others yeah maybe just don't give them all to the peacekeepers that's the wrong side isn't it drop kick yeah i'll get it next definitely i'll make sure it's my next one just because it's fun um okay over here tom let's go right to the left okay yeah up here i like that super jump as well slide either no i don't have slider when you do the shift jump you know and you can just go away further uh yeah the the speedy vault oh my god you're mad that's fine you're next to a big lad there yeah ignore that sweet weapon you got there aidan is it new sweet weapon you got there aiden is it new oh here we go it's a hook that's where we need to be here yeah just over here oh i see the objective marker now fish eye canteen danny are we gonna meet rosario again indeed do i need to press f on this one as well yeah got why is he pointing in there he's going to fight with a wall he's drunk tom we this is a bar and we know that because it's a bar it says bar there on the wall you see it yeah [Music] where's where's the soaker where is she i want to see her again she's not here i guess i'll look around we've got to find the one okay let's go and ask the bartender instead of everyone else in this room all players good who's that stop the difference this is what happens after the apocalypse oh really like what yeah i don't know who that is i haven't heard a thing about you at all so we have to see frank sassy wrestle chibi jackass what the hell he just spoke about jabba solo says refuse i mean reach for the show yeah go on i'll take it what is it it looks like uh tomato juice you know when you said it before we started like can you can she's got like a really cool like cut on the back of her head good oh the bees oh where'd she go oh she's always how did you get there so fast i think she can teleport it's all the way by that door every time i yesterday every time that i went out of the door she just shot it on my face yeah i know it it was very annoying running through the subway and she keeps shutting doors behind you yeah i'm trying to effort as well this is broken waiting for other players to proceed i've pressed f oh yeah there we go are we going i pressed p to fast travel to you and it seemed to fix it you see these people wilson this is not based on a true story at each other's throats i don't know where you got that info from i thought it was historical actually stay calm cool and collected because of frank they respect him because he was a night runner everyone here owes him something including me if it wasn't for frank i wouldn't be here and where would you be in a dark zone as a fighter or in some den high and about to get higher frank will help us you can rely on him too trust me ready let's go okay it's frank a bunny rabbit oh no disappointed it's frank a bunny rabbit yeah from danny darker frank it's me he literally just said rabbits as well how weird is he has a gre access key waltz used it to turn on the electricity in town working gre key lighting looks really good here sure about those plates that were made for the queen's jubilee and they had to bring them all back in where did you get it no they actually mispronounced jubilee and put jubbly on all of the plates god we think this contains data proving what they did to us in the hospital so you still believe you'll find out why walt's [ __ ] up your childhood okay i'll tell you ready yeah because he's a [ __ ] psycho he's [ __ ] in the head this guy's very drunk tonight holy grail and ark of the covenant happy hayden right you and luang can get the [ __ ] out of my face now i got more important things in my he's a drunk beat him up beat up yeah just beat him up come on you would have [ __ ] up you should be off every drink you see jeffy yeah you were right what should i do son uh well it's not the yellow one moves the story forward and the right one is just more questions isn't it so yeah but that seemed like a choice the way they presented it there yeah the yellow ones are highlighted when it actually makes a for the first time difference years and i doubt he did that out of the kindness of his heart i understand how much law you want frank get your [ __ ] together you were a legend [ __ ] commander of the night runners do you even remember that frankie look at his beard he's got little ponytails in his beard tv station she's carried this story for me so far like her acting is so good i think she's written the best as well though yeah but if you're looking for the gre database you need to find a terminal to access it the thing is i have no idea where one could be and those whom you are probably long dead but the good news is we'll probably be that ourselves soon enough i'm just here doesn't care anymore does it no get the [ __ ] out of my quarters [ __ ] drunkard disgraceful oh she's knocking one back i don't think you can give advice like that and then just take a chunk in it will you check i'm right behind you i said i committed it i'm really drunk i can't do anything renegades are in the central loop i repeat renegades are in the center they're surrounding the fisheye can anyone hear me over [Applause] what the hell we've got a big fighter answer tom yes we do i know i'm going to open up another electric what are you doing all i can see is you just getting across the level i drop kicking everyone so stupid man i need to get that ability whoa thomas i love it oh that building exploded why southwest because they're firing cannons to the east take it down to the east to the east where's the east this way it's canon's thumb this way oh no that's way too far down tom oh i just grabbed that i i think we have to go and then jump onto okay there's a rappel down here we'll see who's faster you're probably faster dude it looks so funny you just like eating across the level [Music] try and find this zip you saw jack oh yeah get them off the cannon if you can find them yeah they're outfit we're gonna use this axe all right sabotage diffusing diffusing i'm sticking it i'm sticking it ninja defuse do i actually read the comments in the chat adam yes i do this is a live stream isn't it tomographic yes jack this is a live stream tommy isn't even here it's just a bot now what gotta go back eliminate the renegades on the lower floor renegade i can't believe i actually pulled that off he's land you're my main man yeah good job and you can play this with four people oh he's got a spear yeah this one's got a big spear i thought it was you that trump kicked me then [ __ ] behind me oh my god i love it the drone kicks so pee on these moves as well can you just kick people off the roof eat them off the edge okay uh disable a second rooftop cannon go go go got two minutes go go go go move it move ahead is the sky okay can i hold on to this spear as well as i go don't think so this guy just kick him off tom hang on we do have a timer remember come on drop kick he's dodging me now can i just spear him there we go oh come in did you wall run this yeah ow [Music] oh my god jack let's go behind you as well to walk off the edge oh the another one hold on what's that that looks like an axe as well i just got so high off that yeah it's a big boy that one isn't it there's a vent below you yeah i'm to land on top of this i did land on top of that on the billboard i got a hilltop okay healing i need to like improve it what do you mean the healing speed have you not got any med kids no i do but it just takes a while yeah the no the actual like med kits like you inject yourself and get full health oh no is that a thing why do they sound like that song i don't know so many bodies on the ground that you drop kicks all right so that we did it the last one stuff in air is there yeah oh is there more of it we've got to go back the golimaning [Music] jump if you need to you can jump whilst you're gliding you can grab something coming up 20 seconds nice yeah we got time good job nice that was a great combo up on the roof there tom the one two dropkick yeah like you drop kicked him and i like jumped off the top and like kicked him in the head yeah but in the eye socket though not through the mask who's this the bartender no jack ma check who needs help and bring in some medics he's got two first names of those [ __ ] renegades you if it weren't for you a lot more would be dead moving fast now tom the story i like this sir i have a question we're looking for a gre database most gre equipment has been dead ace is picking up a bit you know what do you need this database for yeah i think it probably opens up more in the city with your knowledge of the city you know gre places inside out aidan and i need to find this database will you help us loan he's your friend aiden you could say that i've never heard of you aiden where are you from where am i from i'm telling the truth why lie i came from outside the walls so you've seen a lot you probably came through velador too right yeah i did all right what do you want to know a lot has been going on there lately we lost our commander and the bizarre has tried to cut off our power source they say most of our people have been killed either by the infected or by those from the bazaar i also lost contact with the new commander aytor in his unit know anything about them do this is mo capped or hand animated um i think it's a mix i think most things are hand animated but there is some more rosario's probably all mocap and some of the random so just do the car plan hand animated decimated squad i barely managed to escape i shouldn't have left them like this we need to find out what's going on there future commander as for the gre equipment you're asking about you can ask lieutenant ro if something's working he'll know about it lately he and his unit have been securing the culvert islands and new dawn park areas but because of the butcher's raid we had to go radio silent so you have to look for him yourselves if you find him give him what is it what are they orders for him and the other units can they not use like a radio or anything do you have the dsm come outside it's probably you know like when they use pigeons back in the day but there was a radio in the game wasn't it at the start you have to pick the right frequency yeah but anyone can tune into the frequency they probably want to keep them yeah all right so this is about as much as i play jack so it's all needs me now walking stick as a weapon okay cool um this is a is there a trader here oh hang on let me um let me drop you some med kits so you've got ones that you just sticking yourself yeah yeah it's just a syringe yeah it's five on the ground military med kit so i'll heal you to full every time might as well try it i've literally never had that tom well they the store i know sell them you can get them in the like boxes the inhibitors are created crates and stuff oh it's a really quick heal as well super fast like you do when he's running around um down here oh my head oh teleport players there we go that's cool yeah only you can do that i can't where did you learn to fight like that where on the road as a pilgrim i had no other choice on the road don't you wonder sometimes what they gave us to make us like this stronger rather [ __ ] in the head but yeah [ __ ] up and stronger maybe i'll figure that out when i find mia what's next well you heard it yourself row might know where you can access that damn database here take these orders to him just don't lose him or jack will gut me what about you i'll join you but first i have to see frank you saw him he's barely holding it together yeah sorry jack uh i am yeah i've capped it 4k 16 because if i don't cap it then i get tearing on the capture card because it will only do 4k 60. makes sense yeah i mean it can do more fps but like i don't want you guys to see screen tearing so okay good apparently i already had uh 12 of those in my inventory i just didn't realize you have more than me you should know that didn't you hear what jack was saying take it easy nobody has contact with old villadora here and even if they're necklaces it's like they're by that time black dolly you're in spiderman yeah that's what we're looking for and stay on the radio all the time your thing partner your thing partner cringe cringe didn't ask ratio plus l fell off fell off didn't play parachute okay cool how do i drop you some of these button then so yeah go in your options oh you're like inventorying and then you'll see like drop and then you select how many if i drive you five yeah take them how many do you have now i have six okay well i have eight so take one back fine thomas god see if i can assist that's a mushroom i mean that's what he gave me right no yeah we gotta go this way now you ready jumping off are we you fell off ratio time it's night time oh i pulled pulled mine so late do you want to sleep or don't want to sleep it's more fun in the dark tom i i don't mind it i just think you know youtube quality wise i've got the flashlight though on it yeah they can see well inside a circle tom 40 000 bitrate right it doesn't matter though all right all right i don't like swimming good for them what's the swimming animation like that's all right there's no sprint there is there so you all might always at max speed a front crawl would be nice it's a bit it's kind of odd okay but it's not bad you know might just be because i look weird you don't look weird tom my glasses are a bit weird aren't they no they're not they're quite fashionable they look like snowboarding goggles you know that kind of yeah go nice oh yeah it's a uv light area lovely bit of immunity what's f this guy jack left him got a nice man bun i have orders from the commander i ain't row he went off of the squad to new dawn park good highlight great guess i gotta keep going what are you talking about show me those orders son i was supposed to give them directly to roe and i'm wrong when rose not here it's called chain of command give them give what the hell did the commander say why we're being pulled back to center he didn't seem too eager to explain anything to me i'm just the messenger hmm okay boys time to pack it in commands ordered us to withdraw it's back to base for us we're doing what we're leaving this outpost don't question me you can't hide behind myers skirt out here you're you're abandoning us what do we do we'll be defenseless go arm the survivors then we roll if i were you i'd give them plenty of weapons the renegade sent a whole attachment to the fisheye any other bright ideas civilian that's just a question where can i find ro new don park like i said not sure if they made it yet you take these to them and tell them i'm on it better you than me buddy rose's gonna blow his top when he reads these and i'm here to save lives not lose mine yeah thanks for the tip [ __ ] we won't stand a chance get your men in order i'm really sorry civilian but we have orders civilian i don't care about your name i know we've lived together for four years but i don't really care anything about you to be honest all right let's let's sleep then there's a room for me in your there's always room for you in my bag top the fastest night sleep i've ever had jack zip i wish i could fall asleep that easily in real life yeah and wake up that quick oh you just what the zip line uh rope yeah no it is but it goes a bit janky doesn't it shows the rope in my hands but it doesn't like apparently ro went there i tried to jump on it after you jumped on it and it went nope this isn't here anymore sorry oh damn you can hold on to the ivy there no [ __ ] clue what's going on really yeah well like a ladder it was just some ivy on the wall and i just like grabbed onto it butcher tell me more about him he's the leader of the renegades he gave the order to douse the city and chemicals that's when my parents died i'm sorry i'm not saw my dad once in my whole life once and if mom was good at anything i was drinking i almost died i think i've died can i get you oh i'm good i'm good look at your health tom yeah what happened what health i uh you know when you like grab a ledge but you don't have the momentum to pull yourself up oh yeah you lose stamina so i like yeah i dropped and fell no i just remember the hospital i felt pain in the fire ratio right before they split me and me up she's the only thing i do enjoy just parkouring it's just fun when you start the game you don't really have much but then you get the skills this is just your entire game is this all you do you dodge it they do dodge it when i'm close to a roof i will always do it because it's just an insta kill yeah no matter what the level of the enemy right yeah you just smash them you can kick off the big bosses and everything leave me alone please mateo for lieutenant rowe you seen him who are you what are you doing he's a

just run back to base on your own go there and don't let that [Music] it's cool as well when you're all investing in like different skills as you progress like everyone's just showing off that new thing unlocked yeah i've located row a hotel by the new walls drive and variant intersection congrats one big thing before the meeting with rome he's got a [ __ ] hair trigger temper yeah grady

a big mad tongue he literally just didn't care come on get him off get him off get him off eat he's gone yeah he's definitely dead after that that is embarrassing that is embarrassing i've untied these guys it's actually the most op thing because you just take on enemies with so much help tommy's not really like yeah this would just go down now yeah he died on the bridge you sure is that the same right the only the only downside is that you can't loot the people you've obviously kicked off yeah this is a new guy go on get him oh he's so close just get off mate bye bye have a wonderful time those two guards can't believe what they've just seen how can a man drop kick so hard apparently some someone in my chat is saying that they remember doing that a lot in the first game drop kicks yeah apparently it's the message this drop kick slow down you took them out who are you i got orders from jack matt well [ __ ] me let's look at what santa's elsa brooks i recognize this guy so this is the first guy we tried yeah i met him before you've met this guy yeah i've already met him you sure he's not man i lost to secure this miserable plot of land look i don't lieutenant i'm getting confused with the other guy five of our very best the british dude has killed more virals than an entire unit sierra and little ron not a little wrong it's all right at my side since before the flight no little run thank goodness and now what i'm supposed to pull back down i'm looking for access to the gre database i hear you know where i can do that yeah i do but why the [ __ ] would i tell you under the circumstances reckon his surname is idiotic business to attend to it might be get out of my sight okay gentlemen gather the dog for the fallen gently down the streams merrily merrily merrily merrily dropkick in the face you come to piss me off too you know me ro aiden and me both are looking for that gre database and you're gonna tell us you want to drag this out or take care of it here and now [ __ ] why are you after the database i've heard it was stored on servers in the observatory command center but that building was destroyed in the chemical attacks years ago the bombings came one after the other like we were the [ __ ] viet cong nothing was left understand nada he's got the biggest jaw i've ever seen gentlemen i think maybe he's the same voice actor the guy we spoke to outside of the that place where we plugged in all the electric cables maybe that's why he seems similar yeah there's an inhibitor case behind us you saw it cheeky oh look at that snap a little come on there you go some military make it there hot snuffling oh yeah yeah i love that so many dead people yeah they all got dropkicked did i get anything cool 36 damage hello i mean i've got like a gun it's a gun melee weapon have you ever seen that it's called the gun hammer no yeah i've got the gun hammer does it shoot no it doesn't shoot but it's just like hold on let me see no no not that i know what is that look it's it's got a gun on top so it's like a bludgeon but you hit him with the pistol yeah bang i mean it would do some damage like you know it's hard to forge metal so they probably use what we can well the screamer uh i can upgrade my parkour again what should i get parkour get the parkour thumb that's what i'm doing yeah but get the other parkour right get the one that says parkour right and then get the one that says parkour right got it got it okay i'm good i'm happy teleport no i thought i could bank you out your menu or something it didn't come over it didn't work i'll upgrade afterwards what's next next didn't you hear you get a boo stick later on in the game what so much for discovering the mystery of our childhood i'll go back to looking for the shits on my hit list and you you're gonna enjoy your life in the center like a big shotgun you like the one showdown i'm going to the observatory at the end of it oh the um bomb lance all good things come to an end that's what i'm thinking the butcher and the pricks from my list they'll find this out soon enough i'm going back to looking for them you shouldn't stay here either aiden i'm sorry you didn't find yourself we will find mia i believe thanks you've always got waltz he probably knows what time her name is uh mia wherever you are i'll let you know good luck gotcha take care everyone i wanna go out

parkour one and i've just spent it on now maybe my menu didn't have data i bought headstomp hedge stomp yeah so if an enemy is on the ground i can perform an assassination and just stomp their heads i must kill myself there some i need to get better at pulling that thing immediately like said it's such an awkward key to it on my phone got a keyboard as well so it's like different layout almost it's really cool that we can fly around now though oh yeah it's great for the sea uh calf thank you for the 20 months man that's very kind you hope you will i'm good thanks man i'm enjoying this you know it's uh it's great to have tomorrow here as well killing zombies with friends killing zombies you float too how far away is this 380 meters okay there's a dog there son a dog a dog oh i thought you meant like a like an actual dog in the game no dog okay yeah zombie dog wasn't no enemies zombie dog would be horrifying yeah it would i mean it's not not too far fetched we've seen him before well you've baited these zombies now jack and i'm landing in the pile that you've made are you okay i heard the place you're looking for was destroyed look at this this is cool thanks but sorry isn't much consolation oh i missed that me too you can climb up it again when you're in the water what's that ticking noise do you hear that doesn't it underwater no is that the first time so i've got to pick the lock really fast before i drown go on you can do it it's easy i did it i did it i did it gg i'll play uh no it just opened oh yeah you don't need to pick a lock that's the first time i've seen that though what the hell's going on in my hand yeah you're trying to do the inhibitor animation you'll do it when you get out of the water if you haven't there's a higher oh there's lots of devs isn't there yeah all over hey val kaff thank you for the 10 zombie dog liking the resident evil movie if any of you guys seen the new resident evil movie because i saw that you could purchase it on vod now and i was like i haven't really heard anything about this so i assume it's terrible [Music] i think that's a fair assumption to make when you don't hear anything about our movie tom and their minds here it says danger minefield you just run straight past the sign i mean i'm scanning i don't see any does that work though you think it would while this game is co-op yeah jamal you can play with three other people four in total which version is the game on pc yeah we're playing on pc i'm i'm the host in the horse oh i haven't even tested that yet how did you do it you have to space double e oh sick i'm gonna have so much fun with that that's great i've got to f this boards on good effort did i move it for you straight away i thought we just i thought that was just like a cutscene that started playing now it's doing it for both of us yes it's terrible lots of fan service but overall not bad movie it's absolute crap worth a watch only ruins left it's good not worth a buy okay so just a rental there maybe i believe this looks dangerous there's a lot of yellow stuff yeah chemical stuff in here don't touch that you said maybe you could help me out i'd like to ask how no over oh no you've touched it oh i'm probably just turning again have we gone zombie mode that sounded weird it makes the mila yucovich films look like masterpieces to be honest the only resident evil film i've seen is the first one and i watched that when i was like 15 and when i was 15 it was a good movie you watch it nowadays it's terrible but it's got some memorable moments in it let's get the hell out of here hey wait stay away greg hey it's greg wallace where where how'd they take us we're just on some random room what just happened here oh we killed them all did we yeah it's interesting that i mean that's a bit i guess we've got to travel again you see that jumped on how is that possible i went from that roof where we were to this one oh i jumped off with the glider he's beginning to believe he's beginning to believe have you seen the new matrix no jack i haven't you know heard some uh about things i didn't want to ruin the rest of the movies from us also uh yeah i rented it the other night on vod and um not great shame just didn't have the same gritty feel as the original movie i like the original film the first one right well i mean that's kind of explained within the story i don't want to spoil it but there's a lot of like meta in it um and the trailers like they're a bit misleading in what the actual story of the movie is right probably intentional yeah i mean it was a bit of a surprise when i watched it but like the first matrix movie i could watch that until i die yeah but like i've got no intention of ever watching the new one ever again gotcha so far like a cash grab in certain elements yeah boomstick where i've just bought the blueprint for it from this from this uh they've got it here yeah the blueprint oh baby yeah i got it there you go exploding arrows and oh exploding arrows hello do you have that yeah just got those i can't sell my wares to her though why not there's no cell like she doesn't bother is there any trading no there might be a trader somewhere else [Music] no oh yeah no maybe inside yeah there is half this guy show him i thought this was ro report to meyer in dispatch the commander was all the way back little man ponytails thanks it's the mandatory haircut here right this is the way [Music] enter the matrix yeah that was a great game zero i used to love playing that [Music] that was a bit dramatic just the point take care of the uv lights it should be on point fast and easy go go go did you kill hakkon or save him saved him i killed him oh no he betrayed us if you could intervene why'd you leave in the first place this is [ __ ] wasn't your father some famous war hero i bet he's rolling over in his grave watch your mouth civilian things are tough all over you know that he's a south african tom i haven't had one of these i lived yet enough to see the electricity turned back on nah you i remember you from the canteen oh maybe not yes did her accident just change in the canteen uh maybe don't sweat it there's like a southern woman earlier in the game that had a really weird like it sounded like oh yeah i know the one you mean yeah commander told me to brief you about faction between texan and welcomes you yeah like when you come out of the sewers for the first time where is me after you get bitten he came across a lead in old villadore you gotta wait see that board i got plenty that needs doing and not enough men you want to pick up some of our slack we pay she's really pulling off the wet look yeah that looks good something's happened it's not the way it's bleeding out what his name killed him nano waltz yeah christopher we lost too many people in old villadore i mean he's that's literally in her tongue his hand his weapon went inside her right [Music] it's normal um where's the trader then this way talk to jack matt yeah i'll do the trade stuff first i've got a load of stuff to sell menu hot potato potato other ass four thousand coin time i've got to sell let's go oh there's mines here diy grenades that's new you've got a load of stuff that you're doing way earlier in the game oh okay unless you just like haven't been reading the stuff you've been getting there's a golden bow here what yeah got golden birds on why do you have all the bows i don't know i haven't seen one yet um i did actually fight a boss as well right whose accent changed like in the cutscene he was um like kind of eastern european accent and then when i fought him he was uh south america like southern american and i was like oh good it's very peculiar you know yeah maybe the the dialogue is just universal for the actual people you fight i've got gold sneakers there i didn't even realize so many weapons that i need to sell have you got a lot of stuff to sell oh yeah getting through it what's my bow 48 damage ah the golden one i wish i could select the type of rarity i want to get rid of yeah that'd be good walking stick terrible i mean it's going to get to the point where i can just buy whatever i want because i've got so much cash well yeah if this if the sellers sell it you know it changes 53 i mean why not and i've got loads of money might as well buy it might as well buy a golden yacht how about 10 golden yolks mines i'm mine by this all hands on i think i can upgrade stamin yeah i'll do stamina i'm such a hoarder in games like this unique i've crafted a boom stick as well tom okay i need to do that boomstick unique ranged weapon yeah self-made gun created from scrap it's not very durable so save it for special occasions has it got two shots interesting that's cool where is it is it like a accessory yeah yeah it's not a primary weapon nice because i said guns won't be in this game so i mean it takes a lot of scrap to make so i'll have to start picking out and i only thought that was useful for making log pics is this somewhere i can upgrade health outside my chat saying i don't know where you would do that though do you mean get health back but you've no no i've got i've got plenty of health i'm full you can you can go to wells and stuff and drink water to get health no someone said go speak to the trader outside and keep some comments of great health with the vendor outside you know then we know that means that sounds like a lie unless they mean medicaids and stuff yeah maybe you can craft like you can upgrade your knives like throwing knives and maybe you can upgrade med kits i don't know yeah you can maybe that's what they're saying if my medicare takes me to 100 health anyway then what's the point yeah it's a waste yeah okay don't just stand there because i ran back to the run back to the chick he does the uh i just travel to you i can't see any mad stuff he's sick is that it is a gun zero yeah know what this is these brass knuckles belonged first to commander lucas then they look ridiculous okay but over the radio you said you have information for me yes but before we get down to that i've had one game breaking bug ajb i got stuck under a table that's all that's the only bug i've had uh sister i'm looking for my sister i feel like that's the main question yeah people seem to have like a flawless experience with this game or they have all of the problems yeah i want him to tell me where she is there's some rumors that you can get like a corrupted save as well that's the butcher's right-hand man he pumps his men full of inhibitors juices them up we can get them both come on baby i brought you here because i know that a few gre scientists are hiding out in the city we picked up the trail of one of them right before the renegade attack sounds promising when i find a scientist we'll see what they know if they're of no use we'll find another and another until you get the answers you're looking for cheers mate what do you want to return fine he just wants to mount you i think in a packet of monster munch maybe the same thing both of us want the city has electricity again the renegades are on the attack for the first time no it doesn't have as much sugar in it but new possibilities have opened up for us as well thanks to the electricity we can fire up the biggest antenna in the city in the us it does on the vnc yeah the signal will let me reach a larger number of people communication between settlements will be improved we'll enlist more recruits and defend the city and then it will be easier to find the surviving gre doctors you need well then i'll help you okay i'm in okay you're on the end the butcher account for a away you all right sir maya will share our plans two minutes apart go see her as soon as you can oh and aidan you don't have to call me sir to friends i'm jack okay there was already a character called jack in the game wasn't there so i find it kind of weird that there's just another main character and i'm called jack as well it's just really confusing so you're called jack and he's called jack matt do you think he's got a brother called matt jack tom i bet he has i bet he has let's crack on joey let's crack on jack cracker jack can't one jump it's a parkour game one out of ten uninstalled it's a shame should be able to go third person in these areas would be cool yeah like in far cry 6 matt told me to see you yes he wanted me to give you this just to actually see your character's outfit stuff for helping us peacekeepers a uv flashlight good coming oh babies he said something about a plan the v the guy's head is inside my head now that the lights are on we can use the tv antenna to broadcast our call i can see his nose but first we need to get to that it's just a giant nose on my screen it keeps leaning into my camera oh there it is is he trying to kiss what's he want it's the tallest building oh he's in me now it was such a symbol of the city's greatness a symbol of its fall how do you say that that antenna could bring the city together once more but anyone who goes up there trying to fire it up guess what happens nothing good i bet damn right we're hoping it'll be different this time we're gonna light it up with uv lamps cool that's gonna be really handy let's get going are the lights in place they would be if juan from supplies would just do his job for once god damn i'll take it that he didn't do his job he's been playing this guy's licking my face and he's late come on show me the nose again show me the nose oh yeah come on give me the nose put the nose in him see the block heads on his nose yeah it's quite detailed rtx it needs some clearance though i've not seen a clearance but we don't play the game at nighttime so i don't know what to tell you it allows you to return weak and all infected especially virals and volatiles equipped with one and then hold it to use it keep an eye on the flashlight's power oh okay it's got a recharge on it yeah that's good and then you can like oh you can stun them and put them to the ground and then drop kick them yes please we just had do we just have it or we have to craft it uh i think we should just have it right they wouldn't just debate you like that would they it looked like a blueprint to me decoy night runner tools boom you know you just yeah i see cool gather info this is gonna be a cool mission time i think i'm down we're gonna have to just get like massive uv lamps i've been using the uv bars they're pretty handy looking for juan rainer you don't appear to be on a schedule it's urgent the commander sent me so much sends you jacques jacques messier is not here i can't take a message no i need to talk to him in person where is he unfortunately i can't help me reyna's whereabouts are no one's business wait if he must hmm anything else that's not going i'm not sure this woman's actually french is not particularly concerned with the little mages feelings do come again i think maybe she is i don't know it's quite a hard accent to pull off that isn't it yeah not like any of the other pk's i've met that might be because they're not joining oh several children she eats a child 10 meters away from us this is a cool area it's just completely optional though are they yeah we'll change the title maybe more missions down there later i don't remember much about my uh gcc oral to be honest you did oral at school yeah you know you went to very different schools jack [Music] i think i just said i'd like a small rabbit i don't know why but i don't know why i said is that real is that right [Music] a little top hat it's a weird noise remote c4 tom it's making weird noises it's not though is it i didn't put my shoes on just sounds like me that was the duck do you like baby back ribs jack who doesn't smiley i want my baby bat baby back baby did you leave i'm downstairs i found like a i thought there was maybe maybe there was a fast travel location down here but it's not yeah i can run now have you used fast travel yet nope there's an underground area where there's a bed and stuff there you guys like the metro stations as you can travel around fast travel is anybody there i'm going to die i'm going to die now please save me bye anyway glides off dog kicks himself off the roof oh i just dropped my first zombie man that felt good yes that felt good 40 minutes time [Music] we oh there's another one we can zoom onto the zoomies it's good that it fills your stamina back up yeah i want to [ __ ] like yeah i can if you like you can hit zombies with it like you just land on them that's so good that's way too good uh this way i guess just use an inhibitor and my character is stuck in an animation there we go ruined are you well zombies were just slapping me whilst i was like oh that's cool all right grab that the bar yeah it other animations not bad nice it's not bad eat guys it's just really fun just parkouring around yes reminds me of mirror's edge yeah i mean that's probably the last first person parkour game he played yeah i didn't play the original dying light did you yeah i played it twice oh damn the two play through these things started the same yeah pro dynamite player i did one co-op and then well i did single player first played it all the way through and then i think a buddy got it maybe a couple months later so i played it with him [Music] can you guys do dropkick pros now what do you want us to do just drop someone into you and then you kick someone into me i know who you are after that bang up with the renegades this guy's character model is like way better than anyone else's in the game like what's going on including vinnie here it's fine is it the lighting you interrupted our meal state your purpose in one store i think it's the lion yeah please it's just the rtx like face isn't it there's actually shadows you know perfectly well why i'm here yeah the global illumination is huge i don't know did you watch digital foundry's video where they compared everything and you think you will make an impression on me really good video super interesting i don't think themselves in terror but what can i expect he can't tell the difference between champagne and a crystal chalice or water from a dog's bowl oh no he hasn't announced a refinement isn't that right vinny i don't know don't be afraid machine gun kelly it's not like jack is gonna march in and have you hang ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ah vinny when will you grow a spine you want my we need to try this boom stick as well show me you deserve yeah but it says use it wisely and it costs a lot to make so i think we need to be really like use it wisely against a boss or something i quite like that they've taken guns out of the game the first time light like you you were just too overpowered when you got guns i don't doubt what kind of guns did it happen every kind shotguns pistols ars smashing the skulls of a few peasants doesn't mean everyone wants to lift you up on their back for this game though is that they got confiscated after the last city moved off everyone has their own desire their their own price sounds like john nicholson pitch just isn't working for me quite yet try again another jack try again threaten him no ask about listen i'm just trying to help i need those lamps so the groveling and begging begins my favorite part you really need him or jack would he promise you look you were supposed to deliver and i was asked to make sure you do and how do you expect to do that maybe bat your pretty eyelashes at me i'm not saying you're not my type because you are but i need a reason to break vinnie's heart for someone else so you have to try harder we have to threaten him okay you've used up all your time failed i mean what is it you think we have to threaten him from the get-go probably like they used to say he probably would have liked that you can't afford it maybe you fail everything i quite like him what's he saying come see me back at my place yeah i think you just have to fail right at least you have too much respect upon the world yes yes keep going they lose it that you buy it with much care believe me you are marvel uh marvel uh marvelously changed believe me you are marvelously changed now you i hold the world but i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one oh good very good now you graduate let me play the fool let me play the pool i think you definitely helped there tom yeah anyway i wanted to go and drop kick them but you can't in this area i know i wish you could kick everything in the game what's up game guard how are you doing we are going to use the boom everyone in my chat is like use the boomstick he scarfed down five questions fine a hot young woman at his side a young man but the rest is accurate he's a piece of work all right the dove's about i need him to get back jack needs uv lamps and juan's dragging his feet hmm that'll be tough juan barely listens to jack so he'll be an even tougher audience for you he has his own men and power base and he loves rubbing jack's nose in that and what can i do about that somebody who's going to say something else and someone he likes fine art antiques expensive [ __ ] from before the fall when he sees something that used to be valuable he can't stop himself zero self-control hmm all right where can i find something like that i heard of an old polish guy who lived in a penthouse by liberation passage they say he was an art collector or you can try his place right brian bedander there's a chance something's left welcome to my palace be so good what about you huh going on a hunt no a party it's daniel's birthday but you never know when a guest list will overlap with a hit list why don't you come and have a drink with us when you're done with one of his emperors he doesn't like anybody we'll be in touch now the devs are on the wall again they're all over the shop yeah swear that guy and his wife died in the first picture you pick up oh look it's antoine it's uh what's his name icon hack on yeah he's a real person though isn't it oh he's stud yeah when he had his mustache to look like that guy in the in modern warfare um yeah he's bait he's like a real he's like supposed to be the godfather of free running isn't he in real life that guy he invented free running he's a french guy nice and he made a movie called block 13 i think where they were like henry's good uh parkour movie are you sorry henry is the first person oh yeah i've seen that with charlton yeah yeah that's a good i mean it's a what it's a wanna isn't it but it is cool there's some cool action sort of like branded shots am i not on that yeah you missed it you were a bit more to the right for me wow dude i'll come along with you anyway save this guy yeah why not i think he saved something oh my god he dropped kicked him whilst he was on the floor for me you're safe now what was he giving us immunity booster nice oh my god jack don't do it i was tempted wastes the boom stick on the random civilian oh god no can you imagine my chat would go crazy yeah how do i even use it where is it is it on you put it on your like accessory like hot wheels whatever it's called is it one it's on one self-made gun created from scrap i still don't think we should waste it around either we gotta find someone worth oh my god just landed right on that thing you have two new messages [Music] why did he say nailed it you hear that no i just heard someone nailed it inhibits a container detected i don't know if you know this but the more infected you get at night the stronger you get is that true um well you get more for it yeah [Music] you get like more bonuses for attacking them at night okay when i try and make this jump if i get close enough space oh did you make it yeah you blow me yeah can you maybe parkour from below to get up here there might be some probably like yellow things to jump around stairs or something no like stay on the outside yeah try to find a way oh yeah yeah [Music] there you go and then is there another way up should be oh no i think i'm screwed [Music] well i'll go back inside and say i've got a bunch of options around here it's parkour go back to the roof over here where the uh the zip is there's a hook you can grab on and then you can get where i am which one so come come this side of the building oh yeah i see i see what you mean i'm gonna do it as well actually i'll probably get more height [Music] okay try and land on that ledge just below the swings yeah i got it it's very seamless animation isn't it yeah it's cool

feeling like the second half the game is holding up i'm enjoying the second half way more than the first half like the first half's got so much like exposition and i don't know the gameplay isn't as fun but now you've actually got stuff it's just a lot more enjoyable jessica died here come back you got burnt to a crisp did you have to investigate all players required yeah [ __ ] there aren't any paintings left everything's been shut hey the one found our collector and their sign of his collection oh that was the guy hey you there jesus aiden i told you i was leaving she's going to a party

mandalorian right come on doc here you are thank you for the vodka thank you god i can't imagine drinking alcohol out of them be weird whiskey baby i saw her with you now we played the game and i asked the wrong question about her life after escaping from waltz godzilla gotcha you got her thinking about the past listen and i'm not telling you this because i like you i don't even [ __ ] know why i am telling you this but never never ask lavan about her past oh no dude that's gonna come up at some point tom no it probably is is his birthday yeah because you remember when we gave him the alcohol as a birthday gift jack tom i don't remember anything anymore right life's a blur i mean i just wake up make a video go to bed don't even know what day it is monday isn't it i think no it's

the american office hell yeah so good isn't it yeah if you watch the british one yeah yeah american office is like funnier but i think the british is darker you missed the jump i did yeah i ruined myself what's this where are you doing oh i've got my like wolverine hands this is so cool uh oh yeah i need to get mine on this guy's got the alarm out time more people to own with my wolverine fingers ow oh that just looks sick what if the um the boomstick is that it tom it did nothing let me try i missed why does he just go whoa that means pretty cool dude it did barely any damage maybe i was too caught up off the health i need to put mine on dude they're really cool i bet you can mod them how do i look in like third person you look sick dude thanks uh hold on put mine on as well what is it the claws they're 40 base damage that's pretty good oh yeah you can mod them as well flames but they're like you can obviously because you've got one on each hand you can like attack really fast i'm wolverine then yeah oh my god look at the block that is sick you still have time logan did i i i watched that again like a couple of weeks back i can't watch it i watched it once in the cinema cried my eyes out breaks me bought it on blu-ray and i've never watched it again because i'll just i can't bring myself to do it i mean it's devastating so good though probably one of the best marvel movies i've seen cinematography is great in it what big spear there massive boat here that's a ship i'll probably explore that somewhere there's a mission on it you're probably in it we were in it i didn't realize we're in a ship the whole time oh no that makes sense why there's so many decks and levels yeah yeah we're just idiots yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah god it's so annoying that you can't jump when you're in these areas i know i just want to drop kick everyone [Music] talk to juan again man's got a grinder man's got a grinder yeah man's not grinding teleporting the leader in five seconds why does it count down it doesn't usually it's just because i guess you've selected to teleport me without giving me an option oh no oh he is a snake sounds like we're hernando's tom looks like we're in anders jack i've never seen that happen in hernando that doesn't happen you're not around by me on top of the table i'll wait for you let's make it quick i must admit your persistence almost curious what you do after i send you packing yet again you'll regret it yeah you know you're in a dream huh modeled a year before the pandemic broke out not the pandemic oh god [Music] nando's just stopped oh it's back would you call it a pandemic or an outbreak i love this stuff for over half a million dollars what a sublime present you take any longer pouring it geez what the hell this is strange okay so the characters look really good when they've got a light source near them drink should we play along we're gonna play along don't worry yeah to your health handsome drink up what can i say you broke down my defenses so you're still after those lamps give me the lumps why he wanted them and why he really wanted them yeah to take control of the tv tower wait he's serious is he crazy nobody tried that for over a decade matt wants to prepare to defend the city from the butcher's coming attack so we should start building him a monument right only problem the butcher isn't planning any attack how do you know now you have my spies among the renegades as well since the end of the war we have occupied the city center while the colonel squats in the dam one push of a lever and half the city will find itself under toxic water the colonel is not stupid he knows war would be the end of everything what about the uv lamps why does he want them then jack is hiding something for a while now he's been ordering way more lamps than he could possibly need and then some of those lamps always disappear no accounting for them once we deliver too many of the quantity and i was impressed my health won i need the lamps to just fire the boxes just turned off sister right aidan i told you i got my spies might be able to find something out about waltz and your sister specifically about gre scientists you and matt are trying to contact i'd even say with my resources i can find this person faster than matt i actually doubt he's able to find them at all what should we do uh how many seconds do you have 18. maybe chad can respond fast enough no help him i'll stick with matt help him i think he's more interesting than that that's the only reason barely in town a minute and you picked the right side already i'll give you the lamps that'll keep matt from getting suspicious but then go to the cathedral there's a guy hiding out there total nut job by the tech savant get him to fix this old piece of spy tech if we get it spy tech okay that sounds interesting we made the right decision have him do his thing by tapping matt's comms we'll find out what he's doing with the extra lamps and knowings half the battle kiddo you're goddamn right i think this is gonna be a good quest yeah parkour level up hey a glaive as well i got i mean look at this sex dungeon here tom there's a glaive uv lamps everywhere candles i don't think what's in these drawers [Music] caution yeah 12. um you guys have fun this doesn't seem safe to have a bath jack have you seen this i didn't even see that the guy with a bloody blow torch on the other side like it keeps wait don't feel like you keep glitching through it the sparks keep coming through he's the assassin he is he's making a hole through to what does that mean ruin us oh yeah i've got a parkour point to spin what shall i get oh i got the enemy jump on yeah that looks good i haven't even used that yet press baseball darting dash and get an enemy it's something that's really good bash have you got the bat i love the dark dash i do yeah the bash or the dash i've got the bash and the dash the bash and the dash right upwards on vertical surfaces now i'll go i'll go for the bash while in dart da okay you just press left button whilst you're in dash mode that's cool yeah you can't really craft many of those boom sticks can you some paul cathedral what hang on tom look at these did they just go forever doing this what just constantly doing push-ups where are you what he just sprung no they just go forever cookers and this one this man just stood up oh we can come on let's put you back into it [Laughter] the music is like aliens well as you got this ain't no other way to save us until today binoculars looks so creepy i am the purveyor per something i want to slide like let me slide down this would be great yeah apex style yeah you're gonna play that new apex game mode oh yes domination kind of mm-hmm looks sick didn't it it's gonna be interesting on the eighth when it comes out right 700 meters away this system blimey can we use a fast travel nearby i don't know is that one i don't know if you have them in this main city if they're only in the other one i think they are why did i just injure someone then i didn't get very far there did i just be honest there's a lot of people around there you can injure people with a glider i think i just landed on their head mm-hmm yeah the music in that area reminds me of aliens it's got that kind of vibe to it yeah it's hard not to make music these days and not be similar to something everything's been made doesn't it yeah i should know about not much that's why dubstep was so like popular and it was because it was just something new and now everyone hates it what a ghost yeah right anyway the cathedral's been locked up for years but there's scaffolding around it you can probably use that to climb to a window and get inside still sure you want to run errands for juan might as well suit yourself big boy suit yourself big boy this is new music as well i've not heard this one before it is a big cathedral that yeah that's massive i suppose we get to climb it try your dashboard you can full sundance off that [Music] that is quite fun try these wall marine cores out you've not used them yet no oh they are great i always wanted these in battlefield 1 because there was actually honestly there's a uh this didn't exist in the f1 today in world war one people did actually use wolverine cores to fight in the trenches yeah there was a lot of melee combat in the trenches and uh they would like fashion claws that they would wear it was it was quite rare but it did happen and there's like examples and pictures of real ones that it's crazy i never knew about it i think i made a video i was like please dice put these in battlefield one yeah that'll be sick chapel of the resurrection i don't think i'm supposed to be in here yet oh no it's a bit further out than that gonna break the game ow forsaken store [Music] just pretty chill isn't it like running across the level in parkour in like this yeah i really like it it's hard to remember all of your abilities though because there's some stuff that i just like don't use that much really want to use but i just forget i have it yeah whoa [Music] i got this game for xbox but the sound turn off when i'm playing is that normal no that's not normal [Music] should we try and get this while we're on the way what is it oh god there's a land mine there there's a military convoy could hijack the back of it and get some good loot one of the mines just tripped careful there's one on your left oh they're gonna turn it around yeah i think they're running towards us and blowing them up you can just jab yeah it's made of sound though which is bringing more noise there's a fire out here oh my god there's so many there song what the hell i don't know what to do if i throw that there that'll run away from it and then i can just lock pick it it's a uv light i mean are you gonna have enough time yeah yeah i'm in now there you go grab your stuff and run it's on the back of that you get it yeah i got it i'm out all right let's go good call right we have to climb this somehow it's probably closer to where this purple light is it's in here gotta be let me go into this yeah turn your light on wait oh i accidentally used my use your uv light i use my the rest of my boobs thick that's just a dead end tom yeah oh here it is well you when did you use your boobs just nicer to turn your legs yeah i'd press middle mouse instead of pressing t oh no that's gone i just found it at some cages oh no have you used these yet these are fun the shoots no go on come over here press c on that what the hell it's a slide then yeah these are all over the place suppose you haven't seen them yet no i love it i didn't think you could interact with stuff like that there was a weapon in the van was there back there i didn't see oh you missed it what kind of weapon was it i'm gonna go back all right i'll be in and out if it's still there i'll take it i think i'll shine my light on him for you here you go i think it's d spawn time there's nothing yeah that's the spawn let's go it's getting night time as well [Music] no no dude that changes so fast double drop kick yeah the uh the sunset period is very brief on sunrise if you look at the time in the bottom right it's like one minute per second yeet oh look at this this is cool how do we get up there then it's generator here oh here i have to jump across to it like this whoa uh my guy decided to do a wall run uh you hold space instead of tapping it yeah that's better this is cool land in the trash this is cool a big statue oh boy this is creepy as heck i don't see any zombies down there welcome oh it's a boss it's gonna be a boss isn't it many have come here is that rope we can grab maybe or left we've got it's going to stay up here for a second let me try and make the jump i wonder what you feel no it's not primitive beings [Music] and just kill you what the [ __ ] happened here can i get down to you though i'm dead now how do i get you back all right i'll respawn all right it's a kettlebell station hey you're there are you serious do you respawn or what yeah british space response all right [Music] we're gonna have to use the uv flashlight now aren't we [Music] well not really unless there's zombies did you jump to there why is that what did you glide uh i just jumped oh there's a zip there and then okay chelsea you can't join your friends online for some reason chelsea there's a bug if you're on pc and you have more than 300 friends you have to delete some friends so you're below 300 and then how did you make that jump did you shift jump it yeah ah see i was just doing a normal jump yeah thanks jack yeah how are you using your ub flashlight it's middle mouse you have it on the um press one you cycle through it and i sure haven't equipped it yet yeah it is there but when i press middle mouse it just puts my flashlight on do i have to like on a question like you hold oh you have to hold it do you yeah like oh i see i get it i get it i was just clicking it yeah it blinks long enough to like i don't think you can hold it down for long anyway but it blinks long enough to them and then you just get away this is gonna be a cool boss fight isn't it oh god surely it's gonna be a really cool boss fight we're gonna drop kick him caldera looks spooky it's big c this is not gal there are my friend you're on ps5 i don't know then could just be like enable online maybe for public i'm just going to craft a boomstick i use mine it's all crafted yeah i can't i need more scraps here we go boss fight let's go behind us isn't he that's the biggest enemy i've seen so far incredible bulk i'm gonna get some protein i'm gonna use my boomstick against him [Music] i'm gonna use my boomstick i did a good day yeah that works i'll use mine and there's one overall what about this grenade i like this in my hands watch out jack i'm doing grenades oh it blew up in my hands all right [Music] it won't let me yeah you got it oh no good save good save drop kick him tom drop kick him tom drop kick it's actually doing a decent amount of damage surprisingly i've got more enemies to fight that's what i say oh my god there's so much damage jesus [Music] needs more drop kicks yates [Music] the spears around grab them yeah i just got to heal let's make it a big damage as well oh container [Music] oh yeah it's over big guys mess of flesh and disgusting polyps are you looking at his feet dude look at him hold on oh yeah i see him you see them you're trying to drop kick his corpse from the top rope it's tomographic yep we did it mate we did him oh who's the actual guys oh there's a horse here huh no that's just a dead horse you shoot it no it's a hot showdown jack dude you put him out of his misery just like might as well be doing the out dance on his corpse [Music] no we have to be electricians again do we oh bloody hell it's a dying light bulb three ignorant of the foot i got it wait kurt was in the first game yeah i think so i hope you like this room because it will be your final resting place right it sounds like trump oh great cables i've got to find a source of power electricians let's go find the cables follow the cables follow the cable cable cable follow the cable back the way we gain uh through there but we can't get through that time that looks like sheer pain i mean i don't know what it does look like sheer pain must be a way to pop maybe this way where i was before oh over the roof when i parkoured here when i said from the top rope oh maybe not i don't see anything at least what's with the organ man who's playing that everyone's dead hey i'm the mad man there is a zip line there but i don't know god run through willing to try it no don't don't don't that's clear oh it's okay i don't understand i can't open it it's like a gre key that i can't use yeah i guess we don't go through that oh what do you mean like how how would we possibly do it there you go thank you you're the best full health as well med kit um unless there wasn't like a way in that room must be up here oh yeah a little park over here inhibitor container nearby i don't know i like how he was like this is gonna be a final resting place and then we can just run out and the doors open and it's fine tom this is floating in the air have you noticed yeah there's no cable attached we it's physical through here maybe visitor is not allowed no this was blinking it's light [Music] are you smarter than a 10 year old probably not i mean maybe we just get electrocuted until we get to the top we know that much that can't be right [Music] it's fine nope i probably could have made that with full health i'm waiting for revive now as well just trying to make the last jump jump forget about me that can't be the right way to it's definitely not but i mean if we could have like memed it right well it spawned us in these rooms i feel like we're missing something here follow the cable to the main power supply so we've got to get over this fence somewhere look for a place where it's not electrified well it's all unless you're here pull the plug out f4 players required you're kidding i pressed q to scan you're not scanning enough jack you're not scanning enough time that the way we came now through the doors no we can yeah we can go through the mainstream saluting this i might be able to try it you know let's just get electrocuted for the i can't believe it was that simple come on man it's always easier than it looks that's my problem when i play rpgs like i always think that it's more complicated than it actually is never nice i just uh cancelled your assassination for the meme watch this i missed it game on the ground trying to floor him nice and watch this oh i can't do it [Music] oh get off me just saw you behind hey you where are you we need to unplug the main source don't we damn you yeah um there's one here all players needed press q remember yeah yeah great job off the ladder also container you got that it's a lock pick yeah i'm on it i've got you covered tom it's open he's one he's one he's one he's one he's yeah oh i got a sick mask he's playing yeah dude look at my mask i look sick [Music] whenever they struggle like that i've got an ability where i press f and just jump on their head right up here yeah the zombies as well as um after zombies can't help you i'm falling down the ladder looking back that's very strange you're just sliding up the ladder like super mario or wreck-it ralph sweet okay that that's that's electrocuted so we'll obviously find a way over here maybe yeah oh god that doesn't look safe yeah we gotta unplug this electricians tomorrow and jack iii [Music] then back the way we came because the other one was electrocuted electrified oh there's a slide there i think yeah we don't need that we have to hop over follow the cables but i wanted to go on the slide dad yeah oh yeah but we're gonna miss this oh got it you killed leto what else do you want was a monster dude unblock this one do you not see with your own eyes what he was where are you who are you where is she rachel oh here we came this way where's the cable going down there over there uh wait wait wait wait through here up this [Music] gotta be a safe oh here we go zipline trying to grab it safely no oh that was close i got it i got it good job though good job i just yielded myself off tom you get yourself you can climb no just here oh god he got stuck in the fence what the hell let me stomp him come on boom see definitely get that one stompy [Music] sorry oh that's not the one it's a good laugh disco yeah it's great fun i think it's flawless co-op i'm just glad it's an option you know have you got the windmill attack when you press caps lock when you hold power no watch how'd you do that so hold have you got the when you hold to do your power i don't have it yeah my windmill next so good big groups and stuff that looks so slow though tom it does nice because it it is slow it's because it does the it's better with like the larger weapons oh the two handers because it it basically just like draws out the length of the hit so like you always hit as you do the full spin yeah this will be the last one yeah i think okay inhibit our container detected fine curt [Music] um zip line tom oh yes let's go baby close the doors behind us don't want anything to do with that he's gonna be through it i was knew where the ladder was mr smuggy puss i just finished the observatory mission one of the best missions i played in any game really oh well that sounds fun i don't think we've done that yet uh no offs can you take the hp bars off if you want yeah you can get that one i play with no zombie health bars it's way better yeah i don't need to know how much health health a zombie has jack so i'd recommend doing it because it just looks so much better it's more immersive i keep the human health bars on i have the zombie health bars off because the bosses will always have a massive health bar at the top of your screen when you're getting a boss fight but a regular zombie i don't need to know i mean we've just presumed that this is the right way it has to be it definitely is yeah because he was up here this is where he was like yelling at us from how did we get container over here canned is it like one way you can swing or is it just one that pulls you up to wherever you hit it probably that was that like a baseball tom that's a cricket bat nice wow i didn't get that one was different really you didn't get the cricket bat no it's randomly for both of us 43 damage yeah that's a cricket bat nice i love that for you that's cool he's up here jack he's one i don't want to do this without you all right run out and spam i have to call up it there you go he's up there come on we're going to go murk him tom it's fine we stood on the ledge i thought we could just drop i don't know if it's going to let you kill him because he was in the first game what was he like a big character in the first game because i didn't play it i think so i vaguely remember i just know the name kurt what's this it's a log pic here i can't climb up that you can just swing with it me she says okay okay that's cool that'll be really good for parkour especially areas where like something is just out of reach all right we've got to go there's going to be a chase here isn't there i think ready probably yeah i think it's going to be good oh no it's csgo surf maps oh my god surprise it's me so sad how did he just dude people teleport in this game they teleport absolutely mental oh there's a zipline okay yeah but i mean there's no way he could have been he's next to me what his character model was just next to me still up there that's unusual keep chasing him get him tom get him you're ahead of me drop kick him off the roof there's a mannequin there probably shutting doors on us again are they [Music] you can punch me in the face from the left that's just so predictable we dodged it go on kill me just tell my son i died like a warrior what are you talking about kill me she sent you to do it so your eyes mistaken no idea what that's supposed to mean this guy what do you want he's got the mike tyson tattoo i recognize him but i don't think at the tattoo at the time he's just a bold guy it's an old spy tag i need it fixed that's all is that all well i have no intention of helping you seriously weren't you just begging me to kill you that option is still open kill me or kiss my ass no what do i care about your problems we know nothing about each other i don't want to kill him some so um who's this woman who wants to kill you vagina dentata a vagina with fangs what a major [ __ ] did you see that movie that good enough for you i see maybe i can help you don't know what you'd be up against i handled that monster down there the zipper's broken on the bottom with a speaker by comparison some of the dialogue in this is so weird man like it's so unnatural who are you really i mean if you were if you were like if you grew up in this environment would it be normal i don't know i don't think so do you think it's intentionally weird or no i just think it's bad sometimes right you mentioned you had a son like everything else taken away from me they the script itself for the way they're saying it spit in any street in this city and you'll hit somebody who lost a loved one okay what fixes that you want the spy tag i need to plant this bug on a radio translator but it needs to be fixed i'll make it worth your while impossible without a few parts what parts the wiring is corroded you can find replacements in the north tower the army left their gear there how will i find it it would be protected from the elements so look for a box below the antenna all right fine and uh what's your price let's leave that for later one bitcoin surprise i really don't like surprises good luck not again interesting hmm i just dropped kicked the mannequin yeah it despawned when you did that i didn't even see it the first time what is this place anyway the biggest church in the country this is really the sunset is really nice this way to the east oh yeah that looks good i'm going up again oh god i'm almost falling off as well you got a balance on those no plus ratio keeps an inhibitor container is that it there unknown location i guess so up on the roof do you have to keep parkour and up doing i don't know um yeah it looks like it the objective's up there you can't grab onto anything there yeah it's outside look like if you come out here and look up you can see like a swing thing so we've got like looks to the left is there a way of finding oh oh the gargoyle that's sick that's full batman that is this is huge well those who built it believe that this way they would get closer to god but when the epidemic came it didn't help anyone don't look down oh jack i could swing on the same thing as yours keepers have you gone oh my god i managed to grab the zipline last second you survived again come all the way up again i tried to swing at the same time because you grabbed the pole first i couldn't do the same thing oh why didn't you grab on to the bell what oh you think yourself it didn't it didn't grab onto the bell there's a bell in there that has yellow stuff on it yellow means crab yeah it does mean grab and he didn't grab some i don't know what to tell you i'll grab my bells again yeah i see that i mean did you sure you landed in the right place yeah i think so yeah i just i

down sorry if you've updated it then you can come down now right the next objective isn't up there anymore or is it bring it to cut i really should have dropped the ladder down tom yeah you can still do it where you are right [Music] i can't help you unless i parkour fast enough i'm coming how high up are you though uh high up [Music] will i respawn yeah okay just you you won't respawn where you are i tried to pop the parachute but it didn't come out oh good we don't need to be up there anymore though but i wanted to do the ladder tom we don't need to go up there again oh it's right here yeah

mad gamer so what did you click to fast travel i just clicked on the area that i'm at and held f it's the whole game co-op trim out yo you have to get to a certain point and then you can play co-op i'd say it was about like two hours maybe is that right tom would you say before you can call it it's after hakkon takes you through the hospital and it plays like a little flashback i think if you when you were younger i'd say it was about two hours from memory yeah i'd say so if you speed running probably like an hour if you're not if you don't care about loot yeah i can't fast travel okay i'll see if this teleports you then one sec yeah it'll give you the option to [ __ ] prisoners gotta go to see one again he's gonna be uh in bed with the lady you're back teleport players he looks

windmill for ground flight crowd control i'll go with that it just smacks everyone away from you so you just press con uh caps lock yeah hold hold your power attack and then do caps lock cool rain is

just came from this way so oh my god he's outside the whole time the whole time people don't like our rules come up with better ones yeah is this where wait is 400 meters you fast travel again should

to you i think i can make it big jump [Applause] i got too close to one of the um [ __ ] yeah one of the screamers there's a repel here we can use yeah i'm going up now that's horrible i hate that yeah if you craft uv lights you can throw one at your feet and they can never catch you in the chase ends like immediately really yeah it's not a bit cheesy though that feels that well yeah if you if it's interrupting the mission or like is that captain price that's a calm down stick so you're ready oh my god he doesn't have the right voice come on the meeting's in the vip room he's dressed exactly like captain price [ __ ] chris i suppose it's just like military uniform he's got a beard though his face looks like in there calm down jack before you pop a vessel this planet is total [ __ ] do better how about this do nothing it's definitely man there isn't a high time we put this [ __ ] before a firing squad wow the dog started barking guess i better behave all right whoa fellas you brought me here to plan something right i do these are the vnc tower plans it looks so much like price dude it does once we get the power back on we can re-establish and then the middle bit shaved throughout the city we'll learn about our mission they'll be able to join in and help us so maybe they have video games in the apocalypse propaganda what's the inspiration to defend against the renegades when the butcher sees how strong we are he'll retreat we'll prevent war however there are a few matters we need to take care of first see this building this is an electrical substation that powers the district if we get it running we'll be able to power the vnc tower our unit is already on its way step one is securing the perimeter around the tv station my men will do that i'll head out sir of course rogue good luck we won't disappoint you sir yes we'll do our best sir who asked you where's powsky you'll move your ass away he's a decent voice actor the guy that plays right one of my soldiers wow oh imagine all the grieving touches i mean look at that like what kind of a line is that yeah thank you that's so weird though secure the entrance my men will bring the lamps and set up an outpost since the plan's author is the commander-in-chief himself you'll turn on the elevators and ride it to the top and when you get to the roof you attach the transmitter to the antenna got it got it you don't just go a bit insane when your life is confined to a base like this the substation roseman will secure the perimeter with lamps i got it but tom imagine all the grieving tonsils oh yes or get yourself killed but my neck's not on the line here see you at the tv station it's a great day we've all been waiting for [Music] yes it's a great day we've all been waiting for [Laughter] zero expression so we're gonna get on top of the antenna antenna and santa i heard jack and juan are trying to sell you a hot load of poor [ __ ] oh god wait we don't have to go back there do we i used to be in the floor oh no because right here it's the same spot yeah i thought they were going to say the cantina the bloody ship that we were just that go back all the way there are they sat on a sunbed what the hell why is she glistening like a twilight vampire do you see that i'm coming upstairs now tom she's good she's glistening like a vampire very fast travel i'm right here tom 20 meters away yeah but i went upstairs and no she's not glistening for me that's very unusual oh took a break from assassinations to come see me i'm just trying to keep you out of trouble what are those warm-ups it'll be like a texture thing you've gone on ask me to climb the vnc tower what sons of [ __ ] you know what that place is the tallest building oh that looks cool being said oh baby i hate those [ __ ] roll meyer they're solid but jack and juan they're destined to stab you in the back looks a bit glistening in her hair i won't be alone thomas with me that's all right the pk's will be with me jack said i won't be alone jack jack frank's with me creatures that live there i know it's dangerous luan i have to do this i've heard there are things there things no one has seen or actually and lived to tell big monsters you sound scared of course i'm scared aiden oh i didn't know you cared [ __ ] you look a few years ago frank tried to do what jack is planning and it was a tragedy don't believe me ask him yourself what are you planning jack entrance to the tv stage i went to the co-op and i bought a bunny rabbit suit frank oh boy let's see where this is going don't do this you're trying to address the zombies up in bloody web outfits will you what should we do go to the tower talk to frank um i think she wants to talk to frank right so if you want we've already pissed her off once when we asked her two personal questions and she wants us to talk to frank first so i think we should talk to friends okay i'll talk to frank thanks aidan you're doing the right thing there we go we're in a good box again come on it's so uh it's so enthralling listen frank's here okay what the hell was that sleeping oh no open the door we have to wake him up frank are you alive man very joint huh ravic i told you to [ __ ] leave me alone now it's me aidan who uh it's you what do you want tell me about the vnc tower we were so close back then eden so close despite what the others said i really did have a good plan a solid plan but it was a bloodbath a bloodbath frank how do i get to the rooftop we went in without a full team hmm bastards if they'd only had i think we need this intro stuck with me yeah be good but one lost faith let the others astray who was that a judas that's who if it wasn't for wrath past is dead so they say what matters is that was the end of the night ronis were you a night runner and dying like one okay but i don't remember another term was thrown around a lot you can't nobody can we can do it tom mean you can do it [ __ ] you rude okay we can do it we've got wolverine claws dude come on let's go are you ready yeah the night runners were like there's people that they're like a faction that helped people in the other city so there were better days okay i've never been to that area of the map this is cool have you well you wouldn't have been over there either would you no definitely not i can see the towel from here so should we have spoken to the craft master do you hit that treat it's fine oh no i'm about to land on a howler not like this yeah maybe we should have spoke to the craftmaster first what for just a case we could have upgraded our glider oh this is cool something's wrong oh i just kicked a howler oh no completely accidental is it chasing you yeah sure i'm on it oh my god you're so many when you are now i'll just stay in the air it'll be fine won't it i really missed [Applause] are you still getting chased i'm okay i'm okay trying to get high here gre anomaly what yeah i'm looking at that powerful infected that corrupts the areas reanimates the dead around it oh my god after you defeat the revenant and thereby military container will open you'll be able to loot inhibitors from it that's new okay i've encountered it or you've encountered it maybe i did i think it's in here i don't know i don't like it right we're at the tower oh buddy i'll start my own chase over here this is a safe zone anton okay i mean it's not very safe at the moment i have to be honest with you because the amount is the uv light there uh yeah there is oh this qriket man is sick is it can't get this guy to the spikes here look missed he actually went over the spikes you kill it behind you as well i got him bye i love when you smack their masks off yeah it's a cool effect oh we got spikes craft master there's no one here oh i took care of the runner gates power up the substation follow the cables under the ground ah this way there's an arrow yeah got it nice multi-function we've got to be electricians again tom yeah no david thank you for the one that's very kind of you man look at this get the substation running i think we're gonna have to open this thumb these are different though jack it's right there look i know that's [Music] there's no power to open this can you plug it in here oh no it's b okay i'll have a look up here is it it might yeah you can plug it in there tom okay and then you can open it but it needs to go in a different one doesn't it so i'm gonna take it out no no no keep it in case i open this next gate can i just plug it in there oh yeah that'll work you can see that one plug it again okay plug in this one oh it does not reach this one up here uh truth this is part four you're watching part four right now buddy this is a live stream um yeah there's a green one there there's another way in though this green one up here too parkour on the left there sorry up here look no zombies no power see this one this one i'm at right now i can't open that door either some blue here there are some zombies below us so that door needs to open i'm in here tom i made it to this one open the gate for me can i yeah yellow gate you can open it oh he didn't say cheese is on my wife he said geez i miss my wife okay ah that makes presents can you plug it into one then or is that a different one where's one where is it that's your left down below um you see it yeah i'm just thinking what's the shortest route is it is it four one yeah it's number one if you can power that up i might turn this on for c and then i can open it and plug i think i've got enough room here yeah yeah does that power this let's turn something on what's moving i was just the generator starting off yeah the generator here hmm still no power to this door i really don't want to rush it oh sure bro move your goddamn ass yo mrs chan watch out for venom unless that can go somewhere else well you can try and plug it into c which is here where i am if you unplug it from one how would i get up there though parkour can you jump onto this ledge yeah and then climb up this 15 meters yeah you can do it then nice does that open this then yes then you plug two into the one you just left have you got two it's a little lighter now you need a code for that oh that's intro i've not seen that before no where would you get the code must be having something for it so could two go into that oh no i've bugged it i think what you mean i've got one here yeah this this happened to stod i need to drop out well i'm stuck like i plugged it in and now i'm stuck what if i do this does that fix you did you plug it in yeah yeah i go drop out can you just reconnect you need to invite me [Music] that's the second game breaking bug i've had well that's happened that happened in our previous one i just didn't know it was repeatable like you need to do it in your own mission if i try and do it it breaks it i guess i can't invite you son apparently i just picked up the code as well for that safe oh good i can't invite you some uh let me quit the main menu instead instead of being in my world yeah i'll go back to the safe and take a look i didn't read it when i picked it up it's the collectible that i just got i got you tomographic still can't invite you hmm i'll try again nope should i do the same i don't know where it would save us that we might lose some progress huh what do you think yeah let me let me just relaunch the game entirely okay you just figure out that safe [Music] which um collectible was it on guys should be a note safe code approximate number of pi pi is 3.14 isn't it so it's gonna be three three fourteen yeah [Music] i think pie starts three point [Music] i'm going to make a fool of myself here no i've got it right hey oh hello there's an inhibitor in there oh no way can you reinvite it i'll give it a go or if it's even gonna spawn there anyway no hold on let me just quit the game then okay you should be sure to drop out and restart the match i guess i think you need to quit the whole game yeah i'll just go to main menu then continue yeah i forgot that happened to me installed weird on was it with the cable or just jumping on something yeah if i i plugged the cable in and then it just like latches me to it i can't move anywhere [Music] loading back up now um online menu friends it's is it because i'm like i don't know just says visibility single player can i change that it's cool i have to do call for help don't i yeah and then i can add you invite to game we didn't do it this way before did we i think so i think you do here we go through the online menu do you get that i got it yeah connecting just keep playing a sec it's not let me click it which is weird standing right he's spamming me yeah hang on what's up monkfish am i planning to try seafood yeah i had a little go on it earlier it was really good i keep thinking you're saying seafood no sifu s-i-f-u f-u fu fu all right let me relaunch the game for a third time yeah thanks chad for telling me about that collectible i i pick things up and i don't read them that's how i play single player games i'm glad that you guys have got my back let's do this again what's up bashar how you doing man is this game worth buying i think if you like the first game you probably like this one and he plans to play stream horizon forbidden west yeah definitely [Music] you don't even have to enjoy the first game as well this one doesn't really follow off like they said there was no reoccurring characters and they they just told a fib just to surprise you because there's a couple but they're not really not enough where you need yeah you don't need to know the story did i try inviting you again okay let me see if it just friends only yeah try when you click add friend nothing happens if i click this tomo send invite i'll send it once nothing hang on how does this work [Music] i think i'm in player tomographic has joined e boom on that okay where's this safe can i open it as well or is it um i presume so it appears um i will have to open it again we'll have to do the first i'll leave that to you power thing i remember how to do it now so this way oh did you drop out and it but you reset everything oh okay okay you have to be above drop in here i go down here plug that in open that gate [Music] i think i'm too high up here okay you need to you drop down one [Music] are you in there's a ladder here [Music] let me just check if i can open this before i drop down i'll decide you plug you plug this one into it's on this floor lower floor i'll open the gate for it go down these stairs here and then this one you took i'm gonna let you do the cables and you plugged it in i think you parkour over there didn't you was it the main one yeah parkour across go up that sidewalk was up here wasn't it and then yeah and that opens the sea door and then this time you take the cable from sea room down to floor one yeah the safe's in here [Music] wait i did that wrong sorry i presume i can get it without picking up the collectible yeah there you go i might even give it you twice it's not an inhibitor this time not for me what is it for you did you get some loot anyway yeah i got the inhibitor med kit that's cool yeah so now take two to floor one sorry um look at this it's a lower level what the one in the middle yeah it'll work for you it just doesn't work for me if i take this oh this is where it bugged doesn't it for you yeah some co-op junk is that one one yeah and now is there a third one that we've missed and maybe there is another green one i think it's above from memory there's no way up here is that no the rope swing from there where to um couldn't make that jump there's a lower basement level engine room oh there we go how'd you get down there come to the stairs in the middle ground floor hey look how did we miss this what the hell i don't know oh it's just covered in water this is the socket for it though so where is it this event here yeah it's gonna be for the event left or right oh god that is so weird surge says the ambient music has mass effect vibes totally man it sounds exactly like mass effect i love it let's just crawl a bit faster yeah it's so slow oh you can go left there doesn't look there's anything to the left though zombies in front [Music] master how not to cable manage your house is it even in here or is it just a secret loot room is there another left way is that a gun oh it's the gun hammer again okay did you go down the left no clapping the gate here though oh good [Music] does this take us back to where we were yeah the machine's over there should we take the left route go back in the vent be quicker this way yeah you got it we can't i can uh don't go right here [Music] go left again [Music] uh what this is the same room though how is that the same oh it loops around again there's like the other way like the loot room brings you back anyway it's gotta be above somewhere it's on right yeah it is let's have a look because you can see it because it's green well look there's do you look do you see the swing the rope swing at the top there's a third level that we haven't accessed yet could you climb up it i think we need to wait there's an elevator shaft there nothing closed yeah like you can't get it from there i tried that and i just fell off what are you trying to do uh no like there's a ladder here tom had a boost trumpet yeah let me try the ladder that takes you to the other floor yeah i think you're in it there's a gate there [Music] swing across there you go you found it [Music] that's locked from inside though use the same rope swing up over here there's a container i can open [Music] can't open these doors though oh the players are waiting for you i mean i'm not waiting for you to do anything i was just opening a lockpick i've opened it here look you can't get through these doors though either way um [Music] can we take one out of the one one of the previous ones [Music] might need to there are only two try to switch the plugs okay so which one could we get down there then [Music] i guess it'll be number one the ground floor one that's plugged in that makes the most sense thinks the other i think c is too far away isn't it [Music] let's see it's got 23 meters okay maybe yeah yeah i think that's easy and that should power up the elevator and then we can take the elevator to the other the gates are locked good job chat let's electrified the floor that's why you need the vents yes can you do anything else though now well you're stuck well i can go through the vents can't i yeah is there an event you can access okay nice maybe one doesn't need power wait probably doesn't does it [Music] i think you need to [Music] get the one from c since c is only a secret door and plug it into the ground floor [Music] you've exited into the sewer again did i did i do that wrong did i go the wrong way i don't think so because the vent access is always i mean i could use the pipes here i think get across yeah just do that from c to one yeah that's it yeah take so take c cable which is only a secret door where you found the safe put that in the ground floor one it's just a case of unplugging and re-plugging but i can't do it because i'll break the game this one here tom i know uh no upper can i know that doesn't have enough length there does it yeah go up parkour onto this level then climb up this that's it it's in here isn't it and then yeah uh yeah plug that into one [Music] bingo and then actually open the elevator on the left hey big brain five head smashed it we had some help from the chat but i think we got there in the end would have got there immediately if uh if it didn't bug me and attach me to the power thing can you do that i'll get the gate [Music] the power's no it's time for you to leave or else oh why do they have such weird voices like this every game has one you know it's like fallout borderlands look at their necks oh they're on something oh you're rod you think you're old mate i'm going to try the windmill jack hold on i want to try um sorry you have fun in there tom okay i like fun do i not have any exploding arrows damn it shock arrows just naded oh that was a good fight for me threw three nades in there i thought i had an exploding arrow but i don't you might have bought the blueprint but not crafted it looks like the plague doctor from honcho down here a little yes survivors this time i think you should give it all to the peacekeepers for this because you'll get an auto crossbow at some point i think you should oper the other city you should do for survivors in this city you should give to peacekeepers it's that kind of vibe isn't it yeah because there's just so many cars around here so you can do car traps and stuff the theme also works better like just matches the city better bases yeah boys are going deeper into the building the area will be secured soon the trade is open down there now we going up that tower i guess i had this dream last night no i shouldn't sell it yet i miss you can we do some upgrades frost you can get a frost mod oh camo axe this guy sells this looks sick 82 damage that's up 33 of my best weapon cossa absolutely bomb though let's have a look which one does he sell a camo axe for you no i don't have that 88 damage you kidding me my max there is like 45 yeah it's a huge increase for me until today i thought our chances against renegades yeah i need feathers to do exploding arrows where do you get feathers from i don't think i've ever seen a feather yeah i haven't seen them where do i have any how many did you need one okay get the first one you've got 18 got 18. oh can i drop can't drop materials backpack i can drop materials that's seven right here i might put some mods on as well do it well if your weapons just don't do it when the weapons are at full health is my motto oh you get the feathers from the birdhouse there you go there's seven here for you one second sorry that's right just don't want to move so you can find them thank you i don't know where i've gone from i need 10 scraps as well okay here you go well if you don't you run out of scraps from making the boomstick so much uh scrap scrap scraps why is it raining on my eyes when you go outside guys does it rain on your eyes that's like that looks like what having a migraine looks like 15 on the ground oh thank you i do like you can drop stuff it's a good way to get your friends started in the game as well because you can drop any legendary gear that's useless to you and they can use it in their own yeah it's super cool i can't apply any of these mods though don't mind um all right let's go to that tower then all right zip up here and then glide off unless can we can we upgrade the glider here no i had a look i don't know when you can do that it might be part of the story it might be like wonderful glider i need to put my shirt back on because i sold the one that i was wearing that one's better nice it's cool that it's raining uh yeah i guess you could say that the guy's wearing glasses yeah lots of games do this though where they're like okay it's raining and now you're gonna have raindrops on your eyes i like it like it does look more immersive 2042 does it and it's like it's weird to me because like when you go outside in real life and it rains i think it's just the case you constantly have to wipe your eyes because the rain's on them it's just because you know you're playing a game and the game knows you're also playing a game so it's like it's raining on your monitor you're looking into a monitor as if you're looking out of a windscreen [Music] apparently she didn't have the upgrade for the glide in my chat saying but it's fine i'll get it later should we go back no no it's fine get later let's do this mission i'm traveling to you know [Music] oliver thank you for the five months man yeah i guess if you wear glasses and you go out in the rain you would actually have to do it because your glasses would just collect the rain when there's a place so but the [ __ ] elevators are still stuck power's not getting to them it seems now the building's been switched off for years right we need to check the electrical relays you a [ __ ] genius the boys from the dark zone already working on it they're trying to locate the power distribution room in a smaller tower connected to this one when my men switch on the elevators we just go up then oh no [ __ ] me it's raw power's out again command says the substation is online and working 5x5 it must be here leon we have a blackout in the main hall you affirmative we're in the dark again god damn it get out of there immediately you got that leon i think there's going to be a lot of zombies in there tom [Applause] leon that sounds fun [ __ ] i have to get to them i'm with you they split up between carter's a and b i'm taking a you go through the recording studios i'm on it good if you're there before me just get them out before the dark gets too dark and watch your back we have no use for dead meat leon hold on leon i think he's going to look like leon from resident evil do i have rage racing gone yes jerry ray tracing is on he's responsible for the black monday bombing all of them crazy information there jack i was bursting for a pee um leon is in trouble there's power out at the bottom of the elevator we've got to go meet captain price here this way cool corridor bee good luck i'm getting it i think there's going to be a lot of monsters down here so i'm looking for yeah we're about to get effed i think i think a lot of people are about to die cautiously we're walking into this elevator they're not coming with us course or not oh that skill's great which one just being able to like climb up things faster without needing to jump yeah that's empty uv why does it just disappear when you're just like yeah zombie zombie zombies light off cue sense there's a lot here jesus yeah go around to the right don't wake him up don't wake dad do you think bow and arrow is that gonna alert them it'll it won't kill him in one hit with it so like oh there's one walking around hang on try and stealth it you can hide here can't do a stealth take down on that thing it's gone it's horrible i've never seen anything like that before it looks like it's got armor on it yeah oh he saw me is there anything to hide under i don't think he's stalled okay what the distraction hold on you've started the other ones though yeah oh they literally okay that was a really good idea it won't hit me you got a uv light oh we're both dead did you want to hit both of us i think it too hit me i mean why did they know where i threw the coin from like they should have just it's because it was so close like they'll look for something that's in the vicinity the coins are used for like mid long range before you approach an area not when you're it like at an area at that at that range you probably want to use the uv light yeah that thing is horrible isn't it one of the big ones from earlier no we haven't seen that enemy before it's not a um oh god i'm hiding hi tom oh yeah you got your flashlight off yeah that's horrific i hate that oh you're twerking for me thanks tom they're volatiles aren't they it's not what it's called i don't i think that might be a volatile look at those cheeks tom i don't know if it is a volatile though tom hold on yes thank you definitely a volatile yeah yeah it's a volatile he doesn't seem to be moving anywhere if we move out here are we done should we try i'm just gonna go this way and see what happens should i uv flashlight no no just come this way okay there's another there's a big one here yeah get around him i think we'll go this way [Applause] yeah there's no way you could do a takedown on that no if you like stand up and crouch quickly you do like a speedier like slide into crouch faster got to go underneath that i think he's still facing this way though night vision goggles would be great um can you distract him uh yes put it on that side yeah that's it if i get close enough to him and then turn the light off did he see me yeah he hit me go go go go go [Applause] oh that's horrible [Music] yeah i'm in the lobby yeah you can't get through that roger don't wait for me the bastards cut me off there's like 20 of them i need to get back to the main hall make your way through the maintenance room to the basement you need the elevator there you see it yeah there's a um event over there on your side oh yeah well it's blocked off though no you could go yeah there's like a green vent i can see it's blocked no not that one tom the one that i'm looking at over here oh yeah yeah yeah okay i don't know if it's my line hold back the way you went can you get in it god i'm stuck i'm stuck i'm in horrible yeah the uh the volatiles have got some serious cheeks man oh yeah i do squats all players required it's got a hole maker next to him it does look like leon i knew it come on that's what it says on my dog what do this is where my story ends bro hey man don't talk like that is there any more survivors aren't you he's got like the rezzy 2 uniform on yeah he's got the hair isn't he i haven't seen that hair anyone else went that way the black guy i think it was his doing like a power back it's the only way to get the elevators working the terminals are in the basement connecting both towers please take this letter and give it to my wife she's on the ship come on yourself you can read that i think he's i think he's done for did you read the second yeah yeah give it to yourself yeah get up stop dying yeah it might it might have been one of those you know what happened with the power come on you're gonna give it to yourself i'll connect these terminals and restore you're gonna make it out of here did you find it i wonder if that's an easter egg as well resident evil you might he said bro as well didn't they like i'm pretty sure leon says that all the time you might have been able to say no i don't think so just uh be careful yeah and chris as well come on chris redfield yeah well if you just said come on give it to yourself i wonder if like it would have played out differently ball jack to leave back to where we were okay yeah don't go in there it's pain you missed a i just got a freaking katana out of this yeah i got a something terrible look at this i got a katana i got a board stick how fun dude that is sick what the hell [Music] nice i don't think i've seen a katana before [Music] chris combo combo breaker this is chris redfield then does he look like chris redfield well he's got the same kind of hair what the what that he just stumped chris redfield's head off i did oh god look at his face what's left of it horrible rape chris redfield is it chris though does it look like him yeah it does it's got the same kind of haircut and like body type i've only played a couple of the resident evil games debated come on open open i couldn't open any time they hit me before i could do it i'm doing it again cover me oh no sorry he's messed him up with my bow i'll do it i'll do it you heal you go what the what the bloomin do you see that that's what looks like no that's a bug i think that's a sound emitter coming from under the map but it's spawned a mass and we can see it that's a new one that's very strange it's a sound emitter isn't it i'll do this one i thought maybe it was like a guy in a lower room like a a robot or something but they built some sort of robot to a temperature wow why am i getting electrocuted by oh my god a wire that you turned on electro zombie oh look at this what the hell ah zombies down wait this is a zombie game yep it never gets old drop kick that first aid cabinet did you get it let's make it in that first air cabinet yeah i got it thank you wolverine [Music] i like how the alarm is in like it matches the music okay good good good job thomas that's cute i think i was still here stroking the zombie the cable from the power distribution standard standard face it better work [Music] i always go up are you well is this a zombie game leon that's a lot of blood who knows no [ __ ] just in case yeah did you finish him off yeah he's dead he's gone you finished him off he's gone now oh tom the hammer pulled you off look what we've got to do love it my favorite thing i just won't touch them either maybe go through a vent i'll just drop down i saw joe frank's man yeah i got it it's not going to make it up there you might missed it in a first aid box another first day boxing you missed another make it don't need those tom next to the electric thing here are these zombies dead it's right here can you rub that thank you you need to swim under with that i can't be safe an electric cable it's got shielding on it it's fine okay trust me bro i'm an electrician i'm not an electrician or that that door hello keep swimming [Music] take a breather here and go back in i got 10 meters tom there's no way oh man open the door oh yeah open the door i'll go back and then we can just straight shot it are you stuck well i have to release it there we go yeah i was stuck there see that's what happens but like you can't break off it i found b i found one you can plug it into i don't know if there was enough room i think if you did it perfectly did the course you'd have enough slack can you not open that door i don't think so this one here i've i've found the thing you plug it into it was like 10 meters away from me swim towards me tom just direct there's a door if you open that door i think i should okay see what i mean and then i can just take it straight through let me have a look ah yellow gate yeah yeah okay an underwater gate gotcha gotta be careful here because it's got a glitch isn't it like it's you'll be all right it's only if i do it like it's yours it's technically your single player campaign so they don't really have the animations for i don't think just keep swimming just keep swimming yeah that's it it's a long cable this one are you teabagging imagine if you couldn't make it by one meter and it's right there how annoying would that be all right the elevators are working all right i did it ever gotten a metal pilgrim never i'll cut you one out of a potato i'm potato we're going up to set up a temporary cat see on the 8th floor 8th floor so pko post no basement tom i've got to test these explosive arrows out [Music] drop underwater i don't think that's possible jr how would that work with physics just they don't doesn't make sense look at this vendor machine yeah golden coin five nice guilden golden more stuff more stuff to eat come on sylvester you know what is this a proximity tool the gre tagged more important goods with special rf markers a potato medal what does that even mean tom how is this is a serious game for serious people and he wants to carve us a medal out of a potato imagine how much a potato is worth to you about enjoyment with you it's finer than gold and lieutenant himself but he suggested giving us a potato medal in this game a potato over a piece of metal that is worthless yeah but it's gonna roll and he's bringing the transmitter i would disintegrate the operation you would eat your medal yeah for a nap or like a chocolate medal just somewhere outside the camp pretty please is it cooked is it roast mashed is it just a raw potato what is it in these times i'll take it however it comes baked would be preferable gre detector see i think it's pretty impressive that we're this late into the game and we're unlocking stuff that's like brand new so like i'd give them credit for that i mean we don't even have the grapple hook yet so who's my guys where's captain price are you crying man he's captain price is crying [ __ ] off i'm so happy there's like so much end game stuff that i mean are they allowed to do that that's captain price they've literally got the character model from modern warfare copy paste change the voice no one knows the similarities jack but he's just got mutton chops with a beret and we made it this time it looks exactly like barry sloan if that's not that's not okay i'm going to sleep time to get some shut ups that's my ep special treat for the night wow you rock lieutenant it's probably slowing down i mean frustrated i'm not a woman i do i don't want to tell you well yeah this guy's soap no it's sylvester slung sylvester slope and pretty lady why do you want to exclude your wife very funny daddy get in there guys we are lieutenant barry we've been through worse right remember what did the bullet say to the man that was just passing through it was we pulled the renegades what about them they're everywhere spreading the city like cockroaches but here the biggest antenna in the city strategic place and no renegades at all ah it's not like anything else they're doing makes sense good point first someone turned on the electricity no idea why and then when i questioned the renegade officer he battled something about gre facilities they're trying to locate didn't make much sense if you ask me x13 or something like that but i'm worried what they're planning x13 i mean that's straight out of x-men isn't it that's just so many references is it a reference tom or is it any idea where it could be is it just stealing well if it's real it could be a gre complex i mean top secret well hidden but once we're done with this [ __ ] maybe we figure out what it is and find it first you gotta get some beauty sleep if this is live say peanuts more when we're rested your mum that was a nice tune you played ghost come in this is price we're going to attack my shepherd's man in the boneyard it looks like there's some zombies around as well we'll see ghost next ghost is not gonna beat it bryce bryce something's wrong at the desk they're targeting their own willing to find out why so many fighters i can trust ghost air and there's uh tomographic he will be the new voice actor have you got a black screen right now i have got a black screen right now this might be the bird goldstone um what buggle can you pause can you pause no no this is the bug what bug the bug i told you about was stud it's the end is it that's it wait for the credits to roll really you can't this is just ruined now yeah it's ruined this is the this is the one major bug i've had okay well i think you know what tom that seems like a good place it seems like a good good place to end yeah four hours that was bloody hell time the other flew by so what you're gonna are you gonna play the rest with stodd then no do you play this well no if stud catches up on his own then if you want three ways three way yeah if you don't because i feel like i should finish it now as soon as i've like put four parts i don't feel like we're far off completing the game i don't want to leave my youtube subscribers in the lunch you know no i get that but three-way sounds delightful in the zombie apocalypse okay all right thanks for playing tom yeah it was fun love you lots enjoyed that love you too bye-bye bye guys
