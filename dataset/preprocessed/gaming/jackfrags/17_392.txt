i mean you might die thunder's a man [Music] i murdered him well and now we're off believe it or not pubg just turned four years old and the footage that you're watching now is from my first ever pub g video way back in march 2017 and as you can see the game was a lot different back then only one map a few guns and third person only but it was inherently fun and that was the most important thing and really what drew me towards the game the potential to be the first aaa battle royal game that paved the way for so many others like it down the line in those four years though so much has changed although it has remained true to its hardcore simulation style gun play and mechanics from a core gameplay perspective several improvements were made vaulting was added to allow players to traverse the levels with more freedom jumping through windows and climbing over walls that they couldn't before weapon attachments can now be automatically equipped onto your guns when looted without needing to drag them over on the inventory screen eringel the first map in the game was enhanced several times with new points of interest and updated graphics the gliders were definitely my favorite addition though there's a bike down there adam i see that is ridiculous adam are you serious several other maps were added to miramar set in a vast desert sanhok a smaller more action-packed map that's also been overhauled and improved the candy set in the snow featuring snowmobiles and an abandoned dinosaur theme park carrick in the first pubg map to feature destructible walls and c4 paramo with a volcano dominating the skyline and dynamic elements of the level that change every match and most recently haven a small darker map experimenting with pve and pvp mashed together of course several new guns were thrown into the mix as well like the beryl a devastating fast-firing assault rifle that dominated the meta of the game for a while and also the panzerfaust rocket launcher for taking out any vehicles or armored targets pubg e sports also grew in size two hosting several global events where the best players and teams in the world went head to head with each other fighting for pride pans and prize money along the way and that brings us to today myself two angry gamers and westy jumped back into the game a couple days ago and had a good time reliving some of that tense pubg gameplay finding ourselves having to push up a dangerous hill towards the final zone and i hope you guys enjoyed watching this we had a lot of fun playing it if you do like it leave a like and a comment below
