[Music] hi everyone and welcome to assassin's creed valhalla and a big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this video they let me play the game early for a few hours and right now i think i found some kind of creature at the south of the map there was a tip that there's some kind of big dog roaming around these parts and it looks like someone has already tried to hunt it down and failed so i'm gonna go in here and see what the situation is not sure it's a good idea but someone's got to do it yeah that's a giant dog confirmed the black shark it's a rabid dog it simply must be stopped i immediately regret everything i'm sorry what if i just charge at it no that didn't work time for melee yeah that's right you run wow it was stun attack ruined so i'm going to keep story stuff out of this video not to spoil anything if you want to play the game for yourself but at the moment i've come to this village and i'm gearing up for a raid is that a cat why can i talk to the cat come back here cat let me talk to you can i speak cat is that is that a thing nollie hasn't let anyone touch him since old cutter died okay but he sure loves you do you want to join my crew nolly you would make a fine raider i think what every long ship needs a brave cat for luck and for the rats did i just acquire a cat for the boat is that what's happened i don't see the cat hello gnarly you are settling in well enough where's the camera i don't see the cat oh there he is cat right i've just acquired a a a raid cat i guess a battle cat if only i could give it some armor all right it's my first raid [Applause] go easy on me we've got to get this guy called ruined oh my god wow that's a head clean off stop oh what oh he carried me you're gonna pay for that you get both axes what's this one here oh man oh the tackle into the fence this guy's a bit feisty the stomp is awesome there's a big lad inside here still throwing around a bit he's quite tanky yes oh my god there's another head smack that's full captain america right now that i've murdered everyone i've gotta get to the top of this church thing and blow the horn here we go do it there's my peeps do come in don't mind the bodies oh there just to remind you it's assassin's creed come to join me now after a raid most vikings typically enjoyed meditating with sheep i read that in a history book once as you can see the viking and the sheep are one in sync with each other and now it's time to meditate and all is one with the world everything is at peace traditionally also like to fish quite big though that [Music] it's a cod i was expecting something a bit more exotic than that right in the neck you're next [Music] what does that mean i'm gonna use my raven to distract this guy get him fortunately i've got this giant axe we have to attack berg's castle that lightning in the background man that's awesome just love smashing people to pieces that's what vikings did i'm on fire the throwing axe is definitely my favorite though oh my god what was that all i can think about is how many watermelons do they have to kill to make the sound effects in this game these arches are a pain in the ass damn it oh there we go right more ramming is required second gate let's get through need a bigger run-up push it's quite a big gate to be fair all right the boss man is up there somewhere he's hiding in his little private part of the castle in there somewhere there he is i'm just being pelted by arrows from behind i guess i could just start attacking him from here if i want it harassing with the raven dead he's got a flaming sword though which i'm quite perturbed by back through the fire [Music] that was a cool raid i enjoyed that all the viking brothers are here we've taken over i'll find a pack of wild bears i just want to see if the abilities work on them can i kick a bear i can't tackle a bear that doesn't work this isn't acceptable all right one of them god oh it's gone full revenant there he's one of my bow abilities here didn't i just do that should just deny in the first place i think that will do it for today guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below and once again a big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link in the description with that said if you did like it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
