going to build some cool stuff best weapon is the workbench go ahead danny get cozy with it let's take a crack at those weapons offense but your battle rifle is a little basic let's fix that rule number nine always use the right tool for the right job in this case it's gunpowder and scraps i can change the optic the muzzle and the ammo sometimes i lie awake at night asking myself juan how can you kill people faster later the answer is soft target rounds heavy damage against unarmored targets excellent danny now you can pop enemy flesh like a ripe watermelon okay let's look at your other rifle let's say your target remember to wear their helmet and best today you're gonna need some armor piercing round these rounds fly straight and through and go through kevlar like [ __ ] through a goose oh i see nice now you got your own supply of high velocity war crime that's fine let's look at your attachments time to make your very first suppressor this will turn a bang into a bang at the cost of some range lose a bit of range but how easy that was now you can silently headshot your enemies like a real [ __ ] the workbench is your friend danny a friend with benefits damn making [ __ ] is addictive with that workbench you can build a new yard so i've got soft and armor piercing rounds now one of a kind very funny so i've got to get materials and i can also use animals to trade for materials also the hunting you ready he's got a quest danny i've got big plans for you but first i need you to get a thing for me now i hear you ask one what is this thing you need all you need to know is don't try to eat it talk to it or put it in your pants but one i hear you ask where is this thing you need head for the radial tower and follow the trail north it'll take you to an abandoned camp on the east side of the island i can mark it on your map you'll meet my contact there she'll hook you up and danny you pull this off i'm gonna give you something for pulling me from the bottle a little gift an old friend gave me for saving his life not that you saved my life just i get the [ __ ] out of here easy as smoking a cigar on sunday don't eat it and don't put it in your pants it's 1200 meters away is that a horse horse can i pet the horse good horse that's a nice looking horse can guapo jump on the horse with me [ __ ] i haven't ridden a horse since basic training don't think so go a bit faster with the sprint oh man it's all broken down here watch out for the soldiers i had some music on what's that tower up there that's where we're headed said a tractor living a good life dude unless you got a horse see i've been through enough of them in esperanza clear the checkpoints destroy the billboards and watch that rise from the ashes checkpoints you see now see a soldier there should we clear this one i think we should gotta take out that alarm got an alarm there soldier there checkpoint better be careful oh hi good job i had the suppressor i didn't even see that dude that guy is heavily armored bet this place has a stash room i like this gun there's a key here [Music] in here yeah just bursts in there adorable happy families oh a sniper rifle so do i just have to blow that up maybe we got it slow motion crocodile [Music] and we flipped it for the revolution now we control it now and there's a cowboy what do you want i'm on the phone the checkpoint is clear

guy oh mike just threw a molotov at the it's a nice black horse though that i'm still uh you're a good horse now oh you kicked me off instantly that was rude do you think it knows i think it knows excuse me lady it's okay relax it's all friendly around here now no need to worry you climb up it juan i found the tower don't stop now danny find the career path and follow it to my contact see i'm on my way i mean there's got to be something up here [Music] there's a crate and some boots so do they automatically get applied then or do i have to switch them foot gear i think if you get something that's higher level it just puts it on automatically i did get a sniper rifle too oh nice oh man place is huge [Music] it's a weird symbol on the map though here comes trouble my name is ryza and i'm going to be helping you steal [ __ ] from castillo today are you going to tell me what i'm stealing depleted uranium erdogan i thought you just said uranium you heard me look all i know is i burned my last contact in the army tracking it down for juan ux military isn't everybody okay just show me where it is first you take this parachute trust me it can save your life now i'll take you to the old spanish fort they've got it locked up inside parachute excellent keeper conscript or volunteer conscript my number came up so i did my time you volunteer all i wanted to be was a soldier you know wear the uniform serve my country found out the only kind of soldier castillo wants is a blind fascist addicted to his every word so now you're a traitor yeah and i'm not the only one there's a guard posted at the watchtower ahead he's going to let us use it to scout out the fort he can also give us useful info what does he want from us one not to get his ass shot so keep your gun holstered or he'll open fire two a little bribe to these double agents will get us military intel right no weapons pesos ready bribing double agents some soldiers are double agents and have valuable intel interesting there he is hope you got some pesos on you i've always got pace or something tell me what you know okay check this out here's where you can find some weapons around here gracias you put a cash on my mouth whatever you and ryzen are about to i don't wanna be around for him oh i can just kill him if i want everyone's got a good price not every soldier is a fanatic some are just trying to feed their families just remember to put the guns away before you approach them i have to be careful then i don't want to scare any away just smoking a cigarette casual i'm going up use your phone to scout out enemy soldiers and see their weaknesses i bet juan's already giving you his right tool for the right job talk yes he has several times i'll use my phone there's the officer in charge alvarez has the key to the armory careful danny he's higher rank in castillo's army that means he's better trained quicker with the trigger and a tough [ __ ] so there's about five in there this fort is the most protected base on the island these soldiers have been issued with body armor and helmets nothing armor piecing rounds can't handle use the workbench if you need to craft some and then go snatch that uranium danny that parachute i gave you could come in handy here just don't drop into the middle of the point okay so i think i've already got armor-piercing rounds on my secondary that one let's have a look can i put them on my primary weapon it's got soft browns on i could switch it and have i got enough for the sniper rifle no it doesn't look like it okay so i've got two weapons there that i've got armor piercing rounds those [ __ ] hate me pretty hard don't call easy i'm one that's suppressed let's do this there is a cave entrance down there i wonder if i could go down there there's a pup there too by the looks of it what's that enemy here just in case all right we'll dive in turns all around that was it's a bad cave how's that enemy there save my ammo it's locked need a key for that some parts here i feel like it's going to be really important to collect everything that i can is security cameras don't give me away oh did you see the crocodile found the armory uranium is inside locked going to need a key i'll be on the big guy won't it up here got him i think guapo gave me away then or maybe it was just my incompetence the key they should get me juan's uranium excellent grappa was just chilling next to him [Music] there it is someone's crying gunpowder juan you didn't [ __ ] tell me i was stealing uranium it was supposed to be a surprise now bring it back to me what if this [ __ ] kills me stop being such a [ __ ] it's fine no big deal oh very satisfying getting those headshots let's head back then i wonder if we can get a boat or something there's a power station there got to come from that way i would say that was a successful mission didn't raise the alarm didn't really take any damage i'd love it if there was a boat though a rib boat or something would be cool what's apache horse let's go let's go horse that's a good horse ah hello hey guerillas i think [Music] mongoose [Music] oh my god that was a bit unnecessary i just wanted to pet the dog all that dog come here good boy good boy that's all i do in this game i just pet things now horse my horse is gone i know he's over here of course i thought i'd lost you danny you got the uranium i can call for a horse change the coat oh my horse customization look at this blue done pinto chestnut oh spotted cedar i'll go for the blue i like that one i don't want to know what he's
