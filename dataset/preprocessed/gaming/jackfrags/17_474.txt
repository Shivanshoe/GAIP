[Music] hello everyone and welcome to more call of duty warzone today playing with study westy and the tactical brit and we're going to be using the season one meta loadouts today so we're just gonna quickly go over those we've got the dmr 14 and the mac 10 so this is how i've got the dmr built you can change that to a three times if you want so if you want to go ahead and copy this do feel free and also for the mac 10 i've got the gallantry skin which gives you the different iron sight and the only thing that i might change here is the muzzle some people like to use the socom eliminator to get rid of some of that recoil but i like the agency suppressor just to remain off that mini map so that's what we're going to be using today should be a good time got a nice group to play with today also they did just add a load of stuff to the store you can get a christmas woods if you want and if you guys do pick up anything in the store consider adding my creator code jack frags and anything

that mark was marked red there was one on the top of the uh one here too i was the mounted guy who looks up yeah the guy on green now that was where the mounted light was clear down here yeah your stuff's good yeah your stuff's good you're all right that's coming right in front of them oh just in case uh where's my stuff going oh i think i just caught an air strike right oh my god no no i think i did it wrong i did it right now [Music] i'm over here down the end just above me on this hill guys guys above me there's a guy down just about there could be someone in these buildings then oh my god i threw the trophy all the way through the head oh yeah there's someone in the building there's someone in there there's two there's two over here i mean it's kind of too good isn't it is that such a thing it's kind of too good i'm i'm going to run all the way around can i yourself for us have you got your loadouts done i do have my load up i'd love to get the other one again oh my god oh he's got me he's got me he sniped you yeah i think i might be able to get to you i might just get to you i'll try and get down focus on fighting lucky yeah oh no i might get supposed i'm gonna keep crawling down the stairs you might be able to get me like also i don't know i don't know i'm coming let's okay hold on we still dude it's taking me ages to get up here i'm going to stay in this kitchen here almost down one night jail break jailbreak come back for free jack you could um this is crazy what the hell is this game oh jailbreak imminent i think they have dmr's as well by the way yeah right should we be able to bail back down on your position i think we can try and barrier i think we should go we should run get the helo and go yep go go go come on that's fine dodging bullets i'm in the matrix now boys oh jack you've got enough for a loadout yeah yeah could be people there can be people there we don't even have a buy station here though please get getting your help go please yeah yeah i'm just making sure please little tip here guys if you're watching you don't have to go into this building to get that ammo you can just jump and get it like that so just spam the use button and you get it that way are you still leveling your dmr jackpot no no it's max michael sweet uh money here for nine grand total and then we'll get uav [Applause] as well i've got i've got a key card by the way guys so we could go for another bunker third bunker yes yes you want to do it well i mean let me run that one on the airport there's a new one at airport [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] down i did put an airstrike on it [Applause] i'll finish don't finish it i got it i got it thank you one of you want any how the hell did he melt how did they dress both of them instantly i don't know um i didn't get any downs with the airstrike either so they raised them all too quick they raised them has anyone got any uh cameras yeah it goes forward thank you [Music] [Applause] they jumped off they're going back up i can't believe they've done this ah he's got the dmr he's landing like headshots instantly it's taking everything yeah um i've got no armor plates neither is studded i do i do i can drop some uh we shouldn't take this fight we shouldn't do this they seem pretty good players as well you can get an angle on them no no because they're just landing headshots for the dmr every single time so it's so overpowered that gun totally fair and balanced [Applause] how do we get away just run all the way cowboy boys we should just go south towards storage maybe or we don't have the further away we get the less accurate shots are going to be the seats back dmr it's fun i think it's like here mr i mean it's basically uh yeah i mean the guy was just spamming at the vehicle basically semi-auto 98 yeah and it's completely broken and there's no [Applause] there's no way we can take him out [Applause] and look lackey fired all those dmr shots they hit you instantly how does that work i'm not entirely sure how i missed those they've got the best they've got the best position because the whole of their body is protected we need uh being nerfed about next week yeah as soon as raven come back in the office they're like hey turn down that pedal [Applause] loving your work i mean where's the rest of the server that's what i want to know they're all hiding it might have been yeah down at from at promenade it's not a bad strat to be honest if you get a whole squad in there with dmrs and you've got munitions boxes ow they hate us they hate us and you guys actually we're just rinsing each other's plates at this point yeah yeah everyone can get it and we're currently out and we're currently getting it i don't know i reckon we should go up to damn yeah that's probably a good idea we'll get beaten by down there won't we can we not drive i mean yeah we drive around with our shoes and kill us i mean we'd have to wait for them to be outside we could usually get to down i think without them doing much damage to us i'm just going to run over this one on a moving target yeah they go that way because uh jackie's got the most wanted anyway so that's the only thing people are going to know exactly where yes of course it's gone right towards them we could get that helo if you wanted damn we've got time together is there much point i don't think we do know i mean we might have enough time the only i think we go all the way around back to police station again and go to like the you know the big crossroads of the motorway i'm blue okay i think we go all the way around yeah i mean you might be better off i just think avoiding avoiding their their gaze is the best thing physically within airport is probably our best show [Applause] i think wait where's that coming from driver there's big pp behavior though that's a big plan it won us they want us it's fine i think [Music] [Applause] right i'm gonna try i'm gonna try this you ready it's gonna be risky oh you've jumped it was too risky oh god oh god get out it's gonna blow aboard mission aboard it you'll make it you're making it effective you're going inside airport yeah yeah that's probably our best shot yeah bounty contract from behind oh god uh what the hell there's a girl they're rough on that oh they were camping the roof watching it the entire time oh here it is nice one um wait have you got you got the vehicle unlocked lucky outside right outside yeah on your level on your level yep he's going back then i'm gonna sell press don't worry about me do you not worry about me surprising i'm right around the corner ah i threw two stones and they just owned me yep just the roof [Applause] probably just waiting there with his mac 10. you've got one more stun lacquer you'd not you'd be able to find out is there one more in there i'm gonna hold it yeah there's one more at least we have to move i'm gonna i need to get those plates hold up if i can beat him if i put my gun around the corner he's not shooting i've got to reload this yeah they're not in here they're not either there they've moved they've moved out down and broke one they're just waiting ahead somewhere we have to move to them remember so perfect positioning by the way lucky well done hey watch out they'll be waiting one thing i'm good at with battle royales patience he's low he's low not peeking anymore there's still a bounty up there though oh you got the heartbeat should be good well done that's the bounty as well they're probably above you they're probably above you yeah 100 100 above they're on the roof because there was that team that killed me they were literally on airport roof the full roof we've got a nice little angle here i don't think they can hit us here it lasts i've got my key card back [Music] oh it was me trying to use the ffa round i'm just gonna use the dmr for the rest of the i think [Laughter] nice try nice try that was a that wasn't that was a that was a competitive first one yeah yeah very very competitive very good right update the dmr loadout [Laughter] would you look at that we left for a whole three days and now everyone's using it blown away [Laughter] guys watching the stream thank you for tuning in today that was an exciting first game right there that was absolutely action-packed all sorts going down plenty mac 10 kills couple dmr kills in there unfortunately everyone is running the the dmr now so welcome guys welcome i hope you all had a great christmas evolo carter how are you doing sean warrior80 what's up gg is there ggs

hours today explosive first match today i loved it really enjoyed that and if you're interested in the meta loadout that i'm using i did show that at the start of the video with the stream and you can skip back and have a look if you're interested what that is dmr should be illegal maybe what we got here p90 i'm just gonna kill myself i need to level those cold war guns up cold or mp5 that'll do oh that guy just planted maybe he's doing the same thing i'm doing there's a lot of recall on it compared to the automotive it bounces around like crazy i think it's got a high rate of fire though than the modern warfare fb5 what's up jose hannigan welcome the grind begins yes indeed hey steve thank you for the five sigma what's up how you doing the first frag stream really enjoyed your bf4 content years back yeah bf4 was good times it was good times dmr hits harder than a car night yeah it feels like that tricky yeah it does uh broad thank you for the one right game number two can we do this our screen is black that's fine we're gearing up apparently battle royale can you see the plane please are we going to train why are you training actually i mean i haven't landed on the train in about 84 years okay have you not done the recon strike yet jack no what's the reconstruct you sit on the train and the recon flag just keeps respawning so then you just get infinite zones on your minimap so you know exactly where the end circle is but does the point that you have to capture appear on the train as well yeah every time yeah what yeah it's ridiculous it's completely stupid totally fine and balanced we're the only team here i think let's get it done don't take the ammo yet not yet or do we just get the flag straight away yeah get it straight away and then it will appear on the back of the flag it actually appears on the train yeah yes what the hell sun sun god stays in the sky above where you activated so you don't even get like hunted basically yeah so look the the sun god is behind you jack look so he just stays there i have a sniper and there we go and then what you can do is you can just sit inside and wait to come out again and uh stodd can jump off at the nearest vehicle drive ahead go get the loadout yeah cause starts already got 17 and a half okay we've got 17 grand two ginger crates crazy and this is a legit tax it's not even an exploit not even an exploit it's legit are we going for that buy then oh no no i'll do it i'm gonna drop some money on them i've got money on the train sorry guys my money's going everywhere my pockets are just too fast floyd mayweather over here right the the flag is back so just do it again yeah do it again drop off the side jump in get it now it's on the train well this is silly isn't it yeah no this is how you win games jack because now look at your mini-map this is what's called an oversight [Applause] [Applause] oh yeah you could have been winning all those games jack and and it's taking you this long i know right all right tennessee land on the train that's the rule no that won't work surely no i don't know technically well far ahead of us this is literally a replay of the video i just posted i'm not kidding this is exactly the same as what i've just did you win the match cameron yeah we did we won it as well we just went and found the final zone and you know we didn't camp we just you know um is this gonna work wait it's tactically where did you put it stop get right and get to the front of the train it gets to the front it's gonna like break it no no then you get you get your m14 load up back on the train totally fair legal and then you get your weapon xp as well for completing that can we just do this every week any place yeah but we're gonna go out of the zone now oh no there's a car the car's on the side of the train it's gonna blow up oh no no run rate i mean that is a horrible final zone right there people fighting in front of us yeah on the on the plane on the plane he just did a crab sliders i think that was weird crap right now my maths isn't great but i'm pretty sure we won't make it back into the circle with the train nice the dmr beam dude we're gonna do the flag one more time flag one more time one more time go go go go go go [Applause] oh in front of us there's two of them in there one in the window one window side oh god oh my god look at the map we already know exactly where the final zone's gonna that's not so bad we could just have that building oh i got sniped from behind it's okay oh i'm all good is that from the plane yeah i killed them yeah no planes down playing sound different team uh lucky's got one guy at playing i need a red baby yeah i see the sniper behind us yeah we got hit from purple he's there he's in that building vehicle can somebody get munitions hang on a minute hang on let's check the vehicle watch that sniper because he's still looking at us he's there he's right there somebody get munitions as well guys someone else has just got their loadout oh it's over there getting a cell phone [Applause] do we go in the hole in the hole somewhere [Music] nice [Applause] [Applause] we should just tag team yeah just don't you might get it oh look he got me quick he's in the window get to the right can't get to the rock i'm not so keen on our position i think we should move somewhere enter the hole into the hole let me get in the hole again again hello hello we can't enter the hole now oh that's close [Music] can we please go in the hole yeah i want to go no i would like to see the hole we don't have a key card you don't need a key card [Applause] there's a squad coming down the hill down the hill yeah yeah we must protect the hull protect the hole right to the hole be advised [Applause] you've gotta move from greenwood we're at the hole we're at the hole okay that team on the right is going to have to run to us okay okay sniper snipers we're in the hole [Applause] down oh my god this thing is insane one last guy here uh on this mark on blue behind the rock he's like from the valley belly valley get him coming uav over here he's behind the back what happened right he's there right there

in the hole god damn it i'm already in the hole get in the hole i'm going down the hole can i get in there you can get [Applause] there's too many i cannot get in the hole anymore [Applause] if you go to the other end of the hole um there's the escape the escape hole this game are they gonna be waiting up here is that a tighter hole yeah i would come i would say this is much more claustrophobic okay okay as far as holes go yeah i didn't even realize i didn't know there was a second exit look we're inside that we're inside there why don't i don't feel good about anything that we're doing right now but it is what it is you know we're gonna take it as it comes this whole seems to have a lot more cut than the other hole oh definitely uh [Applause] hit loads of times broke again broke

building frankie benny's thank you benny's i'll start dropping don't see him i think i've decided i've decided to revert to my natural habitat what's that he'll find out he's a basement right purple purple there's a guy in there oh yeah there's also a guy on blue roof he was in the little cubby hole on the top there was a guy on blue there was definitely a guy on blue does anybody can i get to yours well you can it's nice you might just make it oh god as soon as you left me underneath us underneath thank you i'm not beating again oh my god they're in the building do not because they've got a head shot on us now we'll just have to wait until the end zone this is horrific i hate this so much this is insane this is actually insane oh no no no no no no i think we have to go bank building jack you want to go back can we make it yeah i think so well camera guys they've just broken my shield they broke the shield he's not he's up he's up so if he doesn't have a semtex we're being sniped from orange oh my god um how do we do this i've got no plates by the way you got any yeah there's two guy here no full headshot instantly one frame yeah here we go here we go and look oh i already

then helping them oh this guy here yeah his name is yeah i'm looking through the through the teams now well then i mean we'll do one more let me just see him i just want to see if he gets a kill he knows there's someone in there fell's besties got 20 kills yeah he's not even he's oh look at that look at that into the building and then think he was in this room and he wasn't there dude this guy's movement what is he doing looking into walls yeah yeah general the only plus side of people who are cheating is i just love the fact that we can block this guy yeah and we never have to play against him again i might block all of his teammates as well yeah because they're looking a bit um no these teammates are fine yeah but if we block them then we won't ever play with the guardian i know where you are hopefully you get down you can get down now that'd be amazing look it's shooting through the wall yeah he's full chain but he knows exactly where everyone is look that's got eight people he's down is he killed by another cheater but i wonder how many kills this guy has because he just headshotted everyone as well [Music] what was that guy's name bestie and the other guy was trx well thanks thanks the other i love being associated there's a lot more people with fb gg in there in their names recently i've noticed yeah maybe because of the pandemic loads more people have just started streaming i wouldn't be surprised streaming and weirdly you get a lot more views on facebook weirdly yeah i wonder why very weird um right around him okay go yeah he's on the right hand side next to a guy with a he's like yeah he's got a default logo as well with some arrows yeah yeah lebron stinky he was part of his team so block him um yeah i was talking about him you remember uh i don't actually know who else was in that team i i can actually i can look at the file i can look at the file two of them will be enough if they're partying together yeah yeah should be fine who else will be watching lebron stinky those guys all caps i'm just gonna block him because he head shot the cheetah so trx got his mate yeah trx that guy just i mean he might be legit but i'm not gonna risk it don't risk it for a bit uh the rest of the guys in that game one was called jay's i think his name was yeah that's fine we got we got him we're good ladies and gentlemen we got him we got him [Laughter] geez wow well that was another crazy game up on that roof was pretty horrible wasn't it yeah when that guy killed me the first time i was a bit suspicious but you never know with aim assist i mean in the kill cam though it did look like he just like completely tracked my head i'm always reluctant to say someone's cheating straight away when you know the kill cam could be a bit dodgy but it did look suspicious um but i think based on the second time he killed and then just spectating him that guy was definitely cheering 100 you never you can never get rid of him uh tumus jack bf6 will be world war ii modern or future what's your guess i would guess modern if you think that they've done two historic games in a row they've done bf1 and bf5 and what a lot of the audience just want a modern shooter don't they so i think it's the the obvious bet safe bet based on the popularity of war zone as well i think dice would be uh would be making a mistake if they didn't make a modern game um ace of spade thank you for the five thoughts on the mp5 it's it's good i just think the mac 10 beats it now uh we've got some new members as well chicken ed thank you very much uh jordan thank you the donation jag happy holidays from missouri jag twenty dollars man that's very kind of you thanks hope you had a nice christmas mate a gym jam thanks for the five always use my creator code when you get a chance that's very kind of you well i consider doing private match lobbies yeah i would say probably not but maybe in the future we'll see we'll see uh liv and jack thank you for the two merry christmas dave thank you for the ten pounds very kind i'll spend that on a nice costa gh thank you for the donations and hollow do you think games should start skipping the middle man to report and just allow the community members to ban people with video evidence hello um i don't know if you know how the overwatch system in csgo works because that's kind of what happens there so if someone gets reported so many times in in counter-strike they get put into the overwatch match pool and then you have an option on your menu every player has the option i think when they get to a certain round canal is played but you can review demos of people that have been reported so you watch the replay back and then you submit a result at the end and say okay this guy was probably cheating or this guy was maybe cheating and then eventually if they receive so many overwatch reports and it's quite obvious they'll get banned so games are already doing that and i think a system like that would work great for warzone and modern warfare it's just i don't know if they've got the tech to implement that in the game because this game doesn't have replays does it so they'd have to do a lot of work and i don't see it as being a priority for infinity ward and raven it should be a soldier i don't know i don't think it would happen yeah i agree with you i think it's a good deterrent for cheetahs [Music] two pumps thank you for the five you doing this train again literally get on the train and then hide and go and get my pizza i put in the microwave microwave pizza yeah i don't know about that camera no no it's from last night i'm a woman oh that's right that's just about to say you seem [Music] i got him [Applause] it's time for gucci mane right i'm hiding on the trailer there's the guy on green there's the guy in green he's on the end of the train really yeah if he jumped off one of them yeah shield lads i've obtained the pace we've already got enough for a loadout if you want me to

on the train if you need to this train game please do to me objective updated oh they got their loadout over there to the northeast love how when you run backwards on the train you're literally running the spot yeah it's so weird it's quicker to jump off the train i'll jump off the side and run teammates i mean we can buy here guys we can buy here we've got another it's too late because you won't need a big one we need a vehicle yeah you want to get to that i'm gonna go for this one and i'll drive it back i guess all right i think i'll make it i don't know oh how does that happen i just

here would you play in a tournament nah not really i'm not really that uh competitive with this game i don't think the tournaments are particularly fair as well because of the way the uh the lobbies work with with console controllers and vpns and all that i think we're just going ham on these guys down that shaft yeah i think rusty got it moving relocating behind us you several rides this is double rest i need to sell ammo you got it there he is coming in down that's right i'm taking that [Applause] cluster striking coming i got self-res gonna get our munitions back come on hoping you get

down bucky i'm gonna come up i'm gonna come up to you sweetie you've been sniped i'm here i'm coming up to you i'm gonna come up to you provide some cover we can both hold the roof together that will stand a better chance so there's still orange and purple on orange and purple yeah i'm gonna go help westy oh god next building over that's [Applause] good job guys that was quite chaotic can we survive there i think he's running across he's gonna go ride good nice and jam enemy uav overhead as it's definitely probably using the new cheat gun a blue sheet somebody's just raised right next to

running dmr i'm running i'm running dmr all right you're a better person than we are yeah and not we got a lot of cash we could buy something i need to get sulphurs yeah me too actually uh the fire station buy is probably safest uh i'd say sorry there was loads of enemy uavs just popping up there i'm gonna go this one oh by the way i've got sachi here if none of you have one body armor vehicle coming towards me on the bike where i am right now on the corner he jumped out cam yeah i think they're on the other side by petrol i think he's staying petrol is someone over bad idea and that's there [Music] in the uav picking up as well another one dropping here he's moving left oh he just got posted by someone who goes hosting with the ghosted a truck four by four coming in uh just bailed out do you see that i'm gonna be above you jack i'm green [Applause] [Applause] i think there was a team ghosted in here cam watch out well there was at least one player let's go together go together clear it ow go on down um [Music] we're chasing someone he's 100 on that yellow roof don't see him don't see him though don't see him hey man he might be coming up might be coming up slow are beating he's still in this building he's still in this building jump in oh on the side of me another one there's another one nice jack where's the other one i got him i got him i got him he ran out after us damn i thought there was another one can we go back to lackey can we go back to lucky did you get the bounty i invaded them enemies enemy droppings uh did he just kill himself he maybe i marked him here running it's missed me okay yeah he's gone oh this guy on the bike on the bike yeah just rest he's like halfway up jack because he's on the level he's gonna go roof yeah yeah yeah you ready yeah ready ready you get him lucky he's going to be here right there the guy who reads this test the uh rez however all right i'm not entirely sure that guy yeah he's broke okay i'm going to buy i'm on the buy another uav going up there's one on the they're both on the roof they're both on the roof one jump down they jump down on the right fire station lackey there's people at fire station god damn it oh these guys on red roof finding you yeah well one's on there one's just jumped off and i might be able to kill the other fire station buy station station yeah i'm looking i'm looking at the back door now looking at that door they're probably trying to get to the buy that's what they're thinking about i have a very [Applause] he's going to tell his friend friendly uav over here fighting they know here they're nowhere yeah yeah oh heart contact here where you're right i think he was just looking down the stairs i'm gonna go the other side yeah i'm the other side already oh nice cam here oh they stunned me they stunned me oh crap oh it's not uh red marker red marker in town downtown oh yeah that's fine don't worry about them they're trying to stun through the gap be careful they're just getting in that building yeah well zones coming don't go in there it's cleared out yeah yeah yeah okay they're gonna run out the bottom so just look down marking new safe zone [Applause] there might be one more there's going to be people below you because that wasn't no no the guy in the building would jack oh he's here see why i'm coming and there's two more teams there's still two in the building with eugene they're just camping at the moment you got my heartbeat uh i've got bottom floor yeah 6.3 meters there's one below me six point three on your side there's one they're gonna they're gonna pinch at the same time i reckon i'm ready here okay i'm watching i'm watching bottom [Applause] there's a team above your blue guys 4.2 meters i think they're either going to pop out or they're going to go bolton they're going to get one you got it absolutely you got it covered son oh stop behind you oh my god what the hell are we going to do is that um [Applause] more from their team let's go right i'm going over sod yeah we're going to stay okay keep going keep going this way keep coming this way we could possibly got one on the roof nice one are they i'm blue are they on blue they're on that blue roof yeah crazy [Music] um i was killing teams over on the fire station to the east and then i in downtown by a bunch of dudes still 11 people left yeah they're all on this roof and then we want to guys guys guys push right side yeah we should go now go down go go go go go okay go it probably will be like a solo on this side somewhere yeah just stick together sit together as we move you'll have a whole team in these buildings here they'll be in police and stuff we've got enough to buy lucky [Applause] they'll surely run out so it's only three teams [Applause] [Applause] yeah we made it we made it let's uh see if we can down one broke one broke a billy going now going now he's got my team down uh behind me though oh my god guys well played well played okay got a hill oh my god oh my god they all had dmas i'm taking their mate that is insane this is absolutely mental where's the last team one last guy inside i think he's around the back towards you yeah he's just broke glass i'm watching you that's me right i mean whoa guys what a game what a game that was crazy wow that was incredible double win that's what you get you get two wins for that round laps can i just say that was absolutely incredible teamwork yeah brilliant that was insane that might be one of the best rounds of war zone i've ever played yeah i mean in terms of movement and teamwork and the whole lot it was great love the train style is the train stretch fun the train strap is what makes it we get that weird bit of chaos at the start i love that we beat those dmi's as well that feels good i think it's the panic was so strong they couldn't even do it damn boy how much damage like oh six thousand damage oh my god well played well done that's damn oh what's that gonna be westing the dmr fourteen war zone ever you won't believe no you will believe the loadout i'm using for this video you'll absolutely understand why we won this game [Laughter] oh dear god the dms were terrifying luckily i think we we traded turtling as much sexy donut is the ebr competitive um it doesn't really have the rate of fire and the the low recoil that the dmr has so no not really i mean uh you can um it will also take sniper ammo one of the reasons that the dmr is so good is just assault rifle ammo what's the biggest mag you can have 20 rounds as well yeah it's not quite as good i do think the dmr will get nerfed though a bit too good at the moment too good ace thank you for the five you think there'll be a loadout in the future that will be easily competitive weapons planes oh against the maximum got the momentum this show can you show field of view settings yeah sure i'm good [Applause] 598 canadian it's good it's just in the current meta it's not that competitive at all really so i think you'd be you'd be putting yourself at a disadvantage if you use it i forgot to put my double xp on again [Applause] i'll level these other guns up it'd be cool to see a burst rifle like the m16 be competitive but i don't think it will be like i don't know what a fully leveled m16 looks like in this game maybe you could spec it so it was good i'm not sure how many more games we'll play a couple more games creek's pretty good joshua it's competitive with the kilo definitely i did a video on the krieg already [Music] hey alex what's up johan hey david fowle foul was good but they nerfed it it was too good you could two shot people with it it was silly battle royale afternoon intron how you doing man how's the jaffa cakes today there's a few left in tron there's a few thank you man yeah we're streaming at 4k in a really high boot rate so it should look good [Music] are we going to train again today look at the luck it gave us last round target probably around the war zone where i could post the full 25 minutes i feel like i don't need to edit it post the entire thing someone was having to go at me in the air there i had to kind of back off a little bit you have to set him straight i don't have a dmr at the moment like you so i think it should be a kill streak you should give people his first weapon come on i get all the unlock points oh ginger crates ginger crate ginger crate going gingy gingee uh i'm gonna activate the recon straight away okay yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i didn't i didn't time it very well you got it oh do you want a fan mask please yes oh no no that's the other famous isn't it no no i don't want that no no [Applause] a little bit well i was more concerned about getting crushed between the uh oh okay primary objective accomplished reconnaissal secured right we got the movie it's going to end down here again it's ending down here too i'll grab this vehicle everyone drop the money on the train what is that lamppost right on the train just in the anywhere yeah i'll do it i'm good i'm getting good next cash thank you very much i mean i haven't got the rest of it at all i might grab this one then i'm trying to think i want to go for this by there wait guys we wait until we get our loadout before we do next recon or just keep doing them so we get them done just keep doing them just keep doing i mean we're all using dmrs which are all entirely leveled up enemy front front of the train crossing the car he just got in the hospital get on the back and do the flag cap dead being murdered from we have problems now we're okay we're up here i'm gonna grab the vehicle they're coming down they're coming down towards this they're gonna come down towards the store let me on let me on oh [Applause] packies i had a load out already over here whatever i'll keep the phone us [Music] i don't think he got on the train guys i think no he didn't he stayed at the bridge he stayed at the bridge he's not sure why why wouldn't he get on the fun train right you guys have to grab your loadout lucky's into the goo lag that's all right stop if you've got the loadout just hold on no no no no no no no i've got one i've got i did it right you can drop on the loadout grab it and then get on the atv and instantly join us again look at that i mean i'm parachuting in so i should get in time yeah the plates i think they went through the train yeah i think your plates went through the train oh i think the place went through the train what do you remember did they go through the train when i think the trains went through the plane give me money give me your money thank you someone doing a recon over there yeah i'll absolutely rinse them come on peek again let's go over oh god my game's got that glitch where it starts flashing white every time i fire the gun drop your gun and pick it back up oh god i'm being pelted on the guys in front of me the hole the hole hit again i'm penned that nice i just got an elim and for tax evasion can i grab the uh flag again guys [Music] leveling up guns baby yeah and lucky's back i'm sure the physics will be okay on this no one in atc is oh yeah coming for the train there we go uh lucky that picking up my weapon didn't work the airplane's in the uh mount your weapon basically it's like some weird thing where your scope mesh just breaks basically atc looks pretty clear if you want to go i don't know if you want to camp up there or whatever just keep doing trying i mean final zone stranger oh god down oh my god that's so silly this guy and that is why i got the play box so silly by the way the play box is here if you haven't used it just dump them inside we've got a little safe space for all of our extra gear oh no one resting oh no this is so scenic i'm loving it you know right guys i think we know where the final circle is going to be it's a train station we can go right we can do it a few more far that's too far we need a vehicle don't we yeah we could just buy another one guys we've got loads of money no i don't think we've got enough blackie so it's train finished i never thought i would care about the train but now i actually care about the shrimp if you ever do solo streams jack here again yeah well there's a really easy way to level up your guns doesn't it yeah [Applause] if you don't plunder everyone knows about it to the next area you can yeah you could just do it solos like uh wesley said it's fine yeah but everyone's doing it that's what i mean everyone usually knows about it but they don't usually do it in the normal video why can i not jump on that yes i will yeah oh my god no you're just thinner than me sorry boss man there you go make sure you get the favorite gun out i'm max level uh [Music] there we go i wasn't max level on the dmr apparently enemy uav right um i think we do one more recon and then we go train station we need to get ghosts as well yeah look at oh my god look at train we can just go slowly that's so silly it's chasing us it wants us throw one on the back oh okay by the way playing playing supply shoppers as well what i didn't even know i'm down again down again okay okay hang on i love the fact that you don't like glitch under this or anything you just stay on it it's quite nice it's actually very well one more record everyone gets to the show everyone gets the recon they're probably gonna try and drive on us again yeah no they're trying their trucks gone tomorrow oh my god i mean absolutely us don't they they do and there's a king there's a king okay okay right again you should jump off [Applause] again we're leaving should i get a loadout uh yeah yeah get everything you want oh yeah absolutely what's our percentage increase on the next set of contracts because like doing a bounty right now is going to get us like a billion pounds uh yeah but we're one trillion dollars oh yeah oh yeah yeah perfect i've got a plate box as well imagine if this was the only way into this underneath oh slowly crawl yeah over here moving on oh my god we literally know nearly every zone yep we know exactly so we sit here yeah we know the second one we know the next one so we we literally sit there and we win the game and we just part of the game if we get there though i mean we need to get to that point jack where's the confidence check cautious optimism is not advised that's okay it's a false end or nothing another recon oh my god i mean this is just mental how is this a thing like why is this a thing let's ask that question it's just to create like a hot spot action isn't it i think the more people know about it but then they added it to the train and that completely goes against the process i mean the fact that it's on this one it's you know they've done it so it creates uh i don't know it incentivizes people to come over and fight i suppose but the problem is that the flare doesn't stay on the train like you said so if it did then that would be way better and if it made the train horn yeah i actually really love the um breakouts from firestorm it's the one thing that was like a really cool idea oh for the vehicles yeah yeah that was cool i think that's where more zone got the idea for the contracts we can just stay on the roof again this down the road again yeah no there's a guy shooting there i'm not sure where but oh yeah figure i'm green yeah on the red ridge green ammo someone just uh parachuted in and they got beamed back at this so here's the crazy thing i'm pretty sure the zone actually finishes in front of us bounces here yes it finishes it finishes here then it bounces to us here where we are right how long does it take to bounce because if we have four gas masks can we just sit here i think you'll be able to i think you'll end up killing yourself we could stay on the roof though that's the thing we're okay if we have i'm pretty sure it goes here first and then to that roof yes where you are now stodd is where it goes we'd have to control that yeah does anyone need plates by the way are we all good i've got we could destroy one of these sniper looking at us all right let's swing back around let's swing back around nice it ends up like moving loads anyway right yeah yeah they'll come back towards us if we shoot as it comes back whole team on [Applause] here comes the chopper we should get them loads of gear well we they're literally right there yeah right over here still there keeping his head down one guy in here is on the right it's worried about her yeah he's playing you can get him cameron probably oh my god that was so he was trying to be like bb another one just over there wesley on the other side you should be down right here and purple moving here right down right there on purple nice one that one last one last one we've got three down they messed the round what are they doing they're just running up there they they were meaning around they thought they were being like me me we weren't i don't know where this their fourth guy is did you have an advanced uav or did you just pop through it i just popped through okay that's fine right is team coming in behind us over here there's armor boxes gas masks ammunitions boxes all here yes yeah i parked it for us team here on blue going onto the hill oh yeah i've got 25 grand what do you want to do with that [Applause] um that's the last guy i think that's the last guy i'll finish okay [Applause] the he's climbing up he's climbing up he's down there's another one on that bridge oh threw the sticky at the wrong place oh man just let me use my airstrike goddammit that might have been my fault yeah [Music] he's got the money [Music] they'll fight for a chance to redeploy there's still a team over there right yeah there's still a guy on the top yeah yeah just focus on living jack we're waiting for opponents i'm just going to hold the roof here i'll uh try and make you laugh a little bit easier here friendly uav over here well you've got lots of monies so if you can get safe and get a shot i just respawned here parachuting in yeah i think he's just looking for me i see him he's in the air nice one there's still another one down by the bridge ground level i think middle middle middle middle he just mounted and just stayed there oh what in the world you're kidding me no an entire ghosted team just pushed me i feel like i want to get out of here now though because we're being surrounded that ghostly team is going to come on the roof where are they jeff uh they were over by where lacrime died um just kind of here orange yeah i'm driving my lowly i think i don't know it should be good there's stud underneath my gears up there that's my gear there stud what the hell let me grab if we dmr if we combine cash dodd we can get a respawn well well i do think they're just underneath us in the train station yeah respawn over there ah that would be the team that murdered me coming in below vehicle vehicle coming in vehicles oh my god jack it's behind you behind you jack i'm wrestling yeah there's people on your roof with you jack i'll try and cover you but they're literally [Applause] yeah i mean stunning if i can they're not

recently cam about a minute and a half ago these guys were lit okay so you're telling me i can run there buy some players run back and i'll be absolutely fine um with zero consequences absolutely no consequence to it okay there's a player here i don't know if he got it right now he's shooting him with a pistol so probably not cluster on me i got killed there we go just gonna wait inside until the rainy cluster has gone away there we go [Applause] yeah me is the answer there they're beaming you're lacking trying to they're not very good at it i will be honest [Applause] that's the deal there's one one [Applause] not sure what you mean by that corner they're up on that roof as well on trump right here [Applause] oh they're on that corner there there must be more in this team there's no way there's literally two of them what about him hang on hang on what steps on me right here they said something right here i'm moving i'm watching outside outside he's running back to you nice thank you for the mark i think i want to dive down there right here just across the valley in the valleys in the valley you guys have got to come this way yeah yeah is it going it's going to end still on trump they jumped from trump yeah my weapons are still here he's got the bolt action i don't really want to get to the safe zone where is he trump i'm seeing the molded action he's looking at me working rally boy let's go baby bro heading in yeah you gotta move guys you gotta move nope at least i've got my guns back that was lovely nice work our way through here nice and quick is it zip line up and parachute off is that how this works yeah yeah actually that's exactly how it works i'll drive [Music] enemy soldiering coming just got the uh notification nice jack that's the guy that we carried a few seconds ago yep must have had his ghoulie and come back [Applause] [Music] [Applause] relocating just glitched out for me i can't pay you stuff you won't let me paint me like your french girls no maybe take that one oh renee now that's him see you guys what are we doing fire [Applause] oh why did i run around the front like that we played against mercutio already he didn't want yeah are they still behind us on green did you kill them all i killed one of them i think they might back off but they might first we don't know all right is that your trophy no i don't know whose troop he knows i can hear him running around that boat i can actually hear his footsteps somehow right there hello over here [Applause] behind you behind you that's that sounded like yeah destroyed it's probably gonna push me now i'm watching the door yeah yeah yeah there we go [Music] your teammate was sent to the gulag they'll fight for a chance to redeploy did you have money stud um yes i did he's probably taking it [Applause] oh there's people in all of these buildings yep you ruined this guy here [Applause] if you survive start i would not recommend coming back here right the bye [Applause] having a good old fight those guys have got to move i'm going to come back okay so uh well maybe i don't know [Music] i think one of these [Applause] they're really low in there that squad sorry don't i wouldn't drop there at all do i try and hold in the sky holding the sky holding the sky you'll get a load out in a minute about literally five seconds i think trying to capitalize on that fire i couldn't quite do it five seconds you know either yeah it will come in a minute come in there it is there's one other back yeah i'm going for the mattress it's called horrible metal loadout there's an upstairs to this building stud if you want it [Applause] hey uh [Applause] been in there they are upstairs they are upstairs peeking doors and everything we've got dms the list you can't beat him i bet they all have there's just one i think you only you got no plates so i think if i can't you're fighting from here i'll win if he gets any closer i'll die two semtex as well remember you must know that there's an outside door i do and be aware there's the team in on green as well i think he's got ghost which is why he's got dmacc's because he can take it so yeah there's at least one un-ghosted person in green ah i have to stay down here let's have a push up that makes him even more powerful as a secondary yeah yeah you take him on a ghost class oh he's running around oh more people in this building someone's pushed him uh i thought that i thought i was far enough away to maybe not take the damage unlucky dude look at these dmrt's man yeah the diameters dmr's [Applause] that's a good attempt right start do our party lead i'll do one more game then i gotta go all right uh but you don't wanna watch the uh dmrc dmr war the dmr off the deal the dmrt who's got the bigger days this guy's got one i mean he screwed in there in that barn that's literally his head why isn't he shot him i don't think it is i'm pretty sure that was the down guy's head this guy's actually using a kilo oh my god what a legend call that fast reload he's dead that guy yeah yeah he's gasping on repeat maybe it was his head because i can't see anything this is this is such good games i guys here's a let's go yeah all right go go go right i'm just going to quickly um disconnect well i'm going to take a concord give me one second you're taking a concord area he's coming back he's coming back all right it's a is double weapon xp on at the moment by default no no and i'm back oh wait no i've got a disconnect i've gotta close the game i'll be two i'm minutes up just gotta use my uk scene you've got one of those teleporters yeah yeah he's just got home i've made it so that whenever i say beam me up scotty it just happens you know zoe that's the sound it makes yeah beam me up darth beam you up nordvpn [Laughter] sponsor me sponsor me please couldn't win that one unfortunately i thought star might clutch it you know it does very good in those kind of situations i need to know if the dmr dear mac doesn't matter combat yeah penny i think it's a bit it's a bit too much isn't it at the moment now dmr i feel like part of it is glitched or something whether it's the barrel or the damage sometimes it just seems to do excessive amounts of damage i don't know what it is that's a fun game though i mean i did get a couple downs there at the end but perhaps i should have just stayed in the house rather than pushing because the team on the left in the barn i knew they were there i just assumed that they wouldn't have anyone covering that angle but they did that screwed me you're living your line adjusting dmr setup so i did show it right at the start but um that's what we're going with you can run it three times if you want as well but i'm just on the 2x for now there's a mac 10. the only change i'd say you could make to this is if you don't want the suppressor you could go for the eliminator because that helps you with some of the recall maybe that's better if you play on controller on mouse there's you know you can control the recall on this so easy it's not very challenging 175 damage per headshot yeah that's pretty mad ace of spade thank you for the two dollars doi silky johnson shard zero thank you for becoming members mark lump thank you for the five how's it going i'm good mate i'm good come anderson thanks again yobo became a new member yobo that's an interesting name a yobo is like a another word for a football hooligan in the uk or at least in the midlands harry thank you for becoming a member and og ludacris ludacris what's up man thank you are you searching for a game here oh i thought you were are we not looking for again i'm back we can go enemy do i need to join you okay no no no no no no we're still doing your meme oh are we okay cool lucky had just forgotten to get on his plane back to london yeah to be fair nearly did get abandoned at gamescom what do you mean what happened uh my train was on the way back to dusseldorf and i was quite severely hungover uh and fell asleep on the train and nearly woke up in paris i nearly woke up in paris i had about three seconds to get off at dusseldorf when i just woken up or i'd uh yeah would have gone to paris did you have a suitcase just the bag yeah i had i had bags i had everything it was mental hey look you could have always gone to disneyland or visited the eiffel tower it wouldn't have been so bad i probably would have just kept bumping trains till i got back are really nice man i mean if you live near london obviously not in the moment but like we've been we've been to paris a couple times on the eurostar it's really comfy it's just two hours you know and then you're there in paris technically makes more sense as well because like if you get a flight to paris and you have to go early get through security do all that nonsense there is security at some pancreas for the euro tunnel but it's nothing like being at an airport it's very fast yeah you don't have to get there ridiculously early or anything well jack with my uh irish passport i'll be making good use of it you got your nationality huh if you got dual nationality yes i do so you you're still part of

think jack [Applause] one further left as well this is the problem [Applause] daddy someone else has killed him okay having a fight out there i think pushing either towards the loadout probably from hangers i'd guess moving on the place kim break him out the front on the red marker yeah he's probably gone inside white building now eyes on i'm coming down and get our ghost leg on that's the dmr i think that's yeah demo get right here right here on orange parking rally boy i'm gonna grab ghost let's move left i think if we want to stay alive yeah they're in the hangar in hangar and that's probably when they walk into your bullets you just painted the card with them all right is there a way for us to politely get the hell out of here i'm just looking ahead towards over here because sometimes people hang out here you okay on your own over there lucky i'm doing fine it's a light breeze uh the breeze is stupendous [Applause] 21 degrees uh there's a munitions box here i've got a plate box as well if we need it i've got money what's the strike here mark some gear silence mark some gear just happened there shooting up here these two buildings you didn't have to park me off you're right there's a guy in fire station cracked with a demo i mean he might be playing you've got one he's got one uh no he's gonna go with the truck i'd bet most people are not smiling you i could 38 meters yeah he's still in fire station there's just one guy yeah just one camper sniper top of the hill all the way over here sniper team how do you shoot people intro taking shots all right well uh i said we'd get across the ice lake um i think there was someone in atc as well people everywhere ahead of us like on that red mark top of the hill there's a sniper team how many vehicles are on blue and those two rezzes right and left okay guys we're in a little bit of a sticky situation i think we'll be all right there cameron you know [Applause] yeah we've got sophistication jack i think we're going to make it by the tip of our dingo just about that way boy okay i think yeah i think we'll make it let's be fair if we thought us where about you player above you tango [Applause] brexit and that i know it's opie but it's so satisfying when you get kills like that how have i got seven kills already how has that happened oh yes sir pellington has been helping me get some kills does it feel faster with the uh absolutely it does no it feels slower it's definitely not but the thing is i'm going to keep using it because otherwise it's just like hello everyone on the minimap [Applause] right that orange mark is the last place i saw that so there's a guy on the over the river in a blue uh oh there's a guy here i'm green behind us yeah yeah they're miles away and also to the right and i'm gonna mark him right there on green as well and they all have to come to us because of the zone it's so good have a good time there lucky i'll see you right in front of me everyone's got dmr's broke that guy that's marked in red a little slap and tickle for our distant fellows what about that one on red marks there's another team i think near me over here somewhere there's lots of fighting going up over here behind us [Applause] just above green marker it was maybe closer closer i think yeah maybe there never mind what was that was that an ax 50 i don't know could have been impelling oh here do you mind i'm not a teammate not a team wipe sorry up here [Music] yeah watch green because he could easily shoot us in the head here [Music] that's the guy i downed there'll be more than one in there yeah yeah we're just watching these guys move out of the building could be another one uh west wacky 280 uh white building white building roger dodger he's going to get hit by the zone do you think that's all it's going to have to come out i haven't heard any more footsteps oh he's got a lot on me can you mark where these guys are there's only one is one guy it's one guy one thing red thing right here self-reviving [Applause] anybody got that munitions box no i have a play box we can i can get a munitions box i need plates but up at this fire station we can get a munitions box ammo is uh how you say bad yeah i'm pretty low on ar ammo as well i can drop some jack okay thanks a little bit uh no there might still be someone behind us a bit dubious about it on that roof there purple let's go get self-righteous i can make a move if you want to try and shoot again there is started you got a jack you got that um sorry yeah um from ahead of you what the hell oh otherwise i'm self pressing i'm gonna run double down double down nice last challenge someone else snipes you then lachlan oh it's all banner it's fine right but someone else is just saying that yeah [Music] oh the bounce on [Applause] [Applause] there's a red flare there we didn't respawn maybe maybe no no it wasn't yeah you're right where's the guy who ghosted them so they're going to be up the top of the hill they'll be up top of the hill this is behind us i thought yeah there's two guys just dropped in over there on that red mark two of them just dropped fascinating uh anybody got any kill streaks or anything that'd be used they're on the buy station on that red mark in the middle of the lake no one on the right by the looks of it i see them i'm being spectated become a hacker could you show them on the air one's got a riot shield it's actually the guy people killed as well quiet shield on the lake on the lake and that's how you deal with riot shielders there another one where's the one they might have been the third another guy must be all right time to go ham in the kitchen check in top of hill check their then we can just see if there's another guy yeah drop down drop it off it might be worth buying another uav because hardly anybody's ghosted you want my cash [Applause] [Music] uh i don't think i've got it i have no idea i can't even remember pretty confident i don't aimed 102 101 oh kill one there you go that was the guy they're still on top of that do we need we want a better position foreign [Applause] here on airfield i think yeah i killed one guy that was near there never mind guys another one on behind the rocks behind the rocks we can push that we can push yeah we should keep them out they've got dmrs i think pushed towards blue mark from the right bounds down with the sticky stand again down again on the one on your right [Applause] [Applause] on the [Applause] behind us they could flank [Applause] we've got a nice position with this wall by the way yeah
