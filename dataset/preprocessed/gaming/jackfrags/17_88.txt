there's a reason that the cycle has been increasing in popularity in terms of player count and people watching the game on video platforms and the reason for that is that it's developing into an utterly fantastic game and is very different from when it initially released now i won't bore you with the gritty details but think of this as escape from talk of light a more casual version of that game but still pretty hardcore you have a hub and a base at the base you receive missions from different vendors you level up your equipment you select your gear go into a map attempting to gather resources battling players and aliens along the way all with the hope of extracting with some goodies the catch of course is that the game has permadeath so you'll lose everything that you had if you die except for what's in your safe pockets however you do have the option to insure some stuff at a cost before you go in so i've been playing it recently again with some friends and enjoyed every minute of it there are some very intense firefights because your life and gear is at stake the only negatives right now for me personally are the third person animations and the audio but there's some real gold here with interesting quests puzzles mining and navigating the levels and so i hope you guys enjoyed this this is some exploration fighting and funny moments leave a like and a comment below
