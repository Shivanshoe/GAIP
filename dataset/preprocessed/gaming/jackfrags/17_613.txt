hi everyone and welcome to some bf4 live gameplay commentary today we're on the wonderful zavod and i'm using the a91 because if you remember the last year for video i did i picked this about someone and i was like this gun sick as you can see i mean the damage is pretty ridiculous on it well i've got a suppressor on it i'll show you in a second after i reload this small there we go suppressor stubby grip that's how she looks nice little black shark camo on there as well so zabon it's just one of those perfect battlefield maps isn't it there's always one of my favorites in bf4 and considering it's one of the vanilla maps i think they did a bang-up job with it but this server is nearly full it's been going for a while we are losing but hopefully there'll be a bit of a comeback here i think they're up on the roof there aren't there trying to go for the snipes i'm gonna follow this guy looks like they know what they're doing i want to get up on that roof and kill that spawn beacon over there oh he just jumps off well that's unfortunate as i went oh that guy went down i wonder if you can get an angle from here oh they've all been killed that's okay shall we go over to f look at this sniper here what gun is that what's the m98b how is it even look how he's shooting that that looks so weird when you look at it like that m98b is such a long rifle though it's peculiar when you see it being fired like that gotta keep my head down here for a second yeah i'm not entirely sure about the recall on this hello i wasn't sure if that guy had a an out there like if there was a hole in the wall there or something luckily there wasn't it's a gorgeous looking map isn't it the game is timeless i mean one day it won't look as good of course but in the meanwhile in 2020 still pretty good i'm almost out of ammo i just realized and the chances of getting oh hello ammo can you draw ammo i was about to say the chances of dropping some ammo yes legend they actually went and did it now we're back right can we take the radar tower usually people up there isn't there we've got a dead guy over here mate come on fire and go grenade launcher at me what was that xm25 maybe right well as we were over this side of the map the other team ruined us and they've captured everything time to take back that which was once ours a lot of ollies isn't there the detail on this map very good anyways we've been surrounded here aren't we he must have been low and him oh you just ran into my crosshair the damage on the server seems really high i don't know if this is like a custom server or something but i don't remember people dying this quick in bf4 maybe they've increased the damage or something unless everyone i'm killing or most people that i'm killing are on low hp that doesn't seem right it says i've got 100 hp oh this is really open ow i had to take cover again there i'll put a nade there maybe right in front of me as well oh there's someone behind me on the radar look [Applause] i just killed that teammate there on the flag where'd you go [Applause] are you in there it might be in here yeah there we are what gun did you have a hostile machine gunner i'm gonna pick that up because i had barely any ammo again it's got a nice sight on it got it in full auto mode let's see if we can push c get that back oh nice little head shot oh he's got the med kit on four i usually have the med kit on three and the defense on four so this is going to be a little bit confusing guy here somewhere where'd you go kill streak challenge what does that mean does someone win a prize if they a vip if they kill me they get a vip could still be on that corner is that someone running across or is that just a friendly i'm sure there's someone there can i just fire the bullet thinks i'm on the radar i need to actually try and get on the point though i'm really playing the objective here am i just yeah it's not a bad killstreak though 19 kills all right let's get capping [Music] oh there's a claymore there and get rid of that for the lads i think we're being surrounded here yep they're pushing push out maybe i could see if i could push out [Applause] little dead yeah it looks like it we do have majority flag right now get back to a and b just feels like coming home playing this game so good like riding a bike oh there we go oh someone else shooting at me ah it's over it is over costila cart 465 won a vip what does that mean what's a vip slot on this server does that get uq access or something right there back on the air 91. i missed a load of easy shots there i feel like i should get out of here now oh that's the grenade launcher isn't it usually when you pick this up just get one kill and die yep it's useless laz watch your back what did i say why do i always do it every time is there a way to check his profile fake sorry i'm gonna do my uh i'm gonna do my thing let's see if they take the bait we'll get to the roof uh i cheat there you go see what they say about that all right get him out here please don't kick me i'm recording the video that guy just instantly believed he was like right okay yeah he said he's a fake that means he must be a fake wow no mercy for rip-ops oh dear i buy a cow on where should we say gumtree do you guys know what gumtree is ow dude i'm trying to talk are you just shooting me in the back someone parachuted off here didn't they being all sneaky beaky right at the top that guy was not expecting me oh come on from the batman more enemies on the point i think i've run the other side dead they're right here oh i hate this come on come back i think he was killed i'm stuck i want to get outside again no sun in that corner it's a really overwhelming point to fight over this is what happened ah damn it let's get on e count this point back where'd you come from oh they are all around us now watch your back oh come on maybe the damage isn't changed after all i'm just bad well we're gonna lose this one but that might that was fun good game how did we do 32 5 6. good game nearly got kicked as well they got kicked and banned for buying my own account on gumtree well i hope you enjoyed that guys always good fun
