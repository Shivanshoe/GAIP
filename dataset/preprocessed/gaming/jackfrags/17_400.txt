now this is the tracking door and it's supposed to be used for vehicles if you fire a vehicle and then you and other members of your team can lock onto it but there is another function of it if you stick it to people like that you can then get your rocket lock on arc rock it down shoot him in the face with it never never gets old welcome guys to bad company too i thought i'd play this today because just recently this game turned 10 years old 10 years old this game is and i downloaded it on steam on my old steam account in fact and there was still like 300 people playing it on pc so i thought you know what let's uh let's have a game erica horror see how it goes so i wanted to do some recon first i've got my pokeballs here and the classic m24 how did you not see me well how did i not see you hello m93 chunks this thing here is a drone or something i don't remember how you use it though how'd you do that of course i've got a c4 too ready to make some big booms and these things you throw them out and it just shows you where people are on the mini map put a little theresa on the minimap that kind of thing but this map is really good on rush but it's also on conquest i couldn't find any live servers on rush so just throwing up conquest let's do it pretty good it's a much smaller section of the map though on the brush variant it does go all the way down to the harbour that was a miss that's better but it's a really uh intense map on conquest i think this server has disabled the tanks as well i'm pretty sure we can get tanks on this we should be able to maybe that's just on rush how good is that sound though with that sniper rifle so good it's very strange playing this game because when you spring you can't strafe at the same time it's difficult to explain it works a lot better on consoles on pc the movement is just it's so weird by today's standards that red very skin though that's so iconic to me like that just screams bad company too there's another one up there with a rocket launcher where are they who's the guy on the bus couldn't afford a ticket i'm shot in the back yes red very guy again nice little position this is the enemy bush hooky down there [Applause] they kind of look like ewoks i don't know why we called them bush bookies and we should have just oh my god they're no scope i know they're gonna get luckier than that we should just call them ewok shouldn't we there's one i think i made me too low there i don't know look at these animations oh nice i mean the bipod is uh jiggling around a little bit but i think the animations have definitely stood the test of time oh god that's the wrong button it's the wrong way around in this game where'd you go oh that one was close you can't like see your health either it's just bloody scream here's the friendly bush wookie here i found got that vss looks so weird now it's kind of cute though right it's like a little teddy bear or something adorable i followed him over here lovely bit laid there let's get more pokeballs down here i've capped all our flags we need to push all the team are just chilling on the spawn i will take this point i'll do what i must get on the point lads look at them they're just chilling back there come on get down here there's a guy right next to me here other side of this truck tracheal dice please come on let's try again see if i can inspire people to push [Applause] well to be fair who was that tripping nated me though i gotta get out you know what i find quite funny about this game i think it still looks good and this came out in 2010 and it's on old frostbite tech the next year october the next year they released battlefield 3 and you put that side by side with this and bf3 looks like a next-gen game i think even today though like if you play bf3 and 4k ultra graphics on pc it still looks really good it looks better than some modern games and you try and think like what what the developers must have been thinking obviously bad company too fantastic game brilliant destruction but the devs must have been releasing it in march 2010 knowing full well they've got this sick looking next-gen game coming out the next year with flashy graphics and destruction and uh i just think that's quite a funny position to be in i'm gonna switch to assault that part gives you more grenades that one gives you more damage that one something to do with vehicles right let's test it out oh thank you that was useful dude was right there when i spawned that's a grenade launcher this one here is the xma this is one of the quintessential guns but i think i've been bad company too look at that destruction though man i'm getting those grenades and making holes in walls look at this ridiculous scope oh yeah it feels good man the sound as well [Applause] really good fun to play this the sound in this game generally speaking is great how much health have you got dude there's someone there who is oh the top fire man there's quite a lot of recoil on these guns you know close down yeah i can drop ammo when i'm playing this it's quite different sir wasn't even aiming at you trying to get that recon oh my god i think he's dead ewok he's dead it's fine the class setup is a bit different to how they did it [Music] i'm sure they use that same voice actor for bf3 i recognize the voices oh we've managed to flip the map around now we've got all three points now let's see someone then yes i did i got the engineer class now i thought i should just play all the classes in this video it'd be quite fun engineer gets the rockets like that [Music] oh my god posted wookiee on the menu tonight this scar as well it's quite cool boom yes direct i hit feel cheeky when i hit in between the rockets but so much fun they're here hey what's up i should pull back maybe getting a bit too pushy there this is the medic got my defibs is that no revive animations here you do get these nice lmgs with the medic class which seems a bit weird today but they're absolute beamers cool reload animation that how do you want working you want some health figure take my health i have to revive this ewok here oh my god enemy you are fight i'm going you revive one kill another now one other thing that the recon had that i haven't showed you yet is this motor strike it's on a cooldown but you just stand still point at something hold your mouse down and then look at that water strike comes in and of course that played really nicely with the destruction in the game but you could drop it on mcoms when the game came out and just destroy the m-com you could just blow it up people would just chill at the back with tanks as well what the hell oh you're not dead [Applause] come on there we go we won nice gg that was really fun
