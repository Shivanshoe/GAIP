modern warfare 2 one of the best call of duty games ever made from a shocking campaign to addictive multiplayer this game had it all and if there's one image that comes to mind when i think of this game that doesn't make me sad it's the m4 from the training mission right at the start of the campaign and how dominant it was in the multiplayer it's just so nostalgic for me and as luck would have it when it was in the store i picked up the task force m4 blueprint for warzone here it is in all its glory almost exactly the same and i thought wouldn't it be fun to play a solo match using this and see how it goes now to remain faithful to modern warfare 2 the only thing that i'm changing is the magazine going from 30 to 60 and that's it everything else will stay the same which means mid-range barrel stock iron sights and no suppressor which could be a bad move in warzone but i'm doing it anyway i'll have to try and get close to targets and surprise them i'll also be playing as classic ghost 2 because i just had to for this video he's so cool as always a massive thanks to these guys using my code in the cod store jack frags in all caps if you do buy something use my code tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one with that said like the video if you enjoy it thank you and let's get into the action well i am playing as ghost but i'm not gonna attempt to do a ghost impression because that would just be embarrassing [Applause] we've got that roof there and someone in here well that was a bit more difficult than i wanted it to be it's not pig that roof at all that poor guy was getting beamed i pick it now ah i think there's a zip line over here isn't there heartbeat sensor though thank you i'll take that there's two there now losing ground you can't be on the roof here's the one super mario running over yeah he's still up there hmm what do i do here just falling back and got my loadout because that roof is a bit dodgy and here we go here's that awesome looking modern warfare 2 m4 get that stopping power and straight away quite a few people around me it's still here in the corner look as long as there's not a claymore here or something i should be all right [Applause] be advised uav is bingo fuel i found something don't really seem to be paying much attention [Applause] should be right oh they're inside yeah [Music] [Laughter] that kid was surprised as hell there's one over there too but i don't see him you know a bit of a segue here but while i've got your attention wargaming i'm doing a bit of a sponsorship with them so thanks to them for partnering up for me they are running a play test for a new first-person shooter game that they're making and uh basically they're looking for people to play it and give some feedback on it and uh i can't really say much about it apart from that it's a squad based shooter and there's some play tests that are running from the 11th to the 14th of march on european servers and i'm going to be playing there too giving it a shot give me some feedback on it and there'll also be a survey after you've played the game so you can give your opinion on it so if you're interested in doing that there's a link down in the description below and uh be honest with them let them know what you like what you didn't and if you complete the survey you'll get a 10 euro gift card so a bit of incentive there for you anyways right back to the game what is that gun that's so loud a little tip that i wanted to share with you guys if you want a parachute and get hang on a second enemy vehicle that's a mess never mind if you want to parachute and go further just hold sideways like you see i can actually get across to this building here and also get shot on the side but yeah if you just hold sideways you go like way further than if you're holding forward no i wouldn't have been able to make that jump there if i did the normal way let's get another hello [Applause] oh i wanted to finish they never let me do it anymore i'm gonna buy a self-res and another uav friendly recons online this one right here uav entering the ao colby that looks good yes semtex is just too good although some people are taking them right now instead because you get the finish if you down them there was one more dude here in the uav advised uav rtv for reason well they are very in the gas right now [Applause] missed yeah dude was on like one hp and it was a ghost skin i feel bad now no buys around so i'm just gonna get the bounty let's get it done well that guy's way out there position the by the way here so i'm just going to get another yo [Applause] uav entering the ao enemy uav overhead there's one on the bridge as well should be able to see him where'd they go i'm moving why can't i see this guy there's the one on the bridge there we go never mind target right here no bunny rabbit i need close air support on this target i think i could have just got your mind oh i missed [Music] the second that's weird okay fair enough let's get another bounty and they're just chilling in that big building there there's a quality behind me you want to go let's go chicken backwards oh god look at the name as well big big mama 69 that's the quality name though it's 10 out of 10 nigerian one more guy here at the bunker i think they're good yeah i'm not going down there i could just get the truck down there for a laugh oh you see that little sniper boy in there a challenge not a headshot any closer this is tracker three one good job it's probably not gonna get a kill but i just don't like that guy being in the [Music] i mean i could die here but it's gonna be quite a difficult shot for him i'm gonna hit it square kill me i'm just gonna stand this let's see four i think i almost died then i think i think that guy almost killed me the truck's nearly dead now look down at least we're live someone's [Applause] [Applause] where are you is that a body yeah it's almost dead there did i see movement then hostile yeah i did sorry two hits went down three hits went down dude was an absolute tank no one in that brown building i'm going to take this six people left dice thank you just feel safer now stay here just out of the zone though but i'm gonna go for that truck it's so strong in solos especially end game not controlling i can find someone in the barn are you kidding me [Applause] how am i alive i don't think they're pushing either i'm keeping my head down right now why didn't they just shoot me they should have just shot me they went for the rocket it's fine i think it's fine i've got some cover here they were in this barn just there when you [ __ ] face them by opening the door [Applause] you're gonna pee i want revenge though now that was my truck man that was my play that's probably the luckiest thing that's happened to me could have easily just shot me oh this sucks no one's died either they could be behind the car there gas is closing get to the new safe zone where are you you can't oh there we go i've just got a right shield no i don't no it's not worth wasting my airstrike on it is it this dude knows what he's doing as well man hey right shields and solos are so annoying i don't have a stun either just got the heartbeat where from four people left is that sunset [Applause] there we go impact no joy i think yeah the shield guy's still alive because i didn't get an assist or anything right here [Applause] oh that's so annoying we both got to move though does he even have a gun he's coming he's coming yes beating the mini boss give him the shield give me the shield give me the shield thank you 1v1 might be the guy that i downed not on the right i've got a push here we go yes oh man that was amazing well done the right shield saved me in the end the riot shield saved me i became that which i'm that which i meant to destroy oh that was amazing man my heart is pounding right now [Applause] absolutely pounding [Applause] there you go that is the uh modern warfare 2 m4 that's a lot of fun that gun not the best build for war zone because uh you don't really have that much range but pretty good up close unfortunately you're gonna be on the mini map when you're firing but uh i mean it's so nostalgic but i hope you enjoyed watching that guys if you did leave a like thank you if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next
