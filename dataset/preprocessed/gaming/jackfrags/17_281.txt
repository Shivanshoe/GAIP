battlefield 20 42 news is heating up and yesterday we got a new little teaser video and some information about the game so i thought that i'd jump on bf4 today and play some gunmaster to celebrate the fact and basically what it was there was a little video posted on twitter i'll play it now if you haven't seen it because you can see what it is [Music] essentially on august the 12th there's going to be a 9 minute cinematic video about bf2042 that was my kill dude and it's going to cover the story of the game and apparently it will set up the war that's going on in 2042 a bit law but a story nine minutes long and it looks like it's proper cgi high budget stuff it's gonna be really interesting to see what they do there because yeah there's no single player in the game all the narrative is going to be in the multiplayer and the live service that guy just ruined me there without doubt 12. we didn't really get much from the video but you see some cool looking ospreys flying into a storm there's the big ship which is probably the uss raven rock which has been mentioned before when they've done teasing for the game must be an important part of the story that there's a guy right here took a while now the most interesting part of it for me is when that soldier runs through the streets and they're holding a modern looking weapon you can't see their face but it looks like they've got a hood on and it also there's a guy just hiding behind that bush well that was easier than i expected it to be it also looks like they're wearing a ballistic mask on their head and that particular mask looks incredibly similar to the chinese support from bf4 again i'll put a picture up on the screen here so you can see and have a little comparison oh my god dude just wreck me with that m60 yeah so it could be the the f4 and bf 2042 operate in the same universe maybe the story of bf3 bf4 is connected to bf2042 and this is almost a sequel to those games and that's a really interesting proposition for me because geez because imagine if bf4 stuff turned up in bf2042 imagine if we get remade bf4 maps and weapons gadgets whatever it might be in bf portal because we've got bf3 bc2 and 1942 so why not bf4 why not do a remake of everyone's favorite meat grinder operation locker you get what i'm saying it could be fun are you creeping up on me dude yeah there's so many iconic maps in bf4 really tons to choose from if they ever wanted to go down that route now alongside this little video teaser they've launched a new website it's got a bit of an interactive map on it with a few things that you can click on oh my god must have been really low hp what's this 338 maybe i think so and on that map there's notes from a journalist that's living in this uh 2042 world and explaining their story and every day leading up to the 12th when they show the cinematic they're going to release updates for that m60 again man keep getting killed by that there's a couple of new screenshots as well that they tweeted oh god i hate this gun so much sucks yeah the screenshots are pretty nice i mean difficult to tell really if they're in game or their concept art because the parts of it look like it's in game parts of it look like a screenshot so i don't know oh my god oh there's a guy right on me i'm being chased it's a bulldog isn't it yeah i think the uh i think their concept are but they've just been drawn to look like they're in game but they look sick okay i'm getting out there someone chasing me here yeah i have a feeling that every day they do an update for this uh fictional journalist they might release a couple of world screenshots or concept art but i don't know what do you guys think do you think that's a screenshot or concept i think based on that sandstorm in the background it's it's concept art pretty neat either way though because it did end up looking like that in the trailer who puts a scope on a unica six [Music] i can't quite get the angle here now there's someone rushing me you know i'm going i need to just get lucky with this or just spam it that works i'll just get up close you know one more kill with this thing who killed you oh deagle that's more like it yes someone coming up maybe not is it friendly no not like this the railgun dice please have to charge it up was that not a hit come on it's more like it gotta lead a tiny little bit oh sorry sneeze so i'll leave that in the video i'm sure we've had a sneeze before not the bow it's almost as bad whoever made this uh rotation for gun masters an absolute troll because right at the end i mean people are just going to be catching up with you aren't they when you've got guns like this and the combat bow in bf4 is one of the worst combat bows in video games oh my god how do i miss that there we go let me shot in the back free kill for you there mate enjoy that yeah so uh the bf 2042 stuff onto the knife it's really exciting you know it's august guys beta next month that flyby look at the way the character runs in this game ow that's mean i'm trying to get my knife kill i want this guy here no stop it oh my look what i've been killed by yeah it kind of runs around like a toddler or something no that's bad that's an explosion oh this is so frustrating trying to get this knife girl this guy are they wearing a headset oh my dude i could have won this is their spawn over here unless it's flipped i think it's flipped cool i just want one knife kill that's all we need there's no friendlies here so there's got to be enemies one there let's do it here i'll make you mine yes we got it
