hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome through some Call of Duty wars oh no no it's not been a live gameplay stream in a while but I've just been so busy with video work that I haven't really had a chance but things have eased off a bit for me and so live streams will be returning and regularly which is kind of Awesome so if you're watching this life thank you and see you guys in the chat which yet you guys being here and if you're watching it as a vaad welcome and hopefully we have some good game so today what I wanted to do was try and play some solo matches and I've built a m30 loadout that I think is really competitive now a lot of people sleep on the end 13 because they just go you know what best comes in the game obviously and 4 it's the Grouch the mp7 mp5 and the M 13 although when war zone came out I think it was quite popular for a little while really it's kind of fallen out of fashion a bit but I put this together and something that a lot of people don't know about the M 13 is that it's got a higher headshot multiplier and if you go for headshots with this thing it will drop people it will drop people with an m4 with a growl it's just earthy so this is how I've got it set up I've got the 50-round magazine stead of the 60 because I thought you know if I'm playing solos do what really needs 60 bullets I'm really careful about who I'm engaging and how I'm doing it do I really need 60 I've gone with 50 I think that just gives you a little better mobility and control might be best the first sustained fire recall control that kind of thing the only thing I wasn't sure about was the sight because I don't really like the iron sights on the end 13 I just hate the way they look like they're nowhere near as good as the ground will be m4 for example so I've gone with a little red dot sight now one of my favorite range sights is the VLK this one I was kind of like I'm ignoring like shall I go for down or shall I go for the mini reflex but I decided to go for the mini reflex instead you could also go for like a G I mean reflex like that works quite well too but without said that's the bill that we will be playing with today and hopefully like I said hopefully we can get some wins I'm going to just throw the heartbeat sensor on there and we'll be playing solos for a couple of hours let's do this so I'm gonna have to get a few kills get the contracts get that load out and we'll do a bit of testing I've used this build of eating squads before and it's quite tasty quite tasty indeed but in solos I've not really tried it you see I'm toasting with the blackout rounds recently they're not worth it don't bother with them but this build I think I think it's got some potential boys and girls I think we can do this I'm looking forward to this I've not really played any war zone today so gonna be good fun nice mixer plays in there too lots of ps4 players put an Xbox guys there too hello John one how you doing so just that subscriber McCoy too freaky you missed the streams hello David cars ride me into Valhalla what's up guys thank you for coming along I really appreciate you guys being here just realize as well my field of view is low because I use a low field of view for the thumbnails it's a low field of view looks a little better yeah I sounded proper copy Ben digital hey I've also got a video coming out soon with this as well the Odin you guys waiting for that one that is an absolute killer this gun is dangerous though I wouldn't build it like this we've already had a new member Connor thank you so much Connor Malik appreciate that I'll have set up some new membership fees we've got operators which are ghosts and phantoms there's different brackets I know a lot of people ask about there's a few emotes as well I'm working on some new remotes and a couple of membership perks as well you know as I'm going to be your live streaming there regularly I thought that I should get all that in order Moe price Thank You Vince and an try with the Scout perfect it slows thank you to the five I love them I'm 13 but I won the mp7 because of the low interesting Battle Royale avoid the gas ice to do this so I'm pipe I'm absolutely I we can do this where should we drop her I mean super story's always a bit mad isn't it like that that could be a good first drop although bit risky isn't it you don't a die straight on your first game dear let's go there we can do this at James Bagwell thank you for becoming a ghost we operate and could apply Ethan thank you for becoming a member and Samwell should appreciate it thank you so much I do anyone actually land here don't think so nice bit like there of that no one's talked about contract either change any Olympian I missed it and usually people go for these like right away they're so easy can't believe no one London agree new Xena quiet yeah I changed my sensitivity as well I lowered it a bit I heard someone there and you know I was noisy except there in that fire station I actually picked a really good drop here Luke Luke of course me I didn't know there was gonna be no one here is it up in the tower Inez watch me get killed by lava it's ladder is dangerous boys it's absolutely dangerous I think I've been killed by this ladder about like 4 times comin this P we just don't use the ladder we don't do and we'll be okay yeah someone's been here that girl isn't usually oh and is that would be somewhere around here not storage down no no no no no not like this I really don't like storage down sorry Angela this crazy we nearly gone off the load out yeah someone's been through here hmm where's the newest buy station vendor Mart okay else my shilling here try and go for a kill holy cow oh come on you can't jump over that you serious yeah I don't like this Oh like that though and gets the by let's say for the first game where was it yeah this area as well guys so risky man so risky cuz this building here people love to camp in those buildings I bet there's someone there now you know it does windows there have been killed by those windows so how many times all right like just try and get this guy if he's just camping on the roof I'm gonna be really upset blood is right there Oh be careful here boys gotta be careful playing this cautiously Oh in there this is where the guy landed but I think he just heated himself off the building or something I don't know could be riding around somewhere I suppose no idea I just need a little more cash though and I can get that loader I'll actually try this em 13 well that's a nice little jump there isn't it he's just gonna be hiding in there isn't it I hundred percent that'll be some cash here bro what come on I need 700 bucks right now what's what's the deal with this ice cream there and strive around low base that I can trust in potential mates get their cash there's a little fight going down this guy all I did already had his load up and there's a buy station right here that I can use I mean I could just get that load up I'm so lucky that I had that UAV what are you doing they're moving out let's go get that load out we'll be okay you know these solo games are so like it's so different to stimulus solos which is just miss finish and I think yeah there's the boy okay I've got a focus on getting head shots really important here a restock on it not sure that I should have restock on this class I don't really need it Dennis this area stinks as well I don't like to come in here but the mission dictates it boys we got a movie sweep and clear blow it my senses just survived put it down to like my old counter-strike sensitivity I just see someone then I may have seen some movement there in that building I don't know baby's cautiously maybe not okay that's so lucky what the hell I got a speed hack there wasn't yeah my original content stivity was really high right there because for a typical cod multiplayer I think you need a higher sense but for warzone you don't really need a higher sense and lower especially on a mouse way better for like consistent aiming and tracking and controlling recall most importantly like it's a really big deal I've got to get used to this it means that I have to become more energetic with my mouse a little bit more effort in with my mouse you know but apart from that I can see it working out and be beneficial my box is bound solid minutes 11 K right there it's this bike anybody camping horrible done if you guys have play solos recently but it's like a horror game that's you know that's what we're dealing with here lead recall in my position whatever it will go from yeah not high enough like two people in storage down as well yes yeah they actually just going nuts look over there by UAV is being off you are TV for resupply vehicle where is that dude going I want to throw c4 you come back [Music] to shoot this guy's still damp in here I don't know I'm not going in there refused I refused to go into storage down I'm just not doing it why did this guy in the truck go red was it the Jeep yeah I want the truck I want the guy in the truck that's why I care about requesting recon that's the boys he doesn't have ghosts so I mean I could I could try and hunt him down here Dannan marked a target be advised a vehicle ingleses RGB for resupply he's just running into the air for the messy real messy [Music] is there gonna be a dead silence in this crate that's morning boys well done I didn't do anything [Music] hmm really want to go in there to be honest with you yeah that guy had ghost cuz he wasn't coming up on the minimap where's this zone gonna end up pays the question everyone wants to know that don't they where's the zone gonna end you guys think that this game has predetermined zones but was it always random I don't know if it's like just coincidence but I feel like I've had the same circle so many times that could literally be kiba cursor I've just played so many rounds of war zone but just by the law of probability you will just get the same circle every now and again you guys remember firestorm a battlefield a battle royal that had like predetermined circles and loot [Music] I'll take down over your head weird biceps and hours under the bridge requesting recon you a pn3 Bao everyone's Coco's I feel like I should have a pair but directory I feel like that might be the play oh joy I'm just trying to win yeah I've been trying I seen your location be advised to Avia's we hope you are keeping for richness what is it you [Music] as a Jeep this guy's just going edge of the map huh this guy's playing the long game [Music] well he was playing the long game and now he's hosted a and I get to keep my Jeep if I can get it out at the out-of-bounds area us I don't think I could do that I think I think I would get killed yes night Arno manually how do you only throw one see for an inch to explode it you double tap f you double tap you're you ski on on PlayStation I think it's square and on Xbox it's um 2x the left but yeah you just double tap and you you don't get an 8 them both but you don't throw another one I should say I feel like I've read this game well so far in terms of where the circles gone or where the players are the going to Jeep wasn't the dude that was hunting me those this is gonna end here right down there find a bad for me because I don't have a sniper you didn't get that second loadout did I I could but then again I off ug so useful late-game Paulo 98 those strong sniper hate doing this it's just the tunnel with no cover like if someone Pete yeah I'd be absolutely screwed you know with the Jeep's as well with these vehicles I kind of wish that if they with all the vehicles in the game if it's not being used it shouldn't have the engine turned on that'd be a really effective way of letting players know if a particular quad bike been used and then I know okay maybe there's someone around here or maybe I'm kind of safe right now that boxing there had been looted looted yeah I'm doing the cockney thing again looted I need to correct my pronunciation be someone in this tunnel coming out not like it your windows closing for closing yeah this is like absolute worst for me like being out here on the airfield and not having a sniper oh okay well I can get my sniper from that phase B or in Jesus he heard me I think and bestowed upon me a loadout drop but will it be the death of me I mean this is it's a bit dubious isn't it boys it's large building here I'm fine on the left and your windows I can get shot from here big fan of that and ghostly boys around I am just going to wait here a sec and see if anyone comes out of this building that's the kind of building that you would camp in solos when there's only 10 people left not seen or heard anything those anyone there come on if you're in there you've got to go I'm just being really cool she's here guys really cautious just in case right now it did hear someone's shooting down here the left no eyes on there fix players left he'll be someone on my right stick to this high ground for a second and move in I saw someone them family who's been shot in the back I'm moving put a picks up two kills then go in the back as well there's another dude behind me I knew there was someone on the right look at that little bridge spot as well that's a nice little spot right there do we see how they do it's got a nice little pink m4 mr. Rhyne Potter oh boy I just got the Hobby censor never mind right I've got a lot of new members and donations to read out here guys I just want to say thank you so much for all the support in that first match we didn't get the win but I see you guys hey this is gonna take me a while this is gonna take me a while oh man we got a load of new members McFeely's austin de maria nemesis i'm a thank

ages ago Rowan and Keely danielwoods Simon ghost Wylie this actual assignment ghost while is it he's watching the stream and kept on and Tom Daley thank you so much guys a really appreciate your support anyways we didn't get that one all kills in the bag on the first game I think me missing a couple of those sniper shots cost me their they've actually got a classic PR in now okay right we might have that's new they've just added that no cash no contracts no load outs no respawns loot he'll survive did I try that rush should I keep doing solos with the center's aim what do you think guys that's just been released I've not tried that you know I feel like I should try this this is going to be completely different thanks again Cameron do you have ghosts on your snake shots I don't use the snake shots hunter I use them for one video just to show how broken they were and they were patched okay so lots of people are saying try it do classic try it I think there's more people saying try classic and solos but it's really difficult to tell because the chart is just going at like 5,000 miles an hour all right so many people are saying try it I've got to do I've got to try it I have to try this guy's but though it looks like no one's actually looking for a match just do it right here we go so we play with Andrew saw and mannequin and they're both on playstation or mannequins gone here we go it's supposed to be trios not quads what's happened there well I've got four people there's only three people in the lobby but there's four people on the left the proper warm-up won't be deployed so this actually have the no it didn't have the rules in game so as far as I know VR classic is no loadouts no by stations no respawns it's just it's like pub gin it's basically pub G but balls on this is tell you what this will play completely completely different watch your six mate white only oh god no Guillermo says I personally think the OTB our mode will be less action-packed will say be Bahama fossick is super fun reminds me of the good old days of jihad Kuwait decisions matter oh man a default weapon pool though so you could get you could get a green m4 you couldn't get a growl you could get the new mp7 the Madaba you could get a couple of ayres 50s you could get HDR if you're lucky [Music] Battle Royale all right soldier marker drop point for your team oh man no contracts this is weird this is just weird let's go there TC stand by for deployment [Music] it's a mode for new sister on to do you think so I don't think this mode to be new friendly I think this mode it'd be more difficult to be honest I give are die that's it I'm done let's go let's go somewhere else in [Music] and you don't even start with a pistol that's crazy right okay right this is crazy guy not building I think of these guys and all of that it's just running around with his it's out oh this is gonna be weird this is going to be really really weird wow it's like no ammo either we just go let's go free oh that's fun don't know if this will be girl bad this is so weird man oh you know what ask you just over there I gotta kill you never know dude still on the roof there get him Joe go Johnny get him where is it what do you want from there you want to you want to go [Music] Joe go Johnny come here on a place a mate so you don't really like contracts is such a big deal aren't they in war zone they really are give you Johnny yoga Johnny's an absolute legend and King Martland - absolute legends just camping on that roof I think I think we should move let's move somewhere I'm squad leader I'm a skirt most all down thermal silence they are you have to play it so cautiously could stay if you're dead you're dead that's it face it let's go let's go void may be a viable strategy is to find a keycard yeah yeah then you could get a guaranteed like epic glue right [Music] any boys now that guys stayed they I'll not ready for the whole time it's not me Lew's Therin when the fact that I've got a gold what is this so you get for cheering my squad minute that's what you get on the roof won't peak it again pick it again I broke his armor anyway up to there is a ladder isn't it any of y'all need this he's like a proper cowboy that guy move I don't want to get involved with that guy to be honest but that's nothing but pain over there boys nothing but pain drop some armored plates with Johnny again I was here get it Johnny get the armor oh no no what we can't buy him back now that's it King Marlins gone he's gone this is how I feel third place termite he is so do you want what you want from me Johnny Johnny we're a man down now I don't I don't know what to say um all I can say is sorry I feel like I've let everyone down we'll pull through Johnny okay we can make this no orange box whatever yeah that's my gun Donny can we get this disregard dad I don't please hey CK oh hey Johnny get it oh you don't want it all right you can be sole motive in this game just by shaking your head brilliant rest in peace King Martland what a great name boo free all right Johnny let's get in there this guy can't hear me by the way I just like to think that he can hear me it's one of those one of those situations he only knows what he's doing though he's a pro gamer look at him slide in he's having a great time Johnny's Johnny's had these a few games of bores oh sure yeah this is so campy this game mode on tracks really they just push everyone together you know they give you a bit of incentive to move around the map but the muddy element of war zone is like such a great improvement for the classic battle royale game like this it like in um like this is war zone without contract this is it it's interesting I think like this would be highly competitive in squads of poor know people really gonna be moving around the map looking for the best loop moving though and then thinking about their positioning I'm not sure that it works that well though like is it interesting you know a show Johnny the wifey wagon Johnny look at this found saliva good right there I just want you I just want to show you it like I just this is thumbs up or is it thumbs down which one you don't like the wifey wagon he's running away from his I assume he doesn't like the wifey wagon but we're not just gonna camp in here Johnny come on six we're not campus not today oh no no no no this is the area that we started in right gonna get over the roof sniper hey okay he's got a scope I've got a car 98 good a nice sight love that he's gonna get red stuff Johnny there's nothing we can do I'm sorry no don't go that way don't go that way I didn't mean it Johnny no no I didn't mean it all right Johnny let's go always having to crack from fit 300 meters away Johnny here in to me is isn't known for come on you're better than that white light joy Oh Johnny okay now is the chance now now we do it Johnny Lima let's go light him up now we know now we know we got out early Johnny it's some let's chill over here for a second yeah that's the helicopter I hear someone then no perks as well so Papi's sense is Opie I probably got one of the most Opie loadouts at the moment oh he's a cool guy man he doesn't he doesn't afraid of anything okay he's killed a few aliens in his spare time it's that kind of guy no junk yeah hey there what do we get Charlie what do we get I don't want any of that me campus delight I hate downside there's so many Oh so many areas of this month those eight only this is drawn a night mark some gear Johnny's a homie yeah is cho gath it inbound we're gonna go Johnny yeah move on in this way right long journey home this is we've gotta cross the LA River deadly Johnny's in the chat there's no way Johnny's in the chat that's not the real Johnny maybe it is Johnny's a big gamer Friday evening he's had a tough week at work he's kicking back he's playing some war zone he's having a great time we all need to be more like Johnny but I shouldn't have fired so many bullets at that helicopter should I Iraq it would be nice if the gas moved faster yeah maybe wish everyone a bit closer together maybe it does I know I don't feel like it does it feels quite slow-paced this Donnie's a Chad well okay I kind of wanted this classic BR solos you know I'd like that as well like to try that out cuz OG solos it's a song it's actually one of my favorite things to do in that game see you like that slide Johnny like that good in it just slide there no he doesn't like it putting words in his mouth now I'm sorry Johnny I didn't mean to I'm glad that I'm leaving that place behind Johnny that's where we started we lost King Martland there I made a burial for him but now we're leaving there were times in life that you just have to let the balloon go and move on just move on dead to me don't feel anything nothing nothing no no feels oh you got a hostile Johnny no he's got eagle eyes as well look at this eagle eyes you come and display that okay disengage don't we need to watch our backs there mate can't get stuck in a fire [Music] let's go joy you know let's go let's take the fight to them I'm sick

before we wrap up I will show you the build again just if you want to know that's it you've got to go for headshots if you want to compete with the m4 in the Grau you have to go ahead shots with this loadout it's pretty good and sometimes you will beat an m4 and a growl but if you go for headshots you will always beat them in a one-on-one fight if you both the same HP this is the headshot
