i thought that i'd start this video off flying through the air i don't know why but it's fitting i've gotten two guys balti and they just drove into the tornado and that's the end of the balti but there it is today using the ntw 50 i've not really done a video on this gun it's cool though what is going on there it can be a one shot sniper rifle and also talk about the potential 2042 news that we might get soon hello fake and the reason for that is that on the 1st of february we're going to get the ea investor call and in the past typically in the past they released some news or updates like on the day or the day before i think i can hear someone underneath me yeah i'm gonna try something there hello yes it worked right i'm going back so i think that um on the first of feb whether that's you know by dice or during the ea investors call there'll be some kind of update about the game because we've still not had any communication really about road map and what's going on with things but this is not a bad start here that big old door's coming down there isn't it stance ntw 50 who uses that bad weather incoming mckay it's a tornado it's a bit worse than bad weather mate i'm going to talk about the potential of the game going free to play as well was that a ricochet angel stop it angel another angel damaged vehicles with it so look i think i've just got the standard rounds in here as well can you go away oh my god apparently vehicle players are getting really annoyed by these things what are you doing because the old c5 don't supposed to be really op if you do that look damage tanks with it as well body's freaking out oh god this guy on the ropes here and they're out stupid body come on boys yes oh sniper i'll do a little trick here at the rock well that didn't work i'm gonna get him you were like here somewhere were you there's nobody here oh what are you doing in the bush just randomly in a bush fair enough wildcat don't like that yeah i think it just makes sense you know like ea investor schools are such a big deal for the investors and also you know i think there's a lot of people in the bf community who are just looking for an answer or like some form of communication as to what's going to happen with battlefield and with this game so first of february could be a really big deal why am i just getting hit markers all the time another hit marker some of these big kills or am i just like am i out of range or something is it bugged you that doesn't seem right that that should have been a kill that was definitely like a head or a chest shot right can you just i can't even see him now because that smoke god that's annoying i need ammo as well no one else on here no no over there you you're the problem trade kill i hate that i'm gonna go get revenge casper excuse me casper please casper boris okay can i nail this shot here 200. boom nice how's that bloody drone watch see that 1000xp you do that once per day are you still there let's see him i've got the heebie-jeebies i think someone's name was it you no i wasn't you i'm gonna go up here and this is gonna be spectacular oh okay that's not i didn't know how i planned another hit marker am i doing this wrong guys have i have i misunderstood the ntw 50 i'm gonna get that tank some ammo here boom i think he knows where i'm at oh they got out okay you know what mate i'm gonna steal your tank still usable look it'll just regen watch a bit slow to start but we'll get there just going to pretend that no one's here i mean one rocket and i'm dead luckily i've got smoke there's a guy here somewhere hello oh that feels good you know i've never noticed the lights on the front before are they usually on can i get this chopper how about with the gun no no yes there it is you just gotta wait for that perfect moment and now i've got a tree this is a dangerous point but i like it yeah i thought as well like a lot of people um wow a lot of people were asking me if i think 2042 will go free to play so i know there's been a few rumors in the community about that i don't think it will it's a cheeky wildcat here and um the reason for that is that uh if you remember what happened with firestorm should have been free to play wasn't and then there were a load of rumors that there were legal problems with making it free to play because it was sold as part of the game so why wouldn't that apply with 2042 faulty get off me what are you doing leave me alone there we go so thinking about this logically with reason and with the legal implications look what they sold in the gold and ultimate editions to people i don't remember exactly what it was but it was like year one pass four specialists battle passes some skins and there was a couple of other things in there too like an art book and uh digital soundtrack so they've sold that to people so they have to deliver that they're not just gonna turn around and go oh the whole game's free now i don't think that makes sense at all i'm gonna roll kill this guy [Laughter] yeah so i reckon there's at least a year before anything goes free if at all portal doesn't really make sense in my opinion because if you give portal away for free unless you limit it then that's just like giving the whole game for free isn't it because portal's got all the 2042 stuff in hazard zone i don't think that makes sense because even if that was free i don't think many people would play it unless it got like a massive overhaul and a new map or something and the base game because like i said what they sold in the golden ultimate editions i just don't see it happening so i think whatever we get the investors call it's gonna be really interesting i might live stream actually or i might just do a quick round-up video uh if there's a statement there or something before earlier in the day we'll have to see i'm gonna kill these guys faulty oh you put a cheeky c5 on it there murray oh oh my god okay i'm on the map angel come back angel did you see me hey you may have seen me one more kill yes we got it and then we were killed anyways i think that's about gonna do it guys round's about to end here didn't win
