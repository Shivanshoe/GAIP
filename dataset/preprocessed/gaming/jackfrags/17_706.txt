this weekend I've been trying so hard to win a solo game of course war zone I don't know how many of you guys are actually playing solo Cod war zone but if you don't know what it's like at the moment it's quite difficult because of course if you're playing solo you're probably someone who's really competitive and you just want to win that's it it's about you your skill your movement and can you beat every other player that you encounter in the game and there's no one else to blame it's just you you have to make your own decisions and commit to them you have to make sure that you consistently aim do you go for contracts do you camp in a building for most of the game what do you want to do well I've been practicing a lot and I think that I've found a loadout a setup in a style of play that really suits me well and keeps me engaged in solo matches and I wanted to share this match with you today and also the loadout that I was using so first things first solo matches in cod warzone quite different to squats in squads typically the fire fights are at longer ranges and they're a bit more chaotic let's say but in solo depending on your play style your loadout choices will differ drastically for me my preferred play style is to be active I like to hunt people down take bounties go for missions I'm not one of these players that wants to win by hiding in a building waiting for the zone staying on the edge and then moving into another building I just get really bored playing like that and I'm not saying that isn't a legitimate tactic if you want to win it's just that it's not for me I can't play like that I don't find it engaging at all so I'm always on the move so I have to be out and about I have to be hunting people and engaging otherwise I just get bored and I turn off now with that said I think my absolute favorite weapon for solos and arguably sometimes four squads depending on who you're playing with is the mp7 and this is how I've got mine set out I've got the monolithic suppressor on the muzzle the FSS recon barrel TAC laser commando for grip and 60 round Mac in terms of secondary RPG I just think you need it for infantry and vehicle kills perks VOD ghost and amped you absolutely need ghost in solos just to stay off the mini-map and of course c4 and heartbeat sensor heartbeat sensor I think at the moment is necessary in solos because it's one of the only things that can actually stop you being killed by people just hiding in buildings and you need to know when people are hiding in buildings because ultimately you're going to have to lose because of the zone and to get loot and also because you'll have to go to buy stations if you really want to win one of the reasons that I love the mp7 for solos is that I try to get close to people and also this look at the recoil so if you just shoot at a wall the recoil always goes up and to the right there's a bit of deviation there but it's quite predictable and roughly always the same so if you think about how you would counter that in a game all you have to do is pull down and to the left like this and if you get good at this you can end up with a much tighter spread compared to what the actual recall is like you can see there's a massive difference there and once you get used to that in practice you can destroy people with the mp7 from medium and even longer ranges you've just got to make sure that your tracking is consistent and you're countering that recoil as much as possible and of course at close range hipfire is really good and the rate of fire will just destroy almost every other assault rifle in the game so with that said I wanted to show you guys a match here I'm not going to tell you if I win or lose but I can say that we did end up with a high kill count and it's quite action-packed and we're gonna talk through the beats of the game how I'm using that loadout when I get it and just going through some of the thought process about what I did and why maybe you'll find it interesting and you could try some do stuff yourself or maybe you'll just be able to tell who knows with that said the first kill there was quite straightforward and after that I did get shot in the back by this guy and I just had a feeling the fact that they opened up so early that I could push this they would just look in the wrong way got the dropping them nice and easy another guy came over by the fence they obviously saw on the mini-map and heard what was going on take a bit of cover with the reload and then I'm feeling safe that's three people in a small area there's probably not someone else foot I assumed incorrectly one will go at the wall here and I went to rush with the few the shots there and that guy took me out remember the name is well Lucia Camino that's important so I'm in the gulag straight away three kills and we're in pretty early at the start of the game it's not looking good now in the gulag I like to push up and assert control of the map as quickly as possible because then you can just walk take it easy listen out and try and figure out with your stuns are you smoked so you're neighs roughly where the opponent is and as soon as that flag is enabled I try and go for it because it just puts pressure on the other person and they ran in there's a bit of confusion with the smoke I got the kill so we're back in the game we redeploy now in solos cash is really important you've got to get cash as quickly as possible so you can get UAVs self revives armor place and spam them so I landed on a recon just to get a bit of money went over and got that and I moved towards the buy station here there was a car nearby just driving around so I had the semtex just in case and at this moment I still haven't got my loadout so I'm just trying to accrue as much cash as possible turned out there was another guy in the parking lot at the top probably going for the UAB to did a bit of damage with the p90 and got the finish with the RPG if you do that kind of damage and your opponent just goes behind cover and you've got that RPG that's the perfect moment to use it because it doesn't give them time to reapply on the plates and also you can just quickly pop out take a shot pop back in and you'll need to take them out or you'll know that they've moved if you don't get a hit marker so that fight they've got me enough to buy the loadout so we've dropped that pick up the class and I've popped the UAV straight away one thing you can do as well is actually mark on the map where people are or have been but I wanted to get this bounty here just keep making money it's really important on solos as I've said and it also gives you situational awareness of where people are so my bounties in here I'm just double-checking with the heartbeat sensor it looks like they've actually got ghosts on and this is one of the sketchiest moments in the game as I'm climbing up the ladder that guy runs into the room and I'm guessing that they only saw my legs but they carried on freaking I've got the height advantage and I know that I can drop finish the job pretty confidently and introduce this course or the dog Oh get the bounty a bit of cash and we are on to the next one just before I left this area - I did make my way over to the buy station here was checked with the heartbeat sensor and I ended up buying a self revive kit which is so important and also at UAB as I'm making my way over to a scavenger mission there's a tackler that just who's by me and jumps out at the stall here so I took a shot with the RPG destroyed the vehicle thinking well maybe I can get them at the Splash Damage using that heartbeat sensor to ascertain exactly where they are thirty meters away so I've got the direction I've got the distance I know that this person's right here but I get shot in the back which isn't good when you're stalking someone this is the worst thing that can happen so we'll take cover here have that heartbeat sensor out again it's just here in the middle somewhere so I'm looking for him jump up over the wall and they were just prone trying to cap their recon device I think not the best time to do that when you know that someone's around / maybe they needed the cash and maybe they thought that was the right move but I'm not convinced that that was the first guy that I saw in the TAC rover that got out so I'm just being really cautious here listening out and I want to clear the building because I think there might be someone in here still just checking the toilets bouncing around and I actually see someone across the way so that's definitely still not the first guy but this is what I'm talking about with the mp7 I did put a bit of damage down and I just thought you know what I don't want to really get into a prolonged firefight with this guy so I'm gonna rush him with the Jeep jumped out good of a distraction tricky fight that was because they've got the hard cover there and I'm out in the middle of nowhere we did get there in the end and I'm not gonna stay in the middle of nowhere to heal so what I do is I just get back in the Jeep and put it in reverse as quickly as possible return it to the store and then in the store we can now plate and heal up again now the next clip is quite interesting because sound in solos is actually really important you can hear a lot more so if you've got a good headset use it but listen up for a second someone behind that wall play think the sound of them doing that gave them away so be mindful of that if you're placing yourself other people can actually hear that but did you notice how much of a beam and p7 was then I just tried to counter the recall that dude didn't really stand a chance then now this point in the game I'm just moving around I'm looking for kills and I know that there's someone close to me luckily they both have unsuppressed weapons and got in a firefight showed me exactly where they were so I'm thinking well I can push this guy in the corner because he may be distracted take him out with the long shot with the mp7 other guy is still there and you know you don't always have to take every fight you can fall back sometimes so I just have a peek in case this guy's come in closer I don't really like that angle because there's so many windows and rooftops I'm just gonna fall back head into the store play this by ear see if anyone goes for that shop so I've gone upstairs and I hear footsteps yes there are footsteps in this game sometimes but for real I use home theater for me personally I've tried all of them home theater is by far the best for detecting footsteps in my opinion and exactly where that guy was and the hipfire and rate of fire on the mp7 is gonna be that guy's custom m4 any day of the week plate up pop the next UAV and just check if there's anyone else around so as I'm moving towards the next zone I'm always using the heartbeat sensor I'm always checking the obvious places where people might be and if there's a buy station I've stopped to buy a UAV and as you can see I pinged another one there and there's a guy going for that buy so this is a great opportunity to get them because I know what's at that buy station there's basically zero cover and as we're in the endgame now any kill that I get will helping towards the end the less players there are the more chance I've got of winning this thing and that's just a really easy kill for the mp7 scratch another one on there just check in behind me in case keeping an eye on that UAV will drop down and what we're gonna do is get the cash we're gonna pop that UAV again and then we're gonna buy another one for the future so this is where it starts to get really intense there's only nine people left in the game we've got multiple levels of elevation so I've got to be really careful here but I spied someone running across the sky bridge and I'm using that UAV again just to double-check that there's no one else around but you've got to be careful because people could be running goes and this guy here I really want to get this dude because when running to the next zone I want to be at the back want to be at the front so I feel like I have to take this guy out so I've been really sneaky checking all the corners off one by one and now I know that they're right next to me there they are for some reason they were prone I can get this state of the game you don't want to be in a position like that get the down and reduce them to the dog yeah that was a bit risky but it's got to be entertaining right I could have just shot him that was the smart play but rest of the rooftops seemed pretty clear now I wanted to keep the high ground here and if you look at the next zone I feel like I can I had a feeling that there was someone behind that wall and I checked with the heartbeat sensor but I think they were running goats and they're forced out of there so I was just very careful got the damage of the mp7 finish them off with that RPG but the problem with that fight is that the rest of the circle if they were paying attention knows where I am and I've got to get off this roof somehow now I could parachute off the roof but that's going to make a lot of noise there's only three other people left in the game so they would probably hear that and I chose to go down the ramp instead it's just a bit quieter get the heartbeat sensor out usually in solos at this point in the game everyone is running ghosts so it becomes kind of useless I'm looking over the wall searching for any targets suddenly I get shot in the back I thought I was going for put down some damage and because I've got an TOC and quickly switched to that off peih-gee fire the shot it destroys the vehicle the explosion kills that guy and luckily I had the self rest from earlier it was still in the inventory I beat that guy I didn't think I was going to I thought I was done for then usually most of my deaths in solo from people shooting me in the back and I was about to just stand up an alt f4 and go to bed but we made it out alive it's now a one versus one I've got a nice building in front of me and the first thing that I'm thinking about doing is clearing this building the guy could be right in here camping I don't know so we head in let's check it out we've been very very careful here left sighs clear right sides clear okay right we've pretty safe we've got some hard cover but I just don't know where this other guy is I've got absolutely no sight I haven't heard a thing but now the cookie crumbles the gas is moving in I've got a there they are on the ramp put a bit of damage down with the mp7 got to keep moving get behind the rock who fires an RPG at me and I start sweating but I did break the armor then I'm worried about that RPG because this guy could end my entire career with one well-placed shot but so far he's missed most of them so I'm feeling confident here they've gotta move because they're in the gas I get the down they've got a self revived kit and I'm thinking should I push go for the finish with the c4 I thought yeah why not just in case and the gas hens it we win the game and if you look at the name that is actually the guy that killed me earlier and sent me to the gulag that's a sweet bit of revenge to end the match that was a great game I really enjoyed that and my heart was absolutely pumping like crazy at the end but we got there and I really do think that that particular loadout and that style of play is very effective in solos I don't know if that would work in squads but in solos give it a go yourself see what you think however be mindful that most solo matches now are like this they're hyper competitive a lot of the players are very skilled so it won't be easy
