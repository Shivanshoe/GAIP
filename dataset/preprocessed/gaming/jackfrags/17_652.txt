hi everyone hope you're doing well and enjoying the weekend today's video is possibly the sweatiest most competitive lobby of warzone solos there I've ever been in it's getting really hard now and it's essentially a survival horror game at this point I hate it but I still kind of love it at the same time I'm not sharing my loadout for this match because well that would be a spoiler but you'll see why later on like the video if you have a good time watching it thank you and I subscribe if you want to see more like this enjoy I mean it's gotta be superstore doesn't it it just has to be where else would you go well they're looking at that I think a lot of people I'm gonna draw for that I'm gonna do the same yes poor guy don't even get down come on drop down cut down he said parachute they go to you through the wall pinky's below me nice mp7 the hell's that what is that what it's a proximity my mic glitching through the fall or something but it looked massive you said big it was look it wasn't that big from up there aligned to me game I'm sure there was someone in that building whatever Oh lovely I'm Thursday I just popped the dhrona okay are we I'm rude that was so much damage close that pretend it didn't happen stay inside stay safe the baby monitor out 22 metres this way was it you are you the one shooting at me well I'm screwed though because no plates guess I'll die I think we're clear if someone's already got ghosts then they're the best warzone player of ever seen oh isn't he's downstairs there and I've got no place here just run he's been plastered from the roof I kind of feel bad for that guy that's not good I'm hoping I'm banking on the fact that he gets shot from the roof and I can maybe take advantage of this one plate I mean this is spicy Gabe so far isn't it right he was still fighting on the bridge I'd love a sniper right now that'd be great he's going for plates I think yeah I don't like this not at all bingo on plates hopefully there'll be some downstairs Oh orange yes plates thank you exactly what I needed I've got enough for a low down huh can I get it though that's the question 50 meters as well as that left come on just open the crate in that garage I think literally in that garage don't think that dude knew I was here eight meters is it all right so go parachute in being shot by this guy who's not rushing in please there's a guy right there and there's someone out there ten years I should be dead I shall be dead is he pushing don't think so this has been a absolutely mad game so far do you listen and you either go shooting at me before I think and there's the load up I'm on the edge of icy right now okay oh great there's a truck going to the buy all right that guy's got a truck behind him what is going on did the truck run the guy over I think so I think that's what happened unless he's in here okay now we move this now get the guys growl mp5 this is a crazy crazy game so far what is going on all right now I'll get I'll get myself a loadout I don't really want to go to that for you want to be on this with you dammit did you have to spite me oh yeah of course show up this hour [Music] [Applause] I'm going if you hit this shot then you deserve you deserve everything I hope that you become a millionaire I'm gonna life because that would be a hell of a shot now there is a buy up here but I don't have a trophy system on this and that SUV there looks like it's been driven there all right baby monitor okay we're fine tackle overs over there hello dad I swear for someone in there I think I'm safe to get this I think I'm okay oh it's on the roof I'll start dropping in as well please give it me giving me she's going gone I think I picked the wrong loadout as well I wanted the m13 now it's a fun game though so far for sure what's that Tucker over there come on drive towards me drive towards me that's it no drive towards me I've lost my baby monitor Rosanna still not in shock my back this is an insane match I'm absolutely loving it love you love Ian let me up oh my god come on push me push me can you not close that door think you can see my laser he's upstairs it's gonna call off brokers armor let's just let's just agree to let's just stop and there's a truck okay I'm out don't have a seat done what is happening that's just the dude he was in a building the whole time oh dear right we've got guru like come on we can do this we can do this I mean this is so much pressure and stress so low is it's just horrible [Applause] [Music] yes okay right we're back in we're back in the game we're back where do we go I mean yes I think that's my only option really someone's going on here hundred-percent like a glove yeah there's someone around there that's where my scavengers go on to yes give me a decent gun you need it Angie great UAV Wow do you dare eBay this isn't even suppressed and that crosshair is disgusting Bruin that's probably better right act suppress at least I'll be off the mini-map I know for a fact guys before anything happens right let me just be real with you I know there's gonna be someone camping down there I just know it there is I just know I kind of have to go there though if I want money and loot and stuff it's any one of these buildings I guarantee there's someone camping yeah look yeah it's in it's actually in the building that I need to get to there's a guy camping in the building and now this attack over coming over and they're gonna go camp in that building you know what I'm gonna stay here for a bit I'm real I see someone know there's someone in there though I feel like I've got to get that loot I did just attract a load of attention this is where the tack rover pulled off in Munich I've never spun there so fast didn't even pick up any of the guns please okay okay ah we got lucky there we've got a lucky break all right we know the gas is coming this guy's got a pretty decent mp5 graveled by the looks of it I'm gonna go left because that is just an absolute minefield down there it's just a minefield isn't it it really is I feel so like out of it though because I don't have the baby monitor I don't have any of my perks like amped I think is the one that you missed the most because you just change weapons so much faster with that look how slow that is if anyone's got a heartbeat sensor or a UAV I'm done don't to me come to me that's not bad that's not bad I have to say but it's very open isn't it look at it I dive a sniper at some point I'm gonna have to cross that's a lot of open ground load a drop you're kidding cuz that's much shooting yeah right there I don't think I should fire at them because I would just give my position away we're gonna move through move a little bit earlier than later all right keep being stealthy open the door slowly cluster strike that could come in handy oh man I hate this so much it's like I'm playing a horror game at this point I hear someone oh man if I didn't have that mp5 then I'll be done 100% scared me it's a vector you know I'm gonna keep the mp5 should I buy something I mean self rest kit alright enemy UAV that's me screwed sulfurous just in case might as well buy some extra plates let's go this way there's a couple of rocks there that I can use I'm gonna leave it to the last second again all right here we go it's rocks almost in its got to be someone on my right some hour left okay now I think you be shooting someone in the back he says someone over there I saw some movin there wasn't just the gas I don't know I've got close to strike I think I'm gonna have to use it to push he was getting shot wasn't it this is so dodgy so glad that I bought ourself risotto if I stand up it's gotta be someone behind me looking at me surely at the side of the wall that's the guy that just slight me and killed me I think only three left [Music] it's Bush I guess got to move again three people left where are they just prone are the baby monitor gave me away oh oh I'll tell you all that solos are so so competitive now everyone's very good it's really competitive get your heart going though we really does that's good fun anyways I hope you enjoyed that guys let me know
