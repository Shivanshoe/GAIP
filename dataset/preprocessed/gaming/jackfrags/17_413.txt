today we've had an update on the development of the next battlefield game and although it seems quite simple on the surface i do think there's a lot of sub-context here too so ea released a statement earlier today and we'll take a look at it now this is from the cso laura miele our upcoming battlefield game is coming together to be an exceptional game not just for this year but also for the future of this powerful brand the project is tracking towards the franchise's earliest alpha sounds interesting the gameplay is at an unprecedented scale that sounds fun and we're taking full advantage of the technology in the next gen consoles we've heard that before the team has done an incredible job despite the challenges of working from home we want to build on our position of strength focus on the opportunity in front of us and set our game makers up for success to deliver the best experience possible to our players this fall so we are making a bold move criterion is joining dice and dice la to focus on battlefield criterion and dice have a strong history of working together and we're confident this partnership will make a great game even better so that's the headline criterion the studio based in guildford uk are now also supporting developing the next battlefield this is a pretty big deal and it does bring up a lot of questions and we'll ponder all those when we finish with the rest of the info drop with the addition of code masters we also have a massive opportunity to expand ea's racing strategy if you didn't know ea just acquired codemasters criterion is one of the strongest racing studios in the industry and the work they accomplished on the next need for speed is truly inspired and will breathe new life into one of our most storied brands we're going to give criterion the time to reach the game's full promise and deliver it in fiscal year 23. so the new criteria need for speed game delayed we're close to the one-year mark since we all began to work from home we've accomplished a lot and learnt a lot and these things are now informing our path forward one of the key learnings over the past year is it does take more time to make games from home and we have to balance that need with the team health the best way to set our teams up for success in this environment is to be focused and ensure our biggest projects have the resources they need to deliver for our players we're making a bold move for our teams to fully capture the opportunity in front of us with battlefield while maintaining the same focus on health and well-being that we've had from day one we have an exceptional year ahead with our next battlefield so we thank everyone for coming together with the energy and determination to do something special we've recently seen the first version of the reveal trailer for battlefield i would love to see that and it's shaping up to be a truly amazing first look at this groundbreaking game i think fans are going to love it so they have the first version of the reveal trailer already these things are planned months in advance but the fact that laura has said that maybe reveal will be sooner than we think fingers crossed anyway there was also a little bit more that laura said in an interview with polygon she said it's hard to make games from home and the ea dice team is fatigued a bit we have a great game and some incredible potential with this game we're playing to win we're playing to put a great battlefield game out in the market there's also a bit about dice la in here too recently we found out that dice la through one of their developers was working on the next battlefield game as well which was kind of weird because the last thing we heard they were just going to start doing their own thing but she said that daisolay have been on it for over a year and they're doing some really exceptional things in live service as we know in the past dicille have made some fantastic dlc packs for battlefield games so it could be that that's just more of what they're doing for the new game but maybe it's something different entirely laura wouldn't comment on specific features or innovations for the game other than she said that the game is a love letter to our fans and one that we want to be great we're going to put all our resources we have on this so the next battlefield game is getting a lot of gas here and this inclusion of dice la and now criterion on the game says some interesting things in my opinion first of all i think criterion are a fantastic studio they've made some brilliant racing games in the past they've worked on star wars battlefront with dice they've worked on battlefield they made firestorm which in my opinion was a fantastic battle royale mode the level design the armor system the inclusion of tanks destruction i had a lot of fun playing that unfortunately it should have been free-to-play and stand-alone everyone knew that for whatever reason didn't get any more updates after launch apart from one tiny map update and then just kind of died yeah it was kind of bare bones stripped back basic but it worked i had fun with it just never got the chance to leave the gate really but criterion being on the new project that's kind of cool they know the engine they've worked with dice before but what is it they'll be doing here well based on the languages that laura used i feel like they are going to be a studio working on the main game i don't think they'll be making a battle royale mode or anything like that as some people have already speculated tonight after the announcement because if you think about it ea saw what happened with firestorm yeah they released it wrong but they'll look at the numbers and go oh we're not doing that again they've got apex now which is incredibly successful generates a load of income for them and i don't think that battlefield needs a br game mode in the main game mode to be popular and i've always said people ask me this all the time should the next battlefield game have a battle royale mode my answer would be i'd love to see a frostbite battle royale call it battlefield battle royale but do it separately from the main game battlefield is good at conquest and sandbox and respawning having a blast experimenting and if you tie it too closely to that that starts to become a problem but if criterion were working on a separate battlefield battle royale that was free to play was standalone modern day going up against war zone destruction gun customization loadouts that kind of thing that would be incredibly successful it's just i don't know if that studio is big enough to do that and as i said ea already have apex i would absolutely love to see dice criterion daiso lake collaborate build a kick-ass free-to-play battle royale game on the frostbite engine i think it could be incredible but is it realistic for the near future i'm not so sure so i'd guess that criterion will be helping dice sweden stockholm actually get everything they need to get done before the game is released and make sure that everything's as polished and functioning as well as it can that seems like the most logical answer to me anyways and if you look at the language that you have used already about battlefield 6 they've said that they're well ahead of schedule in this interview today laura said that they've got one of their earliest alphas ever so it feels like the game might already be at a very well developed and healthy state good to go for launch so i do really think it's just all about that polish or it's the ea have planned so far into the future with this game that they've brought criterion on and dice la to just make a ton of live service content that's good to go and for once maybe battlefield will actually have decent cadence in its updates and live service that would be awesome to see this is not so great though for the need for speed fans obviously need for speeds a big franchise it's a great arcade racer if you're into that kind of thing it was ghost games making it but it came back to criterion i'm sure they've been super excited to work on that and to be releasing that but delayed a year and ea didn't say that they've took everyone off the project i think what's happened here is just they've probably reassigned a load of need for speed developers and put them on the next battlefield game instead so sad news maybe for the need for speed fans but fingers crossed that they'll give that game the love and attention it deserves when it finally gets to release and that's all for today guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below what do you think about criterion coming on board with the development of the next game and the comments that laura made the hype train has definitely left the station now i feel like we're getting updates more regularly about the next game and they did say springtime we're going to show it here first day of spring today dice please i hope you enjoyed the video guys leave a like if you did dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
