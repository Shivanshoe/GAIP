i'm really enjoying warzone again i didn't think that i'd be saying that before the new map releases and it's all thanks to this new game mode iron trials and i know that in my previous video i spelled out the rules more or less but essentially what it boils down to is they removed all of the bs from the game this mode is more tactical more skill based it's not just about who shoots first if you get shot you've got a chance to react you've got a chance to reposition to outplay your opponent out aim them with headshots because they're just so much more important now you can flank there's more teamwork involved in it and i love that i think it's great i've been playing it loads over the last couple days and what you're about to see here is a match with true game data now this is the first ever time that i played with tony and if you don't know what true game data is well he's one of the people responsible for the true game data website and he spent many thousands of hours i'd imagine at this point extracting stats from games like warzone and modern warfare and everyone uses his website for builds in warzone do you want to know what's got a quicker ttk what's better at distance better recall it's all there for you he also makes fantastic analytical videos too and i've linked his channel down in the description below if you want to click on it so this was a game of iron trials and it was action-packed from start to finish i think you guys will enjoy this one and as with the previous game i've left it mostly unedited so you can see everything that happens and all the nitty gritty in between with that said guys if you enjoyed this one leave a like as always a big thanks to all these folks using my code in the cod store jackfrags and caps if you buy anything use my code and i'll get a bit of kickback from that thank you so let's get into the game now sit back relax and enjoy i haven't heard anybody there's a lot of people dropping here behind it i think we're good this guy's coming but he's going to be late nice i don't know if he's going to get it yeah he's just going to get it right here okay i'm going to come over to you because yeah you're fine i'm 16. where'd he go nicely done uh there was a couple of orange ones at the back i've got it and in front in front he's shooting me through the thing yeah that really hurt that damage was nuts he's pushing [Applause] right here [Applause] there's one at the back of the train what they should do this guy jump oh all right oh of course all right i'm dead hey somehow missed the jump get back on the train i've got no ammo and no armor live thing here there's a guy behind me too guys on me right now [Applause] so i don't think you lose it's not possible i think so yep i've never seen you lose a good like ever so why start now i'll just flip on the chrono trigger time for a little audrey bhaji your door as well we can take that if you want to get more center zone where was it i didn't hear it i can hear it faintly right here oh yeah it's this direction above us i've got 50 days playtime in this game and i still don't know how to get around hospital there's one here [Music] all right storage wait we got an advanced i didn't think those dropped nice nine nose where's the um the cane what the hell there's no gain [Music] yeah when something gets spicy [Applause] he's dropped [Music] there's another one chasing me behind ghosted on me i'm down here [Applause] dude there's another team here i'm so dead [Applause] i think i think we're clear please no more i swear to god if i get killed here [Applause] get back in the room they're gonna go like on there and come back probably let's kill them i like that plan over here there's a load of gear i don't know where you where were you out here somewhere yeah we still have the advance they didn't take it let's go oh yeah we didn't even need it tony i know you well you didn't i could have used it but i should have used it as soon as i knew there's a ghosted guy all right well you want me to pop it or you want to yeah what do i do why not all right let's see where people are four people over there on the most wanted and then four people over here on this one make your choice let's go for these guys just two of them over there now [Applause] one's parachuting in on them it looks like yep for sure this is a sandwich right here this is what we're looking at yeah we've got i think i think the guy landed on top is a different thing with team in the king okay and then there's a team pushing across as well right now how do you want to play this i don't know are they close to that let's see if these guys are all in the open broke [Applause] he made a mistake [Applause] nice bit of natural cover here where did the other one go though there was two right i don't know yeah there were definitely two probably close to the building he's out at the front yeah two two two one's pushing watch out watch out there's another one one more yeah good job did he run back in yeah he's inside nothing on heartbeat you just broke a window here what the hell i'm gonna get with you [Applause] probably just sit in the stairs yep called it good job all right so that's three of the four people that we know maybe the other guy died i don't know sorry about your luck bro it was another one right was there another one i don't think so yeah 12 meters yeah in the building he's in the building oh no way cheeky he was a sneaky boy yeah cheeky uh recon right here what okay taking this homosexual [Applause] do you see him i want to see him i don't see him feet's still clear [Applause] moving in see him could have been an old flare strange yeah it could have been all right we're winning this game so where do we want to be we probably want to be this building maybe there's a team on blue just popped up on radar all right guy here let's kill blue he's being beam from the poor roof up here i mean we could just ignore that and just get hotel yeah i like that i'm gonna grab a uav over here yeah i feel like there's gonna be people up there though probably how much your cell phones get in precision nice i'm gonna pop it and see where people are so yeah there's a team up there yeah the guy right on us actually you want to take the kind of building here yeah let's go forward you ready mm-hmm watch our boats all they can look yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] zone [Applause] all right one might rush on that maybe i don't know it seems weird they did too seems very weird i'm just holding the heartbeat out in case they push i think i just had a wood footstep okay yeah yep yep 100 below us i can bait ghosted this is just camp building simulator now isn't it everyone's in a building you want to jump out that window i'll jump out this window will go on the bottom at the same time or you want to just wait uh i don't know i feel like it's just one though but i do yeah i agree should we go we can go yeah we go hello sir hello all right i'm gone 27 meters this building moving yeah one guy that building he was the team at the guy that we killed here the domino skin oh yeah i think there's just one in there i agree we can take it right we're doing it let's do it yeah we got this [Applause] oh well played tony good job nicely done let's go i thought there was just one in there i made the wrong quarter ghosty boys yeah that's kind of tricky my half goes with one building closer to the hotel yep all right it's looking like we'll know here in a second where it's gonna go we can rotate off that are they still poor i bet they are i'm sure they are that's how it's all all right so ideally we probably want to take hotel and then yeah i hear footsteps again okay yep 26 meters three one here and then two on like two bullets i don't know i am out of place what how did you kill an egg he must have been hurt from something [Applause] well this is awkward we go oh we wait let's go under let's go under apartment under
