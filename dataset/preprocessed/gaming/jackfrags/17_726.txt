hi everyone hope you're doing well and looking after yourself and others in these strange times today we are playing some battlefield 3 now I wanted to go back and play this game today and share some thoughts on a particular topic that we've talked a bit about in the Call of Duty war zone live streams that I've been doing recently because I know not everyone can watch those live streams because maybe they're busy maybe they just don't want to sit through two hours of Call of Duty whatever it might be so I wanted to condense everything we've been talking about into a 10 minute video here and also get your guy's opinion on this too so I haven't wrote a script for this video I just wanted it to be live commentary my raw thoughts and feelings on this first of all let me just say that hindsight is 2020 and no one can accurately predict the future unless someone's a secret time traveler and just hasn't told anyone but I think the battlefield 3 dice had something really really special here with this game especially when you consider the fact that this game came out in 2011 and just how crazy and sandbox it is and I feel that maybe the last couple of Battlefield games have lost some of this it was just so far ahead of its time this game I mean even today I'm playing this on PC it's maxed out ultra graphics it still looks really good yes some of the animations maybe you've dated a bit but as I'm watching this back and as I was playing it I'm thinking to myself you know this actually looks a lot better than some games that are coming out today and of course you've got the destruction on top of that to which a lot of other multiplayer first-person shooters either by design are just because of technical limitations aren't doing still the gameplay though is the most important element of why this game was so much fun it's that sandbox that combination of infantry on the ground the majority tanks infantry fighting vehicles Jeeps and then in the air you've got helicopters which we'll talk about later and jets just a great mix that worked really well together a lot of that was also thanks to the level design it's still fun even today there is still populated service on PC I imagine there may be even more on console too so why has this come up then well that topic of Call of Duty war zone that we've been talking about in the streams it's a loss of what Cod war zone is doing now and the reasons that people are having so much fun with it bf3 was doing in 2011 now of course you can't compare the games directly it's apples and oranges right but there are a lot of things that are similar here and a lot of this stuff people who don't play or have never played the Battlefield games are experiencing for the first time and you know what I'm talking about the crazy clips that we've seen in Call of Duty where people drive over each other with trucks or they put c4 on quad bikes and jeeps and jump out at the last second detonating getting squad wives putting c4 on your friends UAV drone who then flies it into an enemy squad and gives you a countdown three two one you detonate it explodes parachuting from the sky and doing takedowns on people from behind flying around in helicopters and shooting rockets down towards the ground maybe the helicopters about to explode so you jump out and as you're parachuting down and whip out an RPG and take out a jeep full of three people that's moving along the road but you just hit that perfect prediction shot and take everyone out inside it and it just feels great or it could be insane long-range sniper headshots that you're hitting across the map all of those things that I've just talked about you could do in this game you could do that in bf3 arguably you could do more of it in bf4 as well plus you have the Destruction stuff on top but I think it's because of how accessible Cod war zone is it's free-to-play its standalone it's cross-platform there are no barriers there and I think a few days ago they announced they already have 30 million players and the game has only been out like two weeks or something so it's obviously already a huge success and I'm sure the Activision and Infinity Ward Raven whoever are working on it will continue to support it and it will grow and grow and become way bigger than it currently so it's bringing in a lot of people to this battlefield style of gameplay that maybe they didn't know existed or they never thought was fun before and bringing this back to what I said right at the start of the video I really do feel that bf1 and ba5 have missed a lot of that that special battlefield source that sandbox you could say well yeah that's because of the time periods that they were setting bf1 is a world war one game they didn't really have RPGs or block on missiles or helicopters but at the same time with BF 1 you could do some Sun boxing things of course you've got dynamite you had horses you had the airships so there is some element of that there but it's just not on the same scale with BF 5 things are a lot more grounded and that was seemingly by design of the game everything was very intimate and hardcore and more tactical and you couldn't really do those crazy things that you used to in the latest Pacific update yes we've seen a few more of those sandbox style things like the katana and the flamethrower more vehicle customizations for example and I'm really interested to see if and where battlefield 5 goes next because they've talked about this sandbox initiative before would be a five and said that they are focusing on it now so whether it's the eastern front or something else whether it's secret weapons of world war ii to shake things up a bit I don't know but I really hope that it becomes more of a big fun toy box again and one thing that I mentioned earlier was level design you've seen in this video I've been playing on Caspian Border and cog Island both of these maps have massive towers and places that you can get to which are really high up as I was playing this earlier sniping from the top of the Caspian border town I was thinking to myself you know it'd be a five I can't think of a map which has that level of elevation in it and again that could be by design but it does limit a lot of player choices one other thing that definitely limits the sandbox style gameplay of battlefield 5 is the fact that it's a world we'll sue game and there are no helicopters I think this is a really interesting point hypothetically speaking if you've added helicopters to battlefield 1 or battlefield 5 would that make the game more fun in sandbox I think it would because it opens up so many more opportunities yes of course it wouldn't be realistic and I'm not saying that that I should have added a helicopter in world war 1 it just doesn't make sense but the difference is with bf3 and bf4 and modern combat games like cod warzone transports helicopters are the glue that sticks the air and the ground together they bridge that gap that nothing else can they're somewhere in the middle and they open up this entire player space that just wasn't accessible before transport helicopters allow you to quickly jump in a squad and get from A to B way quicker they allow you like we talked about earlier to attack targets from an angle that you've created open space from the book yeah you know it's risky because they might have a stinger or shoot you out the side of the helicopter but it's an angle that other players weren't expecting and that's another element in the sandbox and I was thinking earlier what's the relationship between planes and infantry in battlefield 5 is it really that fun or does it open up many opportunities for gameplay I don't really think it does if you're an infantry player one in every 10 shots from a Panzerfaust or a bazooka you might hit that plane and it's an awesome moment right but most of the time for infantry your relationship with planes is being killed without having the chance to react and usually it's meaningless because in VF 5 medics can revive so quickly and efficiently there's no cooldown on it that even though that plane has killed you if you get revived you've not lost that ticket anyway so all that pilot is doing is just inflating their kill death ratio it's not actually having that much of a viable impact on the match and it's not that fun to be on the receiving end of it either I'm sure there are some pro pilots out there who absolutely love going 110 and zero whatever it's only the minority though maybe two or three people per match on a team so with that in mind let's say hypothetically again bf5 adds attack helicopters it adds attack helicopters and transport helicopters the transport helicopters give the infantry something to do another angle to attack and travel around the map the attack helicopters they get to attack infantry and they also get to attack other airplanes that means now that airplanes aren't just focused on killing other airplanes and infantry they've got another threat another element to worry about helicopter section is over with now to summarize because of the time eras that be f1 and bf5 were set helicopters weren't in the game and I think transport helicopters in particular are an essential pillar of Battlefield games and it's really fun to once again be doing the kind of things that me and my friends did when we played bf2 and bf3 back in the day now then I'm gonna think about roughing this commentary up because I don't want to take up too much more of your time it's already been about 10 minutes or so but I suppose the inspiration for this came from plain Cod war zone and having those sandbox moments that we used to have all the time in games like bf3 and bf4 yes they're not battle royale games the gaming industry has changed a lot but a lot of the mechanics the principles they're all exactly the same it's just been opened up to this massive new audience and that's really good it's great for Call of Duty because their style of gameplay and the people that are playing Call of Duty games is changing I know so many people that didn't play bf1 and ba5 and are now just hardcore in war zone because of how much like the old battlefield games it feels like and I want whatever comes next for battlefield in fiscal year 2022 which let's be honest it may be delay now because of what's happened I want that game to be a massive return to form for battlefield and I want it to feel like that old-school fun sandbox game again dice had something with bf3 and for whatever reason a lot of that classic battlefield DNA has been lost along the way and I hope that they can get it back with that said thank you so much for watching guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if
