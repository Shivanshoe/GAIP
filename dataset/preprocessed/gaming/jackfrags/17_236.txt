warzone has had one of the best turnarounds for me personally in just the last week and that's all thanks to the iron trials if this is the future for the game with an enhanced focus on balance tactical gameplay and anti-chi i'm all in but whether that comes to fruition for the main game we'll have to wait and see either way today is a special one this was the best round of iron trials that we've played so far the ending in particular has some very heated firefights in and moments where it seems like all is lost we came up against some good players and i'm using the cold war ak and modern warfare bison would you believe it and playing here today with pawnee hof he recommended me to try that bison and it worked fantastic now this was our first time on warzone together and we just had a tremendous chemistry that worked brilliantly for this game mode it was a blast and if you want to check him out i've linked his channel down in the description below he does some great videos on loadouts and is full of useful knowledge tips and tricks about the game with that said no messing around today we're getting straight into the action if you have fun watching the video do consider leaving a like and a comment down below so the great youtube algorithm in the sky actually shows this video to people also cheers to these legends using my code in the cod store here we go then some tactical iron trials i think you'll like this enjoy did you learn some new british phrases from playing this game i bloody this bloody that bloody there but but i do play i do play a lot with british people like with benny and my buddy yuki and so on yeah so it feels like i i have any ways too much british already around too me working my ball of water oh that's the classic one that's what the americans say isn't it yeah that's that's the most important thing to learn when you interact with british people same elevation as us ow oh my god he's absolutely ruined me i got his friend down is he pushing you yes but i'm good [Applause] right here right here good support there oh lower lower oh my god i'm down i'll hide [Applause] that that must have been close dude uh yeah he he oversprayed pretty much good job i was just watching the health bar it was more more like that scale so i'll take it [Applause] that that legendary that legendary like freaking kafar you find that's that's pretty baller there's a box right here and it's annoying me i'm going this way you can't find it oh it's above me like it's on your elevation but i can't get it i'll get it i was in los angeles once at a hotel and i asked for a bottle of water and the guy didn't understand me did you do it intentionally very british no i just said can i get a water please and he was like why what do you mean i oh okay water what do you want from me can i get water there's a guy here they're hard teeth they need to be spoken what plane i think that's the same guy teamwork yeah he was the only one that made it from the gulag the thing is as a german speaking english i often like i just can't be asked to pronounce the t's hard so i end up like making d's out of the t's also your english is very good anyway i mean i think it's so thank you it's all about getting rid of the german accent then you're then you're good to go okay we get enough we get enough do it [Applause] did you learn from a very early age i was wondering in america as a kid but i've pretty much been been just gaming in english like literally since i'm since i'm 11 just gaming in english that's cool oh people people are coming from here [Applause] i'm flashed want the truck is it the truck phony on your left thank you very much sorry i'm not the other one i couldn't talk i've got you [Applause] scrotinger and steve rovers and they bring us even more money yay let's go there's 11k there if not like someone just randomly snuck in and stolen this is mine now oh here's more for uav okay they caught a load out there i guess we don't want to go there because unless you want to fight on top of that building let's have a look request recall flyover i just got spotted by a drone it's their drone i hear it i'm gonna try to run up here because maybe they're both gonna peek the roof okay i got the drone the drone oh i love the sound of that so good be advised uav you got the boat i'm gonna come prepared for this oh good excellent i don't know if we want to push this because they get a command i'm taking the back side here on me [Applause] lightning on the roof on the tiny corner of the roof he was just sitting up there oh he fell down very empty oh i missed it he was like with his arms left and right waving out like oh do you want to buy another yui just straight left here why not it's funny here in the comms in this game mode because people aren't really used to the time to kill yet and even if you've cracked someone you hear them go oh he's one he's one he's you know like you actually take a lot of bullets sorry he just ran on it didn't have time to talk that was good one more left okay we're rich official i get the uav pop mine because i want to keep my combat bow i pop a munitions box you want to sell for uh yeah sure if you could give me five honeys or how much ever it is take it all do you think they will change normal warzone and implement some of these decisions i thought about it but but if we're real warzone is an effing casual game and they can't do it because then every casual gamer is gonna be like ee yeah they should make it permanent though because this is essentially ranked mode so yeah yeah actually makes me care about the game a bit more i can can you imagine playing this in quads it i think they'd need to increase the ammo ball in quads i guess we want to get ahead of them because we essentially have to cross all the way oh this is all falling out see this is what i like about the boat that we don't have the chance to get like just a truck and make a safe crossing we pretty much gotta be smart and cross like over this i found some lethal forget my life someone's beaming [Applause] oh no okay we're screwed they're running across the airfield as well to our right our bounty if they're getting shot at we should move [Applause] [Applause] if you make it two meters further yeah i'm good i'm good let's go [Applause] there's a guy down here in the valley do you want to
