played I'm won Jack from real life here I bet you weren't expecting me were you I wanted to show you this so ei actually sent me this little statue it's one of the Ravens that's in the game at the moment for the Bloodhound event unfortunately it turned up and the beat was broken so just just one of those things apparently some other content creators got one of these and the beats were broken too and some people thought it was like an easter egg and it might be something hidden on the inside but everyone was too scared to take a look on the inside because didn't want to break the statue but I made a hole in mine guys there's nothing in there all I've done is break even more I'm ruined anyway thanks for watching the video I love you bye
