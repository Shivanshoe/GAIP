everyone and welcome back to more call of duty warzone today we are going to be using the ffar and this is the loadout that i've got a couple days ago they secretly buffed a couple of the barrels and today we're going to be using the task force barrel and this i think is the fastest assault rifle in the game and if my memory serves me correctly it will beat a mac 10 at close range so it's pretty dangerous right now and we'll be pairing it up with a car 98 and today playing with the legendary study westy and tactical brit it's going to be a good session today looking forward to it and i think that combination of ffar and car 98 will be lovely for quads should be a good time i've just realized as well that my mouse is on the wrong dpi so i'm gonna have to change that can't use 1600 dpi on the desktop there we go that's better just crazy to use on the on the desktop because it's way too fast that feels good welcome guys thank you for coming hello cindy i did yeah rhys ellie slabby what's up welcome to the video if you're watching my favorite news actually out of all the cold war guns i'd say it's my favorite even more than the mac 10 just because it's a bit more versatile because you get a bit of range on it and at close range it's uh pretty devastating [Music] taylor thanks for the two is meant to be doing uni work well let's get on with it mate get on with it come on it's important for your team maybe you'll lead them in maybe it is be advised gas is closing in proceed it's most certainly you say this is not a good idea no it's never a good idea jack okay we'll see how it goes we might be okay we might be all right here out the sky he hates i shot him i shot him he's going away yes get the choker [Music] i got another one i got a sigma and he simply doesn't want the smoke um trying to jump up this here we go we got two i got a sigma look we're the chunkiest squad right now in the game all of the launchers everything you could possibly want you can go to the spy station right here yeah yeah do it oh lowly he coming oh loady he's coming lackey's got the money all on his own look at that yeah that's a good start to the game oh lucky [Laughter] stops at it he's at it i'm still scared of it even though it doesn't kill you anymore i got shot from the north from north i don't know 100 thing happened the other day my go slowly landed on the train let's go for the rest of the gas again for the rest now all right bro here and hey nice i've got an airstrike where else i don't have an angle on these guys really there's one in this house here jack heading there [Music] one in the house on that red mark i actually destroyed that vehicle okay he's not big there is any speaking broke he's broke but he's good you guys on my phone he's out the back may have gone back in the front door up an atc now as well oh you're so jammy he's like last inch of health i got you lucky oh that was close on the rest there it was close got him as he ran upstairs through the window look at all this gear here oh my god there's so much gear in here yeah there's loads of gear oh red access keycard or you say there was something atc stuff yes there is there they dropped in okay i'm looking i'm looking i do not see um there's a little bit more gear back up the hill here i don't know what we got ah it's ground loot scramly ground luke yeah someone on airport got their loading i see a bunch of tracers above oh that is miles away yeah it's a lot of different on the car 98 there i've got a mini box now guys crack that guy crack two you kidding relocating right there guys snipes easy slides yes yeah they're on the they're on the loadout aren't they bad they work out over there should we go take atc well there is the guy up there ah we'll i must say this round is already feeling much better than the ones we've had previously praise be the pyramids phase be the pyramids yeah somebody want to airstrike that no i haven't seen anyone peek it once by the way guys so there's definitely nothing there yeah 28 meters he's up there he's just camping yeah he will just be me if you go up the lift i'm just saying he could kill all that he's literally he's literally just camping the top of the lift there's yeah it's not really a good idea to go up there should we go at the airport roof yeah oh we see salad salad and a busty salad in the pasture okay let me go filthy powder it sounds a bit like uh andy millman from extras when he's in the show got him oh oh okay yeah i mean we want to move up anyway how did you sneak up there uh if you put your heartbeat sensor on the edge of the elevator you can tell when he's on the top or if he's watching interesting yeah but did he have salad in his pasty luck one that's the thing i think he did that's why he's dying it's a bit of a sin isn't it really salad in a pasty things you don't do cardinals in players here got that one that was shot here there's one back in the door the roof could be someone roof no they're fighting they're fighting in there and yeah though dry skin bryce oh he's around me hit one right here guys right here he's low ah sorry jack you're so precise went from zero to 100 real quick didn't it then stodd's dead west is dead lachlan's dead we're all dead it's because we were talking about salad in the past that's why not paying attention what's the matter this week oh i hate this vlc bro you're done here so annoying you're up soldier [Applause] [Music] yeah we are as far away as we could be literally uh he is left us steady let's do a dance left left in the middle someone's just got their loadout prison i landed three shots on him how did you manage to kill me i landed three shots would go poor maybe sod i think that's the plan yeah melt it about that yeah both of us got melted of course they gave me the most ineffective gun in the gulag the x-16 pistol i'll stop son loading oh didn't you see it and they just got oh no that's um there's a load out in front of you to the south as well yeah and they've just dropped on that someone's just dropped on that load out to the south side yeah we need to find a couple of plates uh should we you've got a supply run but it's over the other side and you guys need ammo as well you need ammo this hasn't been loaded we highly ideally need one res at least because otherwise the stuff's going to be out of the gas there you go you got enough for a res um okay into the buy here yeah do you think go right to there oh no there's a buyer someone's just bought there okay you guys can push back up you can guys can go that way but you'll have to go quick maybe do a little bit more looting see if you can find any more money this goes done all right even if you get one player that's better than nothing oh my god it's solitary unbelievable oh it's jeff unbelievable jeff i don't know what happened i hello what's happened jeff we don't rightly know uh yeah top of these top of these fuelly lads there's always some uh

take this by this vehicle is not normally on this hill over here i think they do i mean i think you need to get across this open area here rather than like camping over here so trying to get across that's not going to be easy it's me and lackey just about in the sky yeah that truck is still over there as well yeah that truck is now here and it's being shot by people from covert don't really know what the play is here i mean this hill might be all right located a vehicle moving there oh you guys have no guns so never mind we got nothing nothing left got nothing left oh god there's somebody parachuting in the next day oh my god has he just shot i just killed one over on that red marker jack i gotta dive is there anyone else on the wall on the wall guys on the wall i'm nicking their guns

get the respawn it's going to come back in yeah do we want to push all the way through to the right target right here you can do there he is safe if we want to dip we need to go on the right hand side and we need to go as well yeah i guess yeah we need to go now we're going towards yellow house orange we need to go you don't want to be on the edge of that gas guys i'm tempted to try and drive into them you want to be a battery and i'm dead they didn't miss the shot nope and he's got a head shot from that far away what that was insane i'll put fire station camera [Applause] i don't know how he did that same beam he was just called out to his friends that i'm right here even i know what uh he's over here here firing an air max he was on the back side there yeah oh nice all right guys guys

fire station there's a whole squad up on purple yeah i think they're glimming yeah they are well at least you've got a position here now yeah you're gonna have to clear purple team because they're gonna run straight into you nicely done that's awesome i don't know what the lighting's like the line is crazy today super bright it's super bright we might need that jeep okay i don't know thinking exterior will wear oh what the hell um what the it's what was he doing this is tempting come on pretty rough hold on let me just uh you need to make a change make that change well i wanted to do a smile spr this round but no it wasn't allowed i got killed at every opportunity did you see about weetabix and baked beans like what are they doing well it's just uh advertising it they've pogged it why would you put big baked beans on wheat bits come on come on now i mean i'm sure there's some uh people up north who are privy you know smash a can of baked beans on their wheelbags you think people would actually do that i've seen some pretty awful things in my time up north i once saw a man put ketchup on a roast dinner that's bad that one is bad it's just not acceptable is there well like yeah well like squeezy mustard on some beef that's an old people thing though isn't it like i'm pretty sure my granddad used to do that but amer american business american mustard just normally making hot dog mustard and putting it on something [Music] oh man well that was a sweaty first game wasn't it stream band play notification notification that's different man would yeah yeah i basically i've reported that many cheaters and they all got banned i've got that band player notification forever there it is good try thank you anthony uh reuben today we're using the car 98 and the ffar what do you think of the fennec addition it's okay it doesn't have enough bullets though especially when you're playing in chords duos solos yeah it's okay but trios and chords not so much anyone agree they should patch out the sun yeah fuzzy though get rid of the sun are you using a a yeah i'm using sm one times good afternoon energizer how you doing uh runner max if you want to see the ffa r build go to the start of the video i did it right there hey nugget uh de long thank you for becoming a member uh thanks for the two richard and luke thank you for becoming members as well potato thanks for the five how's the lambo i don't have a lump i never buy a lamborghini map waste of money in my opinion i wouldn't spend that much money on a car the way i think about cars is they get you from a to b that's it i don't love cars like i mean i can appreciate a nice looking car battle royale i wouldn't spend that much cash on a vehicle [Music] next recon contract my friend eats salmon with ketchup no that's not the one come on or graphics card rtx 3090 emiliano let's get this one that's one man one desire one man and his pog went to kill the sweat zone you can't kill the sweatshirt you don't want to become it went to absorb the sweat sign you simply become part of the problem i was born on the sweat melbourne oh lucky's picking up the ginger crate if i found them picking up the gingers i found a ground loop pelly that just keeps on killing if we do this we should probably have enough never see that there that heli like if that was any other sniper i literally i could i could aim on that heli and get the shot that that was still still still too slow you're using the pelican uh i just got the ground loot one enemy i do have these there's a pellington that's better than the car 98 isn't there not really really for close range close range yeah the scoping speed's like 150 milliseconds slower so you basically get quickscope before you can aim it so it's clicked well but it's good but it's not better 100 the carnegie absolute pogba and you mean to tell me that my own chat we're incorrect i'm shocked that they think well i thought the chat was the fountain of knowledge let's go get this boys let's go uh yeah on the left make something i get trucky lad i'll get chucky i've got the wheel i'm still reeling about ketchup on a roast ketchup right is it a salad that's an equivalence i mean you want it's just gravy surely yeah it's gravy and if it's not gravy then it's mint sauce yeah maybe a bit of mint sauce yeah but yeah but if you're not going to have ketchup if you don't like ketchup then you just put some mint sauce on it and you're getting the right sort of feeling red sauce yeah okay it's not quite sourced though really it's cranberry sauce bread sauce is not really sauce it's like a lumpy mess bread yeah oh god it's good but it's just a lumpy mess i might do that peli the peli loadout oh i got it cranberry they put that on like swedish meatballs and turkey sometimes right i thought that was loganberry is it lingenberry jam or something lingard logan paul berry loken balberry joe on blue we have blue yes i see him he's on the left of it he was peeking like a little duck duck right i'm heading over here to get to the roof to get a little bit of an angle on these lads okay mint sauce yeah this horse is uh great yeah mint sauce is brilliant you're missing out if you're not using that oh player dropping in on roof uh lachlan has disconnected sounds like that that was that felt like a bit of a drop out there crash maybe internet gone yeah trio's enduro uh squads let's go we can make that that means it'll be easier or less zombies yeah lackey has left your party i think the cat might chew the cable yeah a villainous cat meow enemy sighted enemy excited fortune right here right i don't know whether to be annoyed or impressed oh what happened there he um turned off the network switch yeah he poured he pulled the plug socket and turned off the network switch wow ruth run and then there's one more there's yeah he's jumping he's jump sniping here moving oh the truck on green yeah behind green left behind don't pick me up in the right mind that's on the roof that's ruth yeah i'm running this footsteps in here by the way i'm blue okay yeah going to look now i can't see because there's a sign in the way constantly there's a guy in blue as well there's a guy in blue marker yeah that's a cdl skin with a sniper down am i down how nice well done hold on got him nice lads well played i didn't get a single kill there that's how good the peli is what do you put on a penny then in the loadout um yeah basically it's a close range sniper that you need to use it under 100 meters for it to feel effective basically is that true i got one already i'm good i hear someone stod outside my building looking towards south east not sure yeah yeah more lethals here [Music] but i'm using one of the base barrels which um has been buffed so it's now 600 meters per second plus the monolithic suppressor which is another 25 so you're looking at like 750 maybe so like mid-range it's fairly competitive there's not might be a go on this route i can that's where that shots i can see shots coming from it but is it the one behind the green roof at um uh behind gas station knowing the little side bit there's one here jack on that marker wanna head over there that'd be green it's pain it's pain there's a jeep on the other side these buildings are going up to twins by the log sir oh okay maybe going for the bike i've not seen anyone at twins on the roofs or anything we could do with um what you call it self-resist it's a very healthy healthy lobby it is a healthy lobby lackey's left and therefore it's left the the difficulties lowered i'm sad that a lot of americans don't know what yorkshire pudding is and they've never had it oh have you ever had a yorkshire pudding wrap and then inside it it's all of the sunday lunch overpowered too much damage you can't have that often yeah that's too much stuff [Laughter] roast they're on twins they're on twitter i can just buy a second loadout if you want no no we'll go over to the hill because there's a guy on it yeah yeah all right stop get it get it crystal oh no i don't know i've already bought something right ruins yeah and ripperoni they're coming up the hill they're coming up the hill now they're on the hill now yeah we're in a bad position and they're on they're on the loadouts right now yeah so what you're saying is that me being kicked out one might one of them may be a problem one of them just got ghost one of them's just gone yeah i just saw that they are getting the lady there they did get their loadie and they've run away um well then i'm right when i left uh right when one's underneath left right now yeah and they are they've rested so i'll just use the strike on them yeah and go for two there there's two there there's two down now on that one what happened here how did i not get the kill and i got a different kill what do you mean there's two there should be two guys down right here yourself maybe but it was i did it literally instantly as soon as i shot him and it did a reverse sweep if you know what i mean [Applause] yep i'm running away jack okay from hospital hell hang on i'm recovered hospital hill was it i don't see they missed you i can stun if they come towards you someone's raised we just came from by the way i don't see any others i'm halfway upstairs on the the twin although that's a uav going off i'm down because there's a guy with a milano [Music] jacket [Music] why has that not broken his plates in the gas cam he's gonna oh god there's another one there's another one on my left they're literally just hiding yeah they've all just hidden and just waiting around corners survive and you can redeploy i forgot there was four i forgot we were in quads tonight come on i've just shot at him and i've there's still three of them alive [Applause] or [Applause] [Applause] ah i didn't know he'd gone around there yeah we just yeah pull off okay yeah we'll just pull off that that was a pull off rice right lucky

dear uh lucky you're joining where's he gone i sent him a dm he did say sent about sending him a dm just queue up if he's not around i just said come back we're dead lol it's quite funny battlefield tweeting about leaks yeah i saw that go to elite jail well i mean it's a good way for them to just like keep control of the conversation there's nothing official out there other than what ea have said at the moment so you know i think it's good man not having any any clue whatsoever what's coming it's a good feeling back he says play around without him okay he's having to deal with the cat meow meow that that sounds exactly like what's happening we've got a ton of new members that much guys thank you so much toffster jamie up to kapla that's a cool name hendrick bintang appreciate you guys thanks to the 10 hendrick sebastian where's the lamb sauce i don't know grab some target practice while you can alex welcome guys uh malt thanks for the five what's the ffa i built i just showed it hardly that's the meta build right now you recommend rpgs for solo as a secondary yusuf it's an interesting choice i think you need an ar though but you also need an smg or something that fires fast so you could do ffa rpg but rpg is nowhere near as good as it was australia's pretty good more accurate fires quicker down in one hit even if they've got eod so you know maybe ffa australia or something like that but i'd be taking an assault rifle in a sniping silos solos i've got also on the side of my tongue you guys ever get ulcers on your tongue play time's over so painful it's like it's on the bottom right hand side so it's underneath on the right hand side and whenever i talk it's like grinding against my teeth so it just hurts it's making me like mess my words up and everything i put some of that bongela stuff on it you know that's supposed to numb it but it's it's already worn off battle royale it's annoying avoid the gas get to the safe zone i'll live with it could be worse [Music] apparently some people like pop them or they burst them with their teeth or they poke them and that supposedly helps to get rid of them but i've never done that before i don't want to do that that'd be painful as hell also the torture yeah your mate's a rose skin tell him he's a banker all right lads let's get it done uh oh wow never thought i'd get to meet america the world's gone mad jack we can't i don't think four out three is ever going to happen yeah you know you know when you know when tommy plays rek fest yeah i always thought that was a bit like when borat does the foot race footsteps oh where are these guys might be used i think it's gaming i've got my rpg ready just in case you know a bit of covering fire yeah here it's uh cdl pro he's down what i'm thinking this got ruined i was gonna say dude you know when you get the hit marks after they're already down yeah just like what he had no idea if they're down did he die because he's now threatened oh twice the double ttb i've never seen it before but yesterday we had the yt ttv clan tag they've never seen such a moving position it's abhorrent you've got a problem there son okay yeah we're just

the moment yes and a repeat of yesterday when we held the roof for like 10 minutes that sounded closely close on prison there's a guy there i can't ping it it's too far okay that's fine moving he's going up the ladder i've been sniping quite a few times please be aware i'm gonna get up on the the big big lad roof oh i've got the wrong gun yeah i've got my xm4 oh great weapons i've got to growl is all right and i hate myself using it he's a little bit better i'm gonna get back on a crane yeah or we could uh i should have should have bought herself self-resides are in order maybe go to the other bar yeah you can get to the other buy for sure i'm on the big roof here so if anyone comes across that heli snipe was dirty by the way you was it a one shot standard yeah one shot with the peli 3x scope as well nice what's up tulshi how's it going man pretty good loadout yeah yeah it's it's pretty decent car 98 and for far all meta right now very quiet right now 46 players left it's going to be quiet for the next circle i reckon because there's no point anyone rushing around at the moment is there just gonna get myself for us you see bullets going across there we'll get should we get crazy the one next to the chat the sniper stream sniper's dream there's no one up at park this dirty sniper position got us exactly zero kills in warzone there's a heli coming in over there 600 meters away all right ten credits you get him oh i hit him you get too quick for a hit who could have hit okay you'll not see me crush those enemies positions very exposed it's not enjoyable england [Music]

the two buildings right can't see the angle yeah oh there's the tracers from along here on green literally hit he's running movement he's down the bus yeah maybe we should think about moving now because we've been shot out by like three different squads yeah probably because otherwise we just leave ourselves exposed up here it's hard to get off these cranes if people are looking at you and below us yeah we're ruined they managed to creep up below us repositioning do you want to get one of the bounties that's nearby enemy marked 480 meters yeah these cranes are so you get so much vision

for becoming a new member chris cheers to the fire you and the boys having any pancakes today you know what chris i don't have any pancake mix so i might have to go and buy some i have to make that a uh possibility later on cj thanks to the five kyle and i seem gaming thank you for this 20. what's up grace games happy to catch you live jack uh zero we've got four now we're playing with tactical brit to start but he uh he's cat he's just got a little kitten and the kitten pulled out the power connector on the ethernet switch so he uh disconnected for a game i showed the ffa loader right at the start several you can skip on the on the vod if you want what's with the recons are they meta basically if you're in like a high skill bracket um because of the type of lobbies you get put in basically if you don't play to win then you're gonna have a bad time so the the best thing to do is just get as many recons as you can and just find out where the final zone is so you can just move up there like here it's going to end up already or around here somewhere so that's what we try and do now because if you're playing just like run around like a headless chicken with scavenger crates or bounties or whatever you might get a lot of kills but you're going to die you're going to go to the gulag that's a different game now to when it launched a year ago it's nearly a year for warzone man

need to push around to westchester all the way to the right is that the play to setting where we are down one as he jumped they were literally because they know because they know that we can't finish them so this is the white house white house moving position yeah i'm a hit where's the sniper i'm blowing over there on the from somewhere else vehicle around you need to we need to buy an airstrike and throw it on there again i can the beam they've got a max there they're not stupid i've put the air strike on it going for the res yeah don't don't underestimate these guys yeah max he's speaking with the window jump down careful oh look who we killed him pushing watch out yeah truck coming back try coming back no did he jump through the window there lucky what did he do oh okay he's right there careful there might be one more the mac 10. someone guarantee it there's guys on the hill i think i spotted over here we have to move soon i'm not entirely sure but i'm going to move right there let's move right then down here if you need him fill up on plates on ammo we're good to go somebody's just loadout dropped yeah i heard that that was rough man needed my gear what's up carl yeah struggle that is like when you come back from gulag like that and you've got to run for the gas and you don't have your loadout as well no ammo no plates all publicity guys i think it's it phil thank you for becoming a member what's up bro uh michael h thank you for the 80 that's very kind always thoroughly enjoy the streams my favorite youtube without a doubt much love from australia legend michael i hope you're okay up there i got a uh i gotta buy dpi 1600 today uh i'm trying to keep my eyes towards the block yeah they're on the compound i'm going to try and snag some gear from here stud yeah yeah that's fine that's fine i didn't used to be able to get all your gear back i didn't have any um yeah i killed a couple of guys though should be dead easy hit one they're coming over we gotta go wide right right from somewhere else oh boys compound no no no no no i have to reload we have to go through them that's fine we can loot we can look to the right we can loot to the right yeah we've got an option yeah it's not the easiest route though they still have angles from the windows yeah but we just go far right with uh yeah use this little hill here there's a hill here if you can keep behind that you should be be careful because there might be more people to all right there's gonna be people everywhere at this point now oh it's it's it's roots the sweat level uh we've got glinters from that's the team yeah we're going to want to go all the way right and trying um flank around oh oh that was close i'd ride with my head i think there are as long as people [Music] okay i think we should take this building here i think it's gonna be a hillside end zone yeah yeah which is why i don't want to commit too far in and and we've still got 29 players in the circle here guys there's lots of teams lots of pogba's lots of poggers this is insane we have to get a win how many kills you got lucky 27 i wasn't far off and that doesn't include like the 16 people i down to the start and then them blood out yeah i get that i feel that there's an orange crate on that roof yeah i'm gonna see if i can get relocated get the jinji all right we're good we're good satchel here if anyone needs it i'm on the race we're in a prime time position here lads it's just where is everyone else uh they were fighting to ourselves just beam it push straight oh he's getting absolutely minced him found him he's not gonna be happy has anybody got spare plates by the way i've already got one i'm just low on plates generally speaking anybody need a sniper ammo or rocket launcher or shotgun no i am i'll take that take some of the snoy paramo right uh where do we go next oh the zone's still coming in yeah we're good i think it's smart not to commit to the hillside too early there's people shooting from hillside down into i'm a hit i don't quite get him it's other people shooting back at them hit on the here let me know i'm good man okay we will have to commit to hills shortly well do we want to go now um i think it's worth us getting to this building and holding it there's shots over to the right that's the problem i just got shot at loads okay we just gotta hold this building roughly people at the top here bloody hell that was a good mark there's people running across here i'm worried about our rights stud there's a loadout here i can see i could see southeast becoming problematic here play across here that one bloody knew it found it anybody got any spare ar yes stopping thank you he just killed all the bullets he's ever getting i think there's people going to be just ahead of us so careful i can carve that statement it's definitely people they weren't they were there with it they just held an air strike somewhere hit down here pumping i'm thinking i'll pick one thing two guys three guys i'm gonna run out of almost they are enemy marked i can drop you some stacks come here thank you don't wanna hold these guys [Music] anybody else got any ar now because now i'm low i think we're all pretty low on that 60 more there i put it somewhere around here is there's going to be a squad in front of us here i don't see it westy oh damn it well

just downing them we weren't finishing them off no [Music] uh who's playing row is me and luck on the plane yeah ffa is my main loadout it's really good beyblade it's really good we don't talk about fortnite in here you can talk about fortnite with ninja i don't think ninja even knows who i am i don't really like fortnite as a game anymore it was fun when it came out when you know people just built things at a normal speed but then if you didn't keep playing it and keeping up with the meta and the builds and the keybinds and everything just fall behind so quickly like the the amount like the speed at which those kids can edit stuff and build stuff it's crazy like absolutely insane i kind of i didn't like it when they added bots either like when you play a competitive game and then they add bots it's not satisfying anymore because you're like well did i kill a bot or did i kill a person i'm not interested in killing bots you know in a pvp game especially bots that are masquerading as real players which is what happens in fortnite right and in pub g battle royale i'm not into that guess who's closing on your position it's not satisfying for me at all [Music] a 20 million youtuber entered your stream jelly i've heard of jelly hey sophie what's up double xp games janice what's the secret buff on the ffa our film they changed a couple of the barrels they improved

there's a vehicle over here oh sweet we can drive away we're good i'm starting to get to get the hang of this uh 3x peli do you like it though cam would you pick it over like a car 98 or spr i personally don't really like the car 98 so i'm more inclined to use it anyway but if if you're not a confident sniper then i would say just avoid it jailbreak oh god awesome let's quickly get it and then let's get in the car and just drive away because you know what's gonna happen they're just gonna come straight they just got out of the uh bye hold on i can't see it ready jack yep [Music] we run

you're going up and down lucky i've learned sometimes if i push with you i get better gameplay but what i'm thinking is actually rotate round them they're fighting over here we need purple basically like i'm not sure where from you'll find that it's uh train roof i think purple's the place to be this this audio is sponsored by andre he's sponsored by train station roof down to one on the roof move now i kind of feel like if i had an hdr here i'll just be hitting the shots that i'm missing with the car not yet yeah but it's velocity versus a one-dimensional marksman rifle really oh i got hit closer yep that's fire station you're in the right spot get inside get inside holy crap there's a whole team coming oh yeah in here so by the way sng as well okay no i can't beat that hold your

to know if it's going to bounce strain or bounce buildings yeah yeah sure let's do that someone's just rezzed over here on blue moving here now so we should be ready for a cut scene should we now say a cut scene well single every other red dead redemption 2 mission because they ran out of ideas all right now we're going to ambush a train okay we're gonna ambush the train again isn't that just generally what cowboys did i think red dead one was more original oh they just raised here oh god there's a full team yeah there is a video we're here [Music] [Applause] [Music] splat right one more

jack playlist here oh he's got the single dma one more where is he we're still alive there's thought yeah yeah oh my god my guy screamed at me i can't kill him he was not happy well that was great apparently that single dear mati is uh very good by the way you know they know if the dual diameters the single one is really good feel free to give them that as well so you're going to see a lot more people using that as an smg kind of build get yourself sorted you're up there hey jordan thank you man listen up spl with norah is the best yeah it's pretty good front line but if you lose you're done you're up soldier now go sort this [Music] [Applause] thank you a couple satchees of mono let's just grab that cash really shouldn't i oh gosh this has been full looted here yeah i'm gonna go for a uav and maybe some self rises after this at least we know where the final zones are going to be do you know that that person was in like the budget fortnite skin um they literally ran me around like four times like i was trying to find them on the heartbeat yeah this has all been looted and used over here guys we can come to the bye but there's not much else left what's the budget fortnite skin part of interest okay i'm gonna do what what's the budget fortnite skin oh it's like the the the asian lady who's got like the the black ski mask and then the blue trousers oh yeah i know what you mean yeah domino something like that i don't know it just looks like a budget four nights ago again 63. what year is it should we head towards train yeah let me just see where this flag goes what's up frederick hey catch you reloading when's the new battlefield supposed to come out i guess october november this year they've said it's coming out this year so usually they're releasing october november end of october november i guess shifting location are we going over there no one around is there no buy station located it's we take train route for we've won basically mm-hmm yeah get some claims you want to take it this early this time or not well the thing is is the zones will collapse on it anyway so if we take the middle bastion be good cancel that full park it would be fun please let me get the xp uh yay wants money i got enough to buy on the buy station here i'm gonna go to the one that's over at uh train get close to it because then we can get straight up the straight up the stairs on the roof camp it like mf's just got a free air strike lovely oh lovely never turn down one of those salad in a pasta salad in the pasty [Laughter] have you got kilimanji is that good no i haven't got that we need that uh dropping my money we can get maybe a uav or something i don't think our meme deck will be complete without a killer mission you can connect a stream deck to the go xlr and then turn all the buttons into um harmful buttons well i know what i'm doing this evening you can actually feel like the g forces in change when you go from a max n to a car 98 this is like i don't think there's g-forces in this game but you just you just feel you just feel so much more like oh i can take any fight but every other gun is like yeah well i might as well hide in the corner and hope for the best yes your best fun doesn't it use any of the modern warfare ars versus the cold war ars and you'll realize how slow they make you run but surely that's got to be fixed right um at that point you're just disadvantaging an entire generation of weapons in the game people who don't have one wolf if the rumors are true about 1950s cod 2021 we'll have even worse weapons what rumors have you heard cameron about 1950s okay so it was only on modern warsaw in the twitter account last night yeah and he and he said that the next cod game is being developed by sledgehammer games and that it's set in the 1950s i mean that's that's a um that's a hard line if i ever heard one yeah so i mean a polarizing title a couple of people love it everyone else would would it be a continuation of world war ii as if like it carried on going or would it be fictional or what well 1950s is the korean one korean player here korea i'm pretty sure that's the war the americans avoid talking about there's two of them there on that loadout the hell he just disappeared i can't even see them because that trick you know hell he just disappeared like after that did he just didn't get blown up it just literally disappeared he spawned maybe somebody left it there too long to be fair there's been um a couple easter eggie memes around the maps that just feels like a bug right yeah it's probably a bug but ghost telly would be a fun easter egg um have you seen the lightning on the um on the warzone rumble maps do you mean the foreshadowing weather because they couldn't think of anything else creepy creepy thunder there's a we best be ready uh i don't know much about the korean war what happened um well they don't they don't really talk about it because they sort of showed up made everything dramatically worse and then left wasn't it just the russians backing the north and nato backing the south yeah but it was more sort of like a um a pp measuring contest that basically ended up ruining korea and it was just a proxy cold war fight basically yeah it's kind of like vietnam they just don't want to talk about it in fact i'm pretty sure there was something for a while that like people had gotten medals from the wall but like allowed to publicly show them or anything i mean oh players yeah those are the players that we shot already um i mean jack was saying the continuation of world war ii i wouldn't be opposed to that i mean did you ever watch man in the high castle no no i never saw it oh it's quite interesting like about the if the nazis won world war ii and what would happen to the world um it's kind of been done along before though [Music] it has but don't forget like it's not that's not like um something that most people would immediately click onto and be like oh yeah alternate reality world war two they'd be like oh no that was battlefield five the thing is though the weaponry isn't dramatically different either so it's gonna be quite but they're kind of limiting themselves quite a lot well maybe that would explain why it's being made in such a short period of time they're on twins by the way another cod to forget about is a good thing for battlefield 6 if they nail it well that's what i was saying to jack earlier when i was talking about that tweet underneath the tweet from modern war zone there were so many people saying this isn't it uh i can't wait for battlefield 6. i mean the fact that it's already been made by sledgehammer is like a 80 chance you'll probably want to skip anyway world war ii actually sold loads like it was a very successful game in terms of revenue do you know why though because it was the first game jumping piece of poop yeah about three years everybody thought it was gonna be a world of war but it was awful it was nowhere near waldorf and him again on that roof i think you can only play the nostalgia card once though you know yeah yeah yeah 100 which is why bf5 didn't work it would have worked if they went for an authentic world war ii game yeah oh yeah you know where we look like we were running around in blooming children's play acting hi i'm here in stalingrad no not the russian one some random norwegian one that we just thought of oh play another person's rest 147 isn't it he's going for the loadout on the roof they're on the roof here how do i miss every single shot on the roof but then when they parachute down i get one hey it's a hang time isn't it just predict it better one should we get a munitions box i think we should yeah yeah i'm running out yeah i'm running out right somebody nick starts cash [Music] yeah all of it i want to buy seven munitions boxes uh looking from twins again yeah it's bad to say i'm pretty sure you got shot from twins safe zone located no point really downing on those though i recommend doing the munitions box up here westy yeah i'll bring it out or the uk part of the korean war or is it just us russia korea mostly america we we um provided logistical support and really publicly supported yeah yeah books books yep bandages here are some books on war for you i mean the korean war would offer really interesting theaters of war why what kind of combat yeah basically i mean it's kind of like you know how you know the pacific is really interesting about vietnam and this is like yeah but it's just it's just jungle and hill isn't it are you coming again bro full team in those yeah nice i'm just saying i need to get in a fight pushing up jack just behind you out here two of them two of them on the body three one on the wall on the

way we're becoming iron well four kill win four kill wins or order of the day let's see you do this during uh peak hours ruined constantly because everyone's doing it because i guess you don't know if like how many other teams have gone like far north of you on the map and done like four or five recons and done exactly the same now well played there you go that's uh this cod boys honestly i love hearing people burn maybe i'm the bad guy i don't know no i don't think you are uh i'm just gonna try and find him on my list i don't even know what his name was no no no i'm gonna block him because

alright last game for me boys three in a row three in a row let's do it there were three in the park three in the pog and the little one said pog over i found a peli that i don't actually mind using i

if you want easier lobbies just play earlier in the day that's it it got buffed the um funks the barrels got buffed a couple of the barrels i changed it at the start of the uh stream at the start of the video check it out regalia unfortunately in these type of lobbies like that's how you you have to play you have to play to win like you can't you can just run around and do like bounties and uavs and everything but yeah it's too risky there's always going to be a couple of good squads i don't know much about it but i do know that the ground fighting from the battle of hoth was based on a concept experience in the korean war what so half from empire strikes back is that what you're saying um dead meat i've not really unlocked most of the attachments for the qbz so [Music] it wouldn't

if it's going to be the fire station red finish okay and we can go to the buildings to the south but there's three cars there already so it's safe to say those have already been taken right i'm across the road i hate this area there's someone on red now look you can see the marker danger loose yeah yeah they're all fighting they're just running in the bottom of red they're trying to take control of that building yeah but with green buildings the one i'm talking about just so you guys know oh you would okay sorry i've run to the wrong way we need it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's worth the game sweaty game ginger cry change great sweaty game sweaty game the tactical foresight moving on [Applause] [Music] uh he's gonna rest yeah come on pete right side goodbye an airstrike i think it's
