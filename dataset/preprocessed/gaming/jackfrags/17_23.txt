we just got our first look at gameplay of star field this is a brand new game from bethesda the makers of fallout and elder scrolls and it was announced in 2018 so it's been a long time coming but there's a lot of hype for this one and it's said to be an epic role-playing game where you get to be who you want and go where you want of course as you can see exploring in space but that's to claim that this is their most ambitious game ever and it's on their brand new creation engine 2 which will power this and of course the next elder scrolls 6. so i'm going to break everything down here we're going to talk about everything that we saw in the gameplay what it will offer without wasting any of your time so the gameplay starts off with the player arriving on a moon of crete it begins in a first person perspective and we can see in front of the player some kind of robot companion who ends up speaking to you we can also see on the heads-up display here we've got frags we've got oxygen levels co2 levels and some kind of pistol in the bottom right there and the player begins to explore the planet scanning around for the local fauna and wildlife we then see the players switch to third person so yep this can be played in first and third person and then they come across some aliens and it appears that to begin with they do consider opening fire but not all alien creatures in this game will be hostile on contact others maybe not as we'll see later in the gameplay but these ones seem pretty chill we then see the player mining some iron so there is a mining mechanic in this game and we'll go into that a little bit more later on in the video and also on that heads-up display we saw a photo mode i know a lot of people care about that kind of thing so the player goes ahead to discover a location and gain some xp from that and we find out that pirates are using this facility so it's time to get your guns out on the radio menu that comes up we can see four choices of weapons in the demo the player then moves into the facility graphics looking real good here some nice dynamic lighting it would seem definitely a big improvement on the last fallout game and then there's some basic combat here switching to various different weapons with some kind of p90 like smg doesn't look like there's any vats mechanic as we see in fallout so maybe all of the combat in this game is in real time some physics operating here as well and then the player continues on and they get to an area with a little hacking mini game if you played any of the elder scrolls games or fallout games you'll know that looting lock picking hacking in this circumstance is a regular feature and this is called a digipick and eventually the player opens it up and loops a new weapon called the equinox which kind of looks like a laser assault rifle the player then heads back outside and enemy pirates land their ship and begin to attack nice little skirmish goes on here and we get to see demonstrations of jump packs explosions and i'm imagining that this is all a scripted event in this particular story mission and then it skips forward and we find out that the player is invited to join constellation or the last group of space explorers and we head to a place called new atlantis we fly the ship there we land it and this is a location where we can see npcs walking around it's some kind of a hub i suppose you would say plenty of detail in the environments here and we go into an interior location where we can talk to characters i assume that these will give you main quests and side quests and these guys are committed to the question of what's out there and we're told that artifacts are the key to all of this there's some special artifacts that have been discovered and i guess that this is the main quest in the game to find out what these artifacts are what they're building and solve the main puzzle there so the players then set off on their way to find more of these artifacts scattered around the galaxy but the galaxy of course is full of many different groups with other priorities and it's up to you to choose what to do who do you want to ally with who do you want to work with do you want to take down pirates or perhaps join them maybe you'll join the peacekeepers maybe you'll just be a big alien bounty hunting guy who goes and fights creatures so it's obvious that there's many biomes and locations to explore here and they did talk about that a bit later on so your actions in this game with this being a bethesda title it's an rpg your choices have consequences and we're on to the character creator here todd howard said that this is the most flexible one they've ever built yet and you can customize all of the elements of how you look even the way that you walk you can also pick a background that will give you three starting skills and characters in the game will interact with you based on what you picked there are optional traits too with disadvantages and advantages if you want to really get into the metagame the nitty gritty the skill system of course we've got that here too and that combines the best of their previous games they say we saw skill trees like tactical ballistics science and you can level these up by using them and completing challenges the game has crafting as well and this could be simple science projects with the resources that you find for upgrades for example or you can use this to craft weapon mods you can also build your own outposts and bases and these can be for survival and resource generation i didn't play much fallout 76 but i know that that had some form of base building in it it looks like they've taken some of that maybe and implanted that here and you can choose where and how to build each one and then you can hire characters to keep them up and running which is quite interesting so it seems like there's some kind of upkeep meta game with these places that you build you can also build your own spaceships too this was pretty cool you can change the look of the interior the exterior you can choose crew members and todd said that the look and layout of these can be completely customized with lots of different ship modules and ship manufacturers to choose from you could see the different parts here kind of being chosen in a list and then snapping onto different areas and yes you can fly that ship too and how you build it also affect how it performs so that could be from the engines to the shields to the weapon systems you want to build something that's tanky or something that's more like a glass cannon and then it showed taking off into space to demonstrate some space combat but i want to say that it didn't show taking off from the ground as a player and then going into space so that could have been a cutscene so maybe temper your expectations for this one i'm not sure they're gonna have the whole complete control of flying from space down onto a planet and leaving a planet and flying up into space all player controlled it might just be that was a cutscene because they didn't really show that i feel like if that was a thing in the game a playable mechanic they would have demonstrated it but no confirmation of that so far but we've definitely got flying around in space here with space combat you can do first person third person cool looking dashboard there and we had options like target lock the boost the speed the balance of the weapon systems the lasers the missiles so it seems like there's a bit of depth in the space combat i don't think it's going to be quite star citizen levels of complicated for flying these ships not that it has to be but i would expect a more accessible arcade version of that with a few systems to manage we also got to see ships flying through asteroid fields and bigger ones that kind of look like cargo freighters you could also dock with other ships that was demonstrated for a second too so how big is this game well todd said that you can explore anywhere on the planet so maybe this is truly open world in that respect but not just on one planet in fact all the planets in the system so there might be planets in this particular system that are barren and resource heavy ice balls to goldilocks like planets with a lot of life and creatures and then i was kind of surprised by this todd said that there were over 100 systems with over 1 000 planets to explore not sure how they're going to pull that one off i'm assuming there's going to be a lot of copy paste in there with the main story beats as the more detailed stuff but i'd love to see how this turns out and that was it really overall looks good seems interesting it's been in the works since before 2018. so obviously a lot of time and effort has gone into this the music was really good too i don't know who composed it but awesome music in the trailers and they said that this is coming out in 2023 and it will be on xbox game past day one at the start of the show though they did say that every game in the show was coming out within the next 12 months so summer next year maybe for starfield unless it gets delayed which i'm guessing it might do also just a bit of a preference for me i kind of wish that this had co-op or some form of multiplayer so i could play through the story and enjoy exploring and building stuff together making ships together with a friend anyways there we go that's our first look at starfield gameplay do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below how you feeling about this one if you enjoyed the
