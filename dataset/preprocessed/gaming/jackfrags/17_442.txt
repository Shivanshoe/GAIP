with how bad cheating is in cod warzone at the moment we were getting quite sick of it and with a bit of experimentation myself and study found a way to guarantee that you don't play with those horrible blatant aimbot ball hacking players on pc and we tested this on xbox and playstation at the moment it only works 100 on playstation 4 or 5. first you've got to go to options and then to account settings and change cross play from enabled to disabled now when you search for a game a message will come up saying would you like to turn crossplay on just select no and the game will start searching for a lobby anyway leave it to search and it might pop up another message saying the same thing if it does just press no again and eventually it will put you in a game full of only playstation players great success like i said this doesn't work on xbox at the moment sadly from what i tested at least but if you do have a playstation console this method will guarantee avoiding pc cheaters and so we decided to play a few matches on ps5 and see what it's like it's surprisingly a really different experience than on pc with crossplay enabled way more chill and it's nice to know that everyone that you come up against is legit my playstation account is quite low level too so i just had a basic kilo build not really worth showing what it was anyways i hope you enjoyed this guys if you do leave a like thank you and as always cheers to everyone using my cod supporter creator code in the store with that said i think you'll enjoy this let's get it i don't know jack but it might be three i'll probably hear you i'm running in i've got daddy okay our teammate seems nice okay as well like he's suspicious i might die but i want it i know we're here we're here we're here okay they are not here one meter and him that one finished that's it all right that's the team that's the team that's how we do it that was rose skins too again energy i'm unlocking things for cod zombies what that's so weird what yeah it's cause it's got cross progression wow that's very strange but we have grass progression on pc that makes no sense yeah but because i've already got past those basic levels i never saw that stuff you know what i mean i see oh we both did it at the same time yeah we did there he is contact broke get him check get him you got it yeah it's basically we all play on low settings because you get more frame rate you get easier visibility whereas on ps5 it's on much higher settings by default when everyone's on the same so it doesn't really matter might as well i kind of forgot that it is a nice looking game like it's yeah it's actually really no it's actually really nice it's one of the it's one of like the top yeah most difficult thing for me though is the fov like it's just well it feels like i'm fighting in a tunnel yeah i think i'm just a little tunnel vision very strange let's take a mac 10. he spotted people tuning in yeah i feel so slow i feel like i'm running in sludge oh it's so hard to aim he's not he's absolutely in there jack he's like fully in there yeah the gas is coming though i see him at the back there at the back yeah it's on there he's kind of ruined no no they're ruined they're ruined because they're gonna have to run towards us don't they but he's also kind of running into them so yeah like oh there i've just seen one run through here okay we need to move [Applause] you know what i do like about this about playing on console with crossbow relaxed you well it's a bit more relaxed but also you don't question the kills let's say we don't want to push too far because we'll be stuck there's someone in that building as well yeah we are kind of stuck now aren't we should we go back yeah let's move let's move back let's do that yeah i don't think we should go around this yeah that's a bad fight to take he's going for it though bloody [Applause] we're running away he's like yeah let's go baby it just rest there yeah yeah i mean at least we're here now so we're on the right side yeah this isn't a bad position i'm not i'm not a big fan of what we're doing yeah this isn't ideal this is danger zone and we also have a guy who's ghosted maybe a team behind us if one yellow oh god this is we're gonna have to fight in the gas i don't want too scared he's gonna be here jack he's gonna be here oh god i put an airstrike on it [Applause] there's more there's more there's more [Applause] jack there's one more to the right somewhere where there is one more to the right somewhere bouncy bouncy i don't see him though yeah no no he will be there beams down okay oh my god he can't deal with these moves down oh no he can stop please i'm gonna self-reside and hopefully maybe survive the gas the gas um go left i guess yeah no no you have to go right you have to go right right i'll go oh no are we dead we survived where we been from the second you come up against the team using like rose skins of the kilo you just die instantly it's not just the experience well yeah they're good control players aren't they [Music] oh he's been he's he's marking people they're running up behind us jack i don't have an angle they're they're going to be right in front of you there on that hill what is this scope team one he's gonna be in the house they have to move though they have to move on down i'm dead i've got the right right dead nice nice nice dead we might get pushed in the back so dude have they got they've got weapons they've got gas masks lovely i'm taking this guy's car not here oh it's a it's an awful ending jack it's an absolutely terrible ending and i'd is it yeah it's probably the worst ending we could ever have hoped for there's a guy on that shed there it is kind of an awful ending yeah we're gonna have to go through the houses we're gonna have to go left side and then just hope we don't meet people in the houses yeah moving i picked up this guy's m13 he's got the iron sight on i hate the iron sight n30 i mean the ray of survival is very low i would say are you kid i literally just spammed space bar okay you don't get frisbee i just slam the space run it wouldn't use my parachute oh you didn't get down nope i see him over there stodd i see him over there you could probably hear me stand my face trying to take him out we have to move yeah we gotta go yeah they're watching us the snipers on the from the shed right side or right side yeah right there god yeah this is going to be very interesting hey this is about him there was a guy behind as if yeah he's about to you have to move now they're on they're on the shed they're on the shed they're on the chest isn't there someone up here yeah there in our teammates poggin this one is the one on blue okay um no no he's dead he's dead now didn't get team wipe though there's definitely people on their side on the side on the side oh god they're being pushed yeah we're gonna watch that guy to the left there's still one there yeah maybe push top push top of the hill if you can get it there i'll go first i haven't peaked yet i'm not i'm looking i'm trying to see if he's peeking left side left side of the shed nice i think there's more than one there could be that could be the solo though he's not peeking jack oh we can't go to the shed come on we have to we have to i'll move in a little bit hang on i can maybe get sniped on him if i i'm just making sure i'm not gonna get shot in the back by the third team or whatever you pete speak the window there's there's definitely three on the track being the track it's kind of kind of neat i'm a break i'm a hit broke broke broke two broke two broken edge one down two down let's see nice nice nice three two three yeah i'm going around this side got one finished one full bang oh god oh pizza get in there stop get in there down down down down down nice nice 3v1 i'm covering where's the last guy down the hill maybe east i just saw him maybe i think i just throw him here maybe maybe not sure i'm healing i've got 34 bullets you want some ammo i'm okay i can grab something here i think yeah got some in there is that him that's in there here i just smashed him nice that's how you avoid cheaters on card warzone we did it playing console turn crossplay off it's a completely different game i mean that was fun though like but the pacing is completely it was fun completely different that you can run in the open and not get instantly killed it's crazy but i think i think avoiding the close range fights actually works in your favor yeah literally just making sure you stay medium medium long range you get aim assisted if you uh take the close range fights with the mac 10s and the mp5s that's exactly what we wanted we had a good team out there as well oh the teammate absolutely i just oh god djs and i'm i can still do it i go i'm simply blown away there it is [Music] you
