right here gonna lead us through the zombie apocalypse today uh okay campaign all right what what difficulty do we want to do we've got recruit veteran i think we're all seasoned fps players yeah i i feel like veterans the way forward to start with yeah yeah let's try veteran then throw it back to five minutes later um i think we should all go back to uh recruit i think yeah yeah the last time i tried this on the veteran it was actually really difficult oh really but who knows we might just be so good at the game that it will be easy i'm optimistic jack jack optimism is the way forward here it's got friendly fire doesn't it veteran i think what dude it's got friendly fire oh no oh yeah yeah i could not shoot me your mom no you've just reminded me that doctor who thing you might know you my mommy that was so creepy no that might be creepier than the zombies that's horrifying that's that's my guy i'm that guy at the reload speed he's the one i want to be i want to be the guy that has melee weapons because that's always fun it's good to see you chris mom it's not mum like behavior though rude long time no see sorry i was beginning to think you weren't coming picking character uh i'm going to evangelo you need to put aside your difference with phillips yeah i'm done playing soldiers for him you should be too come on chris i don't think we've seen this don't tell me you're scared for his bs especially after what happened to jason don't bring my son into this look you know how i feel about phillips but he's right there outside this is a war the generals just cling into the glory days there's no chief left to hail to not that i'd want to look i get it no you don't okay we're surviving here rebuilding survival is not enough we've got to fight now we don't need to do anything all right when was the last time you saw written in any numbers hmm [Applause] i got outside [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's pretty brutal it's quite violent that's a big one [Music] i don't like mondays no [ __ ] not at all not the worst hey i got this there's another big [Applause] boom oh mom's a badass our character's just called mom by the way it's fine i'll come to the team yeah it's brand new that is i've not seen that in the beta act one resurgence it's shooting the mind how bad is it how bad is it going to be to shoot the crows i just want you why you do realize you've never said anything i wouldn't have shot the crows and now i'm like oh jackson jackson oh you guys have started i was watching the cutscene no i was doing that these guys just skipped and i'm like oh i guess i'll skip them see jack you've got shorty so normally shorties go first they're always the uh they disperse the crowd okay do you want to go i've got an assault rifle i don't know how all right you want the reload speed yeah reload speeds oh oh there's guns there's guns extra guns do i should i go shopping well there's a shop as well you can buy an ak lying here i'm gonna go with the ak i've got to show you i've only got 15 bullets in this okay oh it's a disaster i think you've got to buy a uh extended ammo extended clip at some point later i'll stick with the ak and then we'll we'll work with it okay all right we're ready to do this i'll take point yes oh wow that's the special infected already okay no chill yeah to be honest i'm with you on that caesar salad dressing you can't beat caesar salad especially in the zombies i'm i'm punching the door right it's not unusual to watch a man punch your door down isn't it have you met benny central i don't know yeah he has done that angry whenever there's a a closed door you just know there's going to be something waiting i can hear something horrible oh that guy's got um you open this one you can't open that one just punch it trust me when in doubt just punch it if any i'm punching it nothing's happening nothing's happening oh there's quite a few there yeah i ran out of ammo at the wrong moment there you go oh this one oh look there's some punch this one as well oh no if you punch the door in the zombies on the other side i mean this shotgun's got a fair bit of range on it surprising really oh yeah you can see you could stay back in that window and just continuously shoot on the roof that's crazy i found a crate there's some crates here as well guys oh yeah let's see what's going on oh whoa i've just been i've been spat on oh it's in that little window he lives there oh no what is that oh my god i've just lost like half my health from all that is anyone's name let me heal you this will call her i healed myself right i'm not paranoid about these windows and big guys that we're like these really good if you get overwhelmed you can push them back with the melee ah okay that's a nice refiner oh my god i'm a machete okay yeah that took us quite a lot of health there yeah i'm oh my god it's like a big arm dude but you can't get away right like in little medical crates we're gonna have to kill this lad oh my lord hill john with pain meds where are you all right hey john i've got some pain meds for you thank you you've got i mean we're all covered in blood right now i don't want to talk about it about it john i want to put it on youtube i'm telling you this veteran difficulty was a uh a great great decision yeah i can't see how this could go wrong oh special specimen container what's that this is my grateful face has anyone got any ar drop that mine in the same way flip left take it all better look like you need this wait how do i do that oh just dropped it for you thank you thank you very much i'll put it to good use it what what the bullets in the zombies brains benny put the bullets in the zombies brains that's all you got to do all right i've got you oh there's loads of ammo in here and there's um john there's health i'm not even going to grab it because i don't want to risk it oh thank you it's a big one oh god big guy i think everyone can use it but you've got a pain there's one free use and then you've got to pay to uh again i wanted all i want to know is why these how are these big guys getting through these corridors that's that's all i want to know okay they're very flexible benny that's it that's all it is remember what i said at the start about the crows like they are stick to the top if you can try not to drop down [ __ ] oh damn that grenade went quite well just be so careful there's any zombies in front of us that are like in the same direction as the crows because you might shoot kill the zombie and then actually shoot the crows what happened birds can alert the horde yeah oh oh oh um and that's the perfect demonstration and here is one of the new gameplay features oh my goodness i should have probably warned about where i was throwing that sorry jack that's all right oh my god there's a there's two big guys all right that was a great squad oh my god i fell off because i got hit oh sorry jack we've got to get the big guys they're like the main thing i've got is my melee weapon now i'm out of ammo what ammo do you know john uh ar if you've got any oh no uh i have a horrible feeling that's me oh i'm nearly down oh my god wow oh no i'll continue that was i'll continue it's fine okay all right we're good i feel like they've made it more difficult compared to the beta i remember the veteran difficulty was so like the easy difficulty and then this there was such a drastic jump that i thought they would have changed this to not be so difficult but i think it's still just as hard interesting it seems to me like there's way more special infected of the crowd yeah so yeah and leo perfectly demonstrated the chrome mechanic which we all wanted to see again i reckon if that never happened we might have made it i just have a little hunch oh yeah we'll go all the way it takes us all the way back to the yeah yeah oh that's brutal at least we know what we're doing now okay okay so what we're doing yeah speed for it do you have a melee if you don't know what's over there like our time um yeah you can pick a melee off as your second right so you don't have just the melee as well now we know now we know yeah i'm taking i've taken that baseball bat so how do you heal other people then if i have some healing pills i accidentally healed myself instead of i think you just got to be very careful you just can't be uh moving ready i'm ready it's made me a bit more conscious about my health pile yeah especially on this mode you know benny you called me out for friendly fire but you have killed so many people that i've seen um it's because i'm shooting and then people run in front of me i'm like what do i do stop shooting because everyone else is yeah maybe save it until someone really needs need to heal i've got some copper what's it ak i got 500 copper real ball it spend on upgrades put some crates here by yourself again oh my god i'm don't run through that that is bad all right everyone don't have no fear i've got a lot of bullets oh yeah remember there was crate stuff on this roof oh this guy's interesting to fire remember the guys came from the roof didn't they so we could have the propane tank yeah we can use that defensive propane nice looking onion rings there i mean i'd go for this all right hold on wait i'm just setting up the trap the horse do you sound like they're having a good time down there where do you want to go join them yeah they're just vibing yeah maybe yeah maybe we should just jump off and join them no maybe not it's a long way down to the lmg i think you've got to shoot his shoulder [Music] there is a lot of zombies coming through on that bridge yeah benny where's that propane tank when you need it you really despise that character that jumps around yeah hold on all right let me try and heal you so that wasn't so bad wait wait jump i'm bringing this propane attack with me everywhere it's benny's lovable imagine if you beat the whole game just holding a propane tank that'd be very impressive enough for me i'm very oh come on i'm very sorry i'm just hitting is that you no one has one right now oh my god i've i've moved i've moved on in the world don't worry guys i've got a whole thing of gasoline okay be careful with that oh now it's crows then do not shoot the crows yeah [Applause] we might have to go on the ground [Music] you know god damn it i don't like the idea of going on the ground you did we've not got any choice oh whoa this is like this weird guy a small little guy he's just oh my gosh i'm hanging on that big guy i should probably do that it's a big guy again he's coming up watch out i've fallen down it's actually really tough i can't believe there's another difficulty i think maybe once you've tacticed out a little bit i can hear a big one over there i'm running back having one guy on the floor defeating people is actually not a bad idea so where i've got the big guy i have no fear you killed him better i'm i'm nearly going i'm almost down oh i'm nearly dead though i can't take much more i've killed the big guy i've killed him yeah you you killed him oh thank you jack i uh leah you did all the work with her come on get up to give her that job if i can do it it's fine i've not got any that shoots acid i'm just running i've got no stamina oh of course i see the safe house what speeder destroyed what do you mean hp in a dream oh god we are so good oh my goodness great work [Applause] for that he just stopped to death in the same room i don't know i'll just never leave oh a big adds just come in with a two pounds well saying right trigger heals you left trigger heals others wow very nice attack every wow i just tried supply points earned yeah spend some of these yeah we don't have any more continues if we game over that's it 30. 800 copper yes we must be able to spend this on some stuff yeah i think we can like buy uh weapon upgrades like attachments and stuff yeah you can choose another card as well i think so each round you get another card or yeah yeah oh god i remember there's like a massive boss that spawns when we get to these tunnels oh don't say that you can just run past it it's fine yeah corruption cards the birds oh no yeah okay so it's made the birds even more open i think so no great complete the level of all four cleaners still alive to earn an extra 10 supply that's yeah we can do that the tip is aim for the head to put them down quickly thank you by doing that really good tip it was a good tip i might actually go for the knife i don't know a healing efficiency straight away i wonder if there's a card that heals you as you melee and get kills there might be life steal or something yeah something like that oh well yeah i had one where if i was at critical health i got heals for every kill i got which saved me at the end yeah that's a really wow that's really really good you guys see this guy in the corner hey come with us no one will friendly fire you or anything yeah no no no one shoots each other here look at our health by the way i just realized it's gonna be um it's gotta be some health in here for us surely yeah that's rough all right here we go yeah meds men smith spencer meds payments yep i know you need you need bandages that's what we need or med kits oh yes that's only temporary health oh god yeah jeez we'll probably find one soon i think oh no oh that's cool if you go to where refills is you can refill your actual just your health deal yeah all right cool you need to take care of this i'm fine but i should probably take care of this long road ahead better stock up you also get ammo as well i don't know what i did but i think i wasted money so i need to punch myself up oh oh i see you can only hold a bandage or a first aid kit well there's a bandage on the floor if someone wants it if anyone can pick it up i'm still not i'm already carrying a first aid perfect gotta take care of this i don't like that sound does anyone um i've spent all my cash okay all right are we ready oh god we open the door all right yeah good spot all right [ __ ] be careful i want to get on well there is a molotov over there back away oh that [ __ ] would be useful i've got frank though i've got a frag i've got a frag so if someone wants that molotov i don't want to go anywhere near those birds to be fair now based on the knowledge that we know there's a giant monstrum right in front of us do you want to run past it or do you want to try and take it off can you run past it you can you can run past it yeah i like the sound of that i'm actually quite enjoying the melody he yes well now i guess we should use that reloading nice watch out there's a ton of zombies as well yeah they all just spawn true is bella oh my god he's gone i would advise the running pass method yeah yeah i like the sound of that i am joining you on that run it's a pretty big isn't it if you come down this corridor there should be a little hole in there oh no but you just got destroyed come get me oh no someone i mean it will come down here we can save benny though if he dies we can get him later on yeah we remember we lose the mission we lose the benefit so remember the challenges all four cleaners oh no i [Music] [Music] that's your bargaining chip isn't it yeah that's why i have it outside just remember oh my god what the hell i've got bad news i'm grappled by something there's a big guy behind julia cena i think i've got the quick friends yeah there you go right all right now let's go let's go do this try and get pass you know we've nearly got this thing down he just comes back though it's not even a heart health he's got more than half [Music] of you guys [Music] is it coming in here i don't know i think it's fine it's fine um yes may i have it please there you go thank you you've tricked an alarm top of me yeah that didn't go as bad as i thought oh another one of those things you should use again oh no big guy focusing behind us behind us you're being squeezed benny he's squeezing me like an orange melee teammates i didn't mean to he was being squeezed i don't want to be squeezed it doesn't matter uh [Music] terry crews on these guys oh my god it might be another one in there guy i think there's another usage there or you can spend 400 copper if you want why is my shotgun got a sniper scope i'm sorry where did he come from what the i did not even see him from above oh god he must have done yeah if any of you guys have got 400 copper you can use that all right let's see i'm going to go down there i think you do in the venue in the when we get to the safe house oh there's tiny things that come out of the end of my gun right now it's fine we'll find some help in here look john you look great right now like right what i just opened the door oh no i triggered the door along really yes you didn't even need to open the door because this hole gets through here anyway oh no i did not even notice let me first i've got a shotgun i've got a shotgun i don't hey i mean look at these bodies here what the hell that's the power of the aaa shotgun right there delivering a swift and uh safe have you got any rifles sponsored by the aa shotgun and not hey swift painless death to all zombies a shotgun yes do you have any assault wife lamar i could still uh hold on let me check let me i've got two yeah this shotgun's amazing actually oh i'm gonna open up this crate i like this shotgun i think there's a big guy behind us oh there's a oh another lmg like that can we open oh watch out oh no no army lad i'm impressed with how we're doing we may be able to open this door with a toolkit yeah there could be stuff in here i am on it um okay almost down hp ammo that's cool what does that do i have no idea hollow points oh there's a health thing here oh yeah lovely thank you god we really are i don't have any help do we no can you afford that leah we like living on the edge ah no if i drop you that is that enough uh yeah so we can drop each of the copper as well i didn't realize that oh no then watch out benny when we go through this door we're going to see that uh big ogre boss again i've only got 24 health that's the one ah okay maybe you don't go first then oh no i i can heal you down here a little bit all right well you said give me a minute this is a lot of zombies outside here oh god oh there it is he's watching yours where's that shotgun [Music] oh my god i'm sure oh he's not betting he's got benny oh oh my god are you hitting me you got me he's coming for you he's coming for you with me yes yes i don't know if we can kill him at this point i think we're just trying to oh yeah i think he's just running past him is there an smg anywhere maybe pistol i don't want any fire fire there's a tank right in front of me one second okay okay now i think it's uh oh there's a tall boy behind me no no okay it's fine it's fine it's fine he's dead i've got defibrillator let me try it [Music] uh i'm nearly out obama as well i've been trapped oh no now this is really difficult yeah that difficulty is no joke no continues remaining holy cow yeah i think casual might be um are we casual gamers maybe we are we might be are we casual gamers oh continues around i think we can start back on that level though yeah that was tough oh stream thank you for tuning in appreciate you guys being here we've been live for about 35 minutes now i mean i definitely feel like they've increased the difficulty from the beta and the alpha it seems a lot more difficult but i don't i'm kind of worried that the if we go to the easier mode it might be a bit too easy because you know you like there to be a challenge don't you so we'll see i mean i i i'm liking the guns i feel like they've changed something with the guns and the gun play whether that's the sounds or something out they just feel a bit more satisfying uh thank you for the 20 as well [Music] ksc please don't hurt me i'm sure you're fully prepped before heading out uh no this is the veteran level please don't hurt me is that doom doom isn't it what's up hero a team ninja tai docs as bjorn what's up hey alex i'm very good thank you 24 hour joker performance is really good as well like i definitely feel like i'm getting way more fps and then the beta well we can spend supply points i don't know what they do but it sounds like a good idea is it for your cards yes want to unlock cards or cosmetics you need to earn supply points yes vitamins come on pouch heavy attack oh i've got a heavy attack yeah nice and zombie's head is flying off there you can burst forward with a melee attack without benny that sounds like a bit of me to be honest it sounds like it was made for benny i only shot them a couple of times it was with a shotgun but hey all right what can i send spend these points on supply points oh there's more paul's alley which one which one oh i want to go pools alley i love the idea of vitamins like that might help you in this situation zombie apocalypse vitamins don't worry i just need more vitamin d yeah yeah vitamin b runes get some zinc magnesium oh you can upgrade your weapons here as well just so you uh if you haven't thought about it okay i'm just unlocking a load of like cards uh yeah i think you can create your own deck as well if you wanted to but i literally only got other skins their skins their skins also as you play more of the game you're about to unlock all of these all 24 cards that's cool and purchase upgrades from the supply lines so you might as well put them all on at the moment you can take 15 it looks like oh yeah so we get all of them don't we yeah you can just put them on and you rename the deck memes oh wait oh i've not been putting them on oh that might help you should have had a starter deck for the first year so i've got 10. i've got 10. so that sounds about right i've got 11. right go okay i am ready whenever you are yep good to go campaign continue run that sounds good to me wait hang on why is it so can we lower the difficulty as well i hope so it's coming up saying craig rundle then tunnel of blood which is where we died at yeah crossed out friendly fire 35 is that naturally difficult this is going to be on recruit select starting point yeah we'll start back right there okay nice there we go it could be a a lot easier now oh he's going all right that's going fine just great absolutely fine why you sound so nervous i'm not afraid at all it's fine it's fine john vitamin defense that's it isn't it hey spartan no dice today i'm sorry yeah right yeah jose we'll be we'll be streaming the older campaign so tonight we're just doing an hour of campaign and then an hour of pvp but later on in this week i'll be continuing the campaign because i'm really looking forward to this what are we waiting for i'll be holly again pick the memes deck which i just built what's up charlene from south africa thank you hey richard what's up chl he'll see i like turtles too danny there's nothing wrong with a good turtle is there melee kills heal to health i'm gonna pick health and i mean you can't just you could just build like a melee build if you wanted to yeah i might run shotgun again we'll say just way more health no i just i think that's how much health we had last time i think it was just it all just sort of disappeared it's just depleted very quickly this wooden animal card is so good so useful oh oh wow look at that aim assist like hop what does it do from a go from like a crowd crazy i'll take the melee i know i've already got that it's now a good time to bring up the elephants i'll take the m4 i think melee weapons are pretty good to have so i'll hold up you've got cards that give your health back yeah uh i'm gonna get a oh i've got we've got a thousand uh points as well to spend in the shop let me try this uh okay ten points just so much confidence now yeah too much i completely forgot to spend any money in the shop at least you know for next time yeah i know you can go out i don't spend any should we try and take the ogre out everyone oh [Music] i mean in the trailer like there's a monster that's even bigger than this yeah you can cancel that attack you're right all right he's focusing on me i think oh no he's focusing [Music] he couldn't handle the smoke you know we nearly got him to half health last time as well we went down multiple times in this tunnel so is this the next level that pulls you down are we a couple levels down there uh yeah it's difficult there's there's only three i think there's something right and we're just like yeah we were middle before john right wow middle difficulty yeah we were struggling [Music] don't open any doors that are locked i've noted it's like we got bigger problems to worry about than just the written oh so what is razor wire you can set a trap or something yeah i can just lay it down there's some damages enemies across it oh all right i'm gonna pick that up with a defense maybe we should save that ah [Music] it's almost like you let someone burn their stamina and then someone else takes their place oh my god my biggest time for that razor wire did it here hey i defended benny central i appreciate it thank you i think at this part you just have to climb up on the cars to get past you don't actually have to fight oh the big ladder i like that advice i don't know i should probably have just followed that oh god he's doing that please get out of there i'm on my way i'll be running the bus it's gonna be a problem later on so let's just take him out while we can there we go hey let's go nice to meet you oh my god he's got faces on his face oh god oh honestly look at this pot is pulsating on his back lovely vile he's got a lot of big teeth as well bunda but no benny no no i could use that is disgusting never ever do that again i'm sorry they're a lot easier to kill on this difficulty yeah oh [Music] shelter safe house is just there i'm actually enjoying using a sniper on this i'm smiling oh it's defended i want an actual working lightsaber that's probably why i'm having so much health is because there's no friendly person yeah that makes sense hey we've done it complete the mission without any players being incapable or killed let's go nicely nice excellent wow sorry mommy it's quite calming music as well unlocked pain drain hey alex is squad up coming back yes i would say so what's up logan hello pastor uh there's a toichi beat thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you what's up dustin yeah i feel like we breezed through that it's quite a big difference isn't there between the casual difficulty and the normal difficulty but perhaps the normal difficulty once you learn the systems of the game and you start communicating a bit more and applying tactics maybe that becomes a bit easier and of course normal difficulty if you've accrued more cards then you would think you'll have a bigger advantage right playing even on that normal difficulty if your character is just stronger then you can survive more maybe you just have to play the game a bit more before you can get the hang of normal i can't imagine what the more difficult difficulties like more difficult difficulty is that i think there's a turtle there that's a snapping turtle isn't it take your hand off that will like the setup they've got in here you pizza boxes oh bit bit untidy though uh team quick item upgrade yeah george washington bridge we cannot wait for those caught on the other side of one out i've got a sniper [Music] pipe bomb oh i love that you can buy team ammo that's really cool let's buy ammo for everybody hmm [Music] oh you can buy your health back yeah yeah yeah at the start you don't have to buy like a health pack and then use that to heal yourself that's where we were going where's my gun that's what we were going wrong oh my god i've played it so like this was in the beta but i don't ever remember playing it with this much fog i picked up a ammo pouch as well nice team player look at that medic and better than i am i know support player i've never played everyone well that charge is cool yeah this fog is insane yeah this is mental i love the lighting as well when you see the the outside lights with the fog nice effect i actually you just made me look up to the moon i blinded myself there's a flashbang benny wow [Applause] in my defense i just got eaten into the crows i will forgive you on this occasion i definitely have glowing eyes it's very kind of them i don't know if anyone can hear me but our settlement is gone the infected have changed mutated i repeat evansburg is gone oh what's happened to jack oh it said that you were disconnected on the uh on the menu on the left for me i didn't see that as weird he's running around threateningly waving yeah who wants it uh big guy oh my god stop exploding in my face it looks like it doesn't do much damage it just really annoys me too much you just froze you halfway across the world that's what i'm looking for yeah actually i'm not gonna use the base zombies you don't actually want to use your ammo that's a very good point actually i did not think about that jump jump jump jump i'm gonna do some snipey snipes real quick all this fall damage oh my god again i've been intoxicated what's that oh 1v1 [Music] this fog is pretty impressive oh my god they just clinged on the clinging to the side of like buildings it's really horrible creepy it's reminding me that all kind of gears gears effects where you just can snap on to the person just like no just like press left trigger and it'll kind of like snap onto you are you playing with controlling yeah has anyone got a um toolkit um i don't think so damn it patching myself up we don't need it i need this it's just a suggestion is it propane tanker uh did you just activate that vinny yes okay oh i'm being grappled by something nice picture [Music] that's just called the horde straight away then i'll take this i think yeah [Music] fire involved if you walk in the dryer it will hurt you unfriendly fire yeah literally okay there's enough now we can jump over if you want to go i'm on it i'm on it save house here oh no oh god oh god oh no the sleeper got me oh oh no thank you i'll be safe from city right in front of us i think is it in hit yet through here oh oh no another one i just love you today must be the cologne all the blood yeah out of the park cool i've got a patch i'm so low on health um when we get in the safe house i will drop you something sorry i got oh this is getting manic oh no no no no no no no no no oh no no what was he doing there oh sit up down thank you very much i appreciate that the safe room we're all alive so going to count that as a win dub i think we're ready for cvp yeah i think it's pvp time i'm ready yeah very ready right now do you feel like you're an efficient fighting you know i think i think we i reckon they went and put went through the casual mode first of course so they've not gone through what we've gone through oh so you think they just went right for easy difficulty yeah i i reckon they went for easy difficulty you know just to warm up but we we we've bonded okay over right yeah we're veterans now we've bloodied we we've we've gone through things i love that we've gone through things it's been it's been a tough time but we've gone through it we've we've made it through the other side uh right so we're leaving the menu yeah leave game well let's see what do we do we go to trash talk are they finished one british way yeah i can't believe you said that initially do you do you want to would you like to participate in some trash talking you suck well i think are you back for blood some practice at this game gentlemen so we should be able to start a game and then send a code i think you're the leader again john okay so how do i invite benny and leah back yeah i'm going to join now autumn social excellent invite join there we go guys appendix almost burst the other day doc was on deployments how do we um without anesthesia there's like a there's like a custom code that we can use yeah i think you have to you have to make the lobby first and then we can share it with them and they can join yeah let's get host advantage let's make sure we're hosting yeah i like it i like it how am i not surprised look leah right i'm i'm not afraid of me i'm a i'm a competitive person right everyone has their bad days mate see i love how i'm saying it and john's the first one who goes in with a trash talk we're ready to take you down that's a very timid trash talk there yeah wow we're gonna beat you i hope you're afraid what's out here oh you can actually go oh there's a shooting range oh a bit of practice there right oh there's a barrett no scope oh there there's a machete there's not a sword oh machete same thing really right um did you fire the game up john did you go create a oh i have to go create it i was i have no idea how to create if you come here and then you press swarm and then create private server oh that's how you do it yeah and then we've got to show you there you go right yeah yeah or maybe we can just use weapons um i've got the private code i will paste it in for them now so that should put all four of us in the lobby i think i think for them they need to put that in and then it should join yeah i think that's really cool that you can do private private matches oh um a horrible recoil pattern if you just got searching at the bottom john yes they're searching oh no people in my chat saying they're going to join no no no please don't please no yeah we've got an intense battle of wills happening here we yeah this is the battle it's really sacred this is the battle of the year guys yeah many central versus jacksepticeye [Music] we've got all these different there's so many options just trying to figure out what's best to use what's the ranch rival there's quite a lot of damage drop back on the guns no there is yeah you can see the damage numbers yeah 22 and then the far one's 15.9 yeah that's quite a bit okay it says waiting for server now so we should oh here we go here we go yeah i think they can join now round one the pipe cleaners receive mutation points okay mommy oh yeah i'm ready which deck are we going for oh my god we've got 15 cards uh i'm gonna go for soldier i'm gonna go for operator one of the cards said vanguard so uh jack you are squad leader then no no no pressure whatever that means right when you stow your weapon it reloads oh that's pretty good hey that's pretty good [Music] um no no this isn't the pvp mode this is a swarm mode oh oh i thought that's what the pvp mode was called that's what i thought because when you said swarm are we in the wrong mode yeah i think we are oh no maybe not because people are there's someone on the opposite team but that's not one of the guys that we're supposed to be playing against oh dear can you kick people john do you have that control um there's one person on enemy team just called i moving target can you click on this one that's right that's right is that one of the guys okay i think so yeah i'll double check but i'm pretty sure i can click on the profile but i can't i can't kick keep clear no you're right i think you're right here it is kevin isn't it yeah that would have been awkward um okay all right so let's go are you ready i'm trying to figure out do i take the yeah yeah nice okay the other guy's connected we've got a scavenger scavenge um scavenging his name i only see kevin it looks like we're just playing against kevin then hey oh this might be a little easy fun kevin time to die are we in the right mode i don't know i don't like that sound system i got the propane tank propane salesman cover me reload it i wonder what difficulty the zombies are in this mode yeah yeah oh wow i hate that thank you so much watch out behind you buddy there might be something coming through this wall all right they've left them i think i think they didn't join as a team of four oh okay oh yeah yeah yeah i've seen the discord all right should we uh hold on let's just see what's going on so we did it we did it correct yeah keep away from the edge let's saw mr the fire rises what is that from eye horizon oh my god it is it's like a battle royale do you see that this is the same mode yeah it is the same mode yeah they've changed the ui maybe at the start or something there's just no one to kill us [Laughter] immediately adapted to the darkness i was born in it so if we won then yeah of course it counts yeah the way it works is like it's whatever team survives the longest so right now they'd be playing as zombies trying to kill us and we'd be trying to kill them yeah and they can choose which special infected they want to be as well right good job yeah and they can survive out in the storm and just chill for a bit and then come in and attack us i would like to be ready okay i've just seen we've all got to head to the boxing ring to pass time while we get the game set up properly yeah i feel bad i've left that's fine all right let's do that let's do that let's do that let's do that yeah all right i've john i 1v1 me let's go okay okay you ain't ready join up on me no i'm coming i'm going he's already in here as league of legends whoever gets to the boxing ring first oh i'm i'm at a menu right hang on i'm not really here i'm here no no no no no i can't see john he's not he's not here anymore have you oh i left you got to join back on me no but you said it's not saying you're online oh can you join leah i can join leo yeah johnny hey jimmy is here you're going down soccer that's a lot of blood isn't it for every punch yeah it's very gory and it rules it like is it a proper game or is it just like getting it right the one downside is we're not losing any health but it doesn't mean it's not fun an exhausted her grunt from mom right sorry versus um look at the boxing ring like floor as well oh no is that all from mom covered [Music] right yes at the moment we're just waiting the other team they weren't ready they would they were they were scared of them i think you did it they did it yeah it did 100 all this was one sentence what can i say over there we're ready to take you down well can you just press yeah yeah that's so good if there's like a drop somewhere like some the irish labs are free oh no are they ready to fight they can't handle the smoke it was cool as we oh with the pvp is uh accessed from here group two start private lobby and enter the code all right okay start great private server okeydokes might need a new code yes fakers away stream please don't look at the code all right i know it's on the screen please away look away now there was another way to do this i'm just doing parkour along the ropes look at this this is how you prepare that one looks very challenging for any of that parkour of course very challenging honestly try it it's not the easiest yeah you just get thrown off on the corners it's actually harder than it looks like you will do this and it'd be like actually hold on parkour parkour all right we go jumped up it's like no leah leo's like oh okay i want to be involved i would get involved oh no it's just like primary school all right a friend you need a friend in need okay so are there are we the so are we these guys first yeah we'll swap [Music] plus 10 team health i'll take it i'll take one for the team literally hellfire 45 move speed while firing sounds good i feel like that's a big one i increased everyone's ammo capacity as well lovely lovely all right we're the crates we're gonna need crates pretty quickly group therapy okay so they're gonna be the zombies where are they um where are the crates there's one here next to me oh yeah i found a couple of some bandages three bananas we're getting reports of what appears to be a cloud of insects oh yeah stock up on ammo prepare yourself i've got a defibrillator here also let's try and look for any like high vantage areas because they're gonna have to climb up to us yeah stick together as well yeah i think come close watch out for the cars definitely gonna kill us they can set the alarms off the cars oh no i've not found a good weapon oh yeah there we go on the bus right i got the aa shotgun how did you get there incoming car alarms gonna let the horde we get onto the roof oh no it's crazy yeah yeah maybe should we all be here on the same probably tonight or should we split up the perfect award for that moment [Music] i haven't seen any any of those guys yet any special infected have you one right at the very start there we go right near benny benny oh yeah thank you oh big boomer again on me healing and healing [Music] okay we've survived a minute that's good uh heal up if you've got the hills give me a minute oh yeah i need something even though that was a thing stun gun i've got a defibrillator which could come in handy yeah yeah for sure yeah there's ammo by me oh i've been pinned yeah the same place it was last time above oh no you didn't big no you don't i'm running i'm trying to run back to you guys watch out the roof above you is that for the settlers oh again oh oh no this is that thank you all right i'm just not gonna you got any heels another horde coming sound good i'm running i'm trying to reload you've got this do you have this no thank you keep it going keep it going yeah i thought we were gonna be gone then we need to get this big loud focus on me totally oh no i can't get in i'm stuck i just got mixed again hopefully there's some help in here yeah i need some help [Music] i'm healing up i need slime oh god oh no i don't know if we're gonna get anything oh my god be honest into the zone i'm chucking an ammo pouch right in front of me there's a jumper oh you just gave me ammo oh no charging land watch out watch out [Music] watch out what about that storm's closing in oh my god look how much of the maps closed in i'm did you put the ammo down john i think it only gives it to the person that's holding it oh no just gave me ammo there's a few pistols lying around if you are desperate just to get a gun with some ammo resin oh no no no no no no oh no didn't have enough time no if you all are not too four minutes 13 is good though that's how long we lasted that was tough right so there's that round one four minutes thirteen we have to kill them longer than they win shall we should we just target people really quickly i think we also need to like we need to make sure we all select to be certain ridden because we could gang up on one person with like a big person and then that one person just has nowhere to go what's the best one to go for what's for me you've got mutation points right so you see there's upgrades pick one that you think you'd like and then use the upgrades i don't know if they even realize you can upgrade these to make them better ooh okay what should we be there how do i do that common into the spawn pool that's pretty good i want to be a tall boy just because they've got i call it all boys oh yeah increase i want to compensate i might be uh an exploder self-destruct to do extreme damage i'm a stinger so i reckon that so let me just have a look at my abilities frenzy seconds overhead attacks burst burst forwards right now it's not me uh he's pretty good i think as well the one that pins you you know yeah like i feel like that's a really good someone's pinned ever all of us can just gang up on them yeah i'm a big melee lad well i'm just gonna i'm i'm just gonna i don't think they will look up i don't know they were using the rooftops pretty well themselves so how dare they i'm gonna go up here and just i'm just turning up here with jack this is the spot oh my god that's so epic if you if you sprint you can jump on the uh like uh playground slide and then bounce straight up who should we focus we should call who we're gonna oh they're putting barbed wire up oh we didn't think about that i mean there's a floor up here really where's the bar it's in this little door this doorway here on the uh we won't go in there on the right side oh do you think they could just stay in there though let's just climb through a window yeah but then that is to our advantage well it's to mine anyway just move them around if they don't just go into a room we should just spawn as the big explody lad and just vomit all over them yeah why they're all on the bus they're all men though how do we spawn in uh left trigger oh i might have made a mistake here that was a bad idea wait it's not quite come on oh in that case i just exploded on him now he's trying to fill up you can also respawn when you're in this in the swarm so you can just come i think you can just pin one there pin one [Music] there's a nice bit of damage though i think yeah the barbed wire the barbed wire girl is pretty pretty hurt right now oh wow i'm down yeah we need to focus john's right we should focus um maybe go for the barbed wire she's not got a lot of health probably like 30 oh she's just hopped out she's going into the other one yeah all right i'm gonna come back one's on the back of the bus yeah we gotta be quite quick here thin one [Music] yeah that's it the boss won the bus nice it's got this red she's ready so little help now oh no no no no they're focused on me i'm down oh i'd mess up badly there's no health plan as well you died i'm going to stay as the one that sticks people if you change benny and maybe go tall boy or the boomer perhaps i'm gonna go on the roof and then just play a bit more yeah we've got red hp here i just exploded on them once down one's pinned as well right now attack now attack attack put some damage there we go down i think they're down and i should be able to spawn right by them and just back at their body too close to spawn boy right i'm just mailing the one that's down yeah this is good that's an idiot i shouldn't have done that we've got one of them down at least so we know i don't think they're resting they're resting oh god i got that i got the rest as long as you focus on getting one they're gonna they're gonna be scared are they yeah yeah he's low he's low he's always in the gas he's going for the rezzes oh he's down he's down in the race they're just on the bus now we've got less than a minute to kill them here i'm going to check i don't want to go yeah all focused on the one there um leah's got grabbed i'm trying to move ah okay i did quite a lot of damage there ah we're so close come on come on come on come on we got this we got this come on yellow health here focus focus focus focus focus here we go oh my god less than 10 seconds less than 10 seconds smash [Music] wow that was so close oh my god oh my god seven seconds that was super interesting wow oh the trash talking work it actually did wow that was so close it was actually so close gg's diggies there's a different different map is it yeah yeah that was so fun yeah a bit better that tall boy is really good yeah boys are super useful especially upgraded uh right trauma resistance speed 50 weapon swap speed hell yeah right we got one that first round let's go i think it's pretty useful to like cheese their spawns that sounds really bad but like if you make sure everyone's got eyes on a different location they can't spawn next to you which is really helpful but when you're all looking the same way and you're all on the same location they can spawn behind you yeah that's a very good point yeah i didn't think about that because that's what we were doing right written activity scavenge hold them up as long as you can are there boxes with weapon upgrades here is there a better gun and that's what i need oh pipe bomb that's really useful there's a healing crate on me yeah um if you find a stun gun pick it up because you can save yourself if you get pinned that's a very good point what um i'm gonna ping there are some pain pills there if anyone needs something over here special i think there's one above us here john yeah i just beam everything up he's climbing up he's gone another one here kill this guy oh my gosh oh i one of them's so cheesy they're just camping up there that's fine but i get it but come on i'm really weak by the way guys um i've got bandage yeah i'm like i've got a defibrillator as well i don't need to talk it is there any assault rifle oh i'll rescue you big buddy give me there's a guy with a with it back in his arm and there's also a spitter just chilling [Music] a guy with a big arm he's so weak i'll go for the rest see if you can find that guy hopefully i don't get pinned i'm going to get pinned on gotta go i might just be able to do it oh [Music] to be fair though this is a much it's such a close quarters area yeah i think those armed guys are probably this yeah just all go tall boy there yeah one person pins like with the long range pin and the other ones go on boy i reckon that'll be pretty how do i go on boy oh we can you guys upgrading him all right 17 more for offense increase by the way if someone's got there we go that's okay that's almost max upgraded then so we're we are all tall boys right and our plan right is to burst and smash next players wait who who do we go for first like we've gotta just like picks pick someone if there's anyone on their own yeah which is probably unlikely but i think they will be let's just call him out though so john i'm looking away you are right now okay are you just just chilling up on that roof oh we just gotta beat these two up yep all right i mean you go for these two one of them if what we can do is if i can try and pin one of them behind somewhere where someone can't shoot them free while you all assault the other one so i think you can only do two at a time of each castle that one testing the gun i'll say that's who we go for i'll try and pin someone else i mean this guy's very very on their own here yeah he's by himself he's completely by himself oh my god smash hulk smash yes leo can i go john yeah john help out on that one yeah yeah i'm literally just waiting to spawn back we're too close to the sport yeah yeah nice nice time to be ready watch why i'm with you john oh my god they're just we'll just camp in there ah die to fire this one's really weak oh we might do this i'm just vomiting on them oh they hate that oh i don't know we've got any of them down nearly nearly they're all my mom's right now right it's gonna be after this but it's gonna be this push it's all or nothing yep here we go three two oh this one that's so weak this one right in front of me yeah he's down there down there that's so close last one kill kill kill yes i can't believe that worked oh let's go oh i think that's game i think have we won yeah i just got an achievement win a game in small mode oh yeah we thought it was over oh yeah oh you have dark i want dog he's so cool oh let's go yeah yeah that was fun that's fun that's one for the record books this is a really fun mode yeah yeah i want to play as a zombies the whole time yeah so fun so frustrating when you die immediately and you're like no i've got to wait to respawn no i'm glad we had a tactic though and the tactic you know it worked it paid off we found the meta already this is what i like to hear it's what i like to hear that's that's benny in a nutshell this is the best loadout for small mode right here we go if you want to win swarm mode this these are the top five things that you have to do first of all put all your points into damage for tall boys [Laughter] very good i think i don't know if we're playing another one we might i don't know yeah we've got we've got time for another we've got tam 30 minutes see if there's any new cards to unlock otherwise i don't want to keep going through the campaign yeah me too how far we can get but the next the next uh level's really cool i want to do that yes what's the plan what do we do to do that or do we do this i don't know i mean if i was them i'd be just too embarrassed to want to play again please just ask the question yeah one and jackson said one more work that needs to be done we want their revenge they want their revenge rematch so i think we're going to be playing one more game of pvp guys uh thanks for tuning in again that was fun it's really it's it's enjoyable playing as the zombies i like playing as the red and the infected i'd like if the map was a bit bigger though i think that'll be cool wilster what's up hello gabriel yeah scotty for sure for sure hey nando pc agent uh yeah it is on xbox game pass launch today as well paul tallboy meta answer enemy team is trash talking less were they were they was jacksepticeye trash talking is that what's is that what's going on abby is double dipping streams stream sniping are you giving them tips go easy on them i mean to be fair they put up quite a good fight let's go kick some ass it seems the counter to the tall boys would have just been to go inside yeah maybe hello salman from india what's up christian thank you for coming along to the stream appreciate you being here hey i mean you've got to have that having you for baby dancing on your area looks like you're swarmed for as long as possible what i'm going to do is i'm going to get a shotgun or someone in the chat say that a12 destroys boys it's like ah there's a big med kit here guys with a couple of painkillers no i'm just pinging something i've got frag i got two frag grenades i've got a pipe bomb i can carry three uh grenades that's crazy i've got uh wire honey reason why we probably want to set it up like up there i'm gonna set some in front of here so you've got a place to run into so in front of the garage take my molotov back [Music] i actually quite like the look of this but oh my god they've not realized what the tactic is there we go i got a triple kill i've just got triple kill on all of them has anyone got those meds ah yes let me heal you i've got two med kits if we uh need them yeah sorry i just i'm going back for those nades we've got about 13 seconds before they come back i love how you've worked out the exact timing boy here oh my god another one i've got one toolbox do you want me no no no no i need fell off the map there oh i'm in a very bad spot oh my god i'm in a bad spot it's okay we can kill these and rest quick activity thank god i don't know need help yeah get away from the edge that's a bad bad area yeah wait where the nades we need the grenades i just found two more i've got a pipe bomb fight bombs are great [Music] i think the main thing is forcing them to spawn in a really awkward a12 no i've just been vomit rinses people wow [Music] oh i'm thank you oh no i've got three hp in a dream i'm gonna try oh no he's going to smash me [Music] i think we did okay there yeah yeah we definitely we did well there like we got how many player kills we get a few we'll find out there's quite a few kills there i think yeah at least a bad start dig in and hold them back oh okay that was interesting um same same as uh before yeah let's do it tall boys it resets all the upgrades using the exploder guy and pushing them off the edge yes all right we've got level we've got level two on offense on two boys one defense all right how did we have three tall boys last time i don't think we don't know i was a tall boy in the in the last match yeah i was playing as the um hawker and then the the boomer guy the range of the hawker has to jump is so satisfying so last time they all ran from the same location and it was terrifying and amazing so i feel like we should do the same yeah we can we just want if that hopefully they defend around here you know where they've got the advantage of getting to go like go first in some ways just because you can see what the defense strategy works and what doesn't work right they've not looted behind here [Music] amateurs my only goal is to use unbelievable that's all i want to do is anyone john you playing a sticky lad um i'm the lad that can jump like crazy i don't know if he can stick if you right right click you got like uh um i can it looks like a wrap around them the other one on their own there we go yeah i think we all died very quickly then that molotov was quite good near the back seven seconds oh knock them off the edge okay they got the res but there yeah they got oh do they get the reds yeah yeah they i think they are the moms so the mama's quick okay that kind of locks you in there okay one one stop uh a sticky one yeah jack you got that one oh down [Music] there's one of them down right there man i took a lot of damage we got one minute we've got one minute we've got one down is ready raising now [Music] they still got that one person still really really low i'll knock one off one dead oh no i just ran off the edge of the map [Music] i just believe like you eat it off the map oh my god nearly nearly done there we go one more here you're gonna make it they're gonna make it oh my god no way oh we win that if leah didn't get trapped yeah yeah that's a good point all right it's fine right give them give it give them give them something all right that's what we get we're giving them something and then we'll take it away oh someone in my chat said jack scepter guy's focusing so hard he's barely talking look at us we're just having a laugh no they'll be having a laugh as well yeah oh yeah i i will right okay so let's tall boys strategy is going down i want to blame uh myself there because at one point i did just run off the map voluntarily don't worry so did i it's very easily done wait am i not a tall boy i'm a tall boy it's jackie also a tall boy oh no i don't know who else i don't know who else to play um you could be who i was last time uh hawker is it what is it worth is it worth um i was just going to say if you know what you're playing because i've got cool boy down yeah spend your mutations as well if you've got points yeah i spend i spend it all on tallboy well if you can um getting more board is really useful because it really dissolves oh yeah we've we've not done anything to our horde yeah i've always wanted to mess it up yeah because like they're so disorienting when you're surrounded by horde and you're trying to deal with the big ones uh what's my abilities is eureka frenzy charge okay okay all right let's go has anyone got the uh the sticky lab [Music] no but i can't be him next time i died straight away but it's okay all right we split them yeah already yes oh wow so quick i'm not even dead yet just waiting for my stamina that was really good i damaged the other one right one's covered in zombies right now yeah we've got this one as well and i press oh my god on that red body they are so close to death smash this is so much fun the other one's up on that uh on that van it's a little awkward okay one day for him hello just got them killed was that the quickest so far that was the textbook that was great oh so huge i'm so big well that was that felt like such a clean round that was beautiful i feel like if you stick to the the top areas you can do a lot of duking against the tour boys yeah yeah i like that just go look out for the wreakers like me because you can push them off real easy uh right what do we want ammo i've got team ammo i've spawned with a shotgun i'm not i'm not happy about that got an m16 oh yeah i've got an lmg let's make sure at the start as well use the propane tanks they're like instant kills do we need to move them strategically around the map um i'm gonna place one down yeah like let's just set them up there we've got barbed wire as well might be good up on the uh yeah up on the points yeah getting sat down so we can get up top we've got about half our time left to scavenge got some more meds over here might you want the barbed wire there's a d-fib here i've placed a rough wire there i've got defibs nice is that a good weapon oh no oh yeah ammo right here there we go [Music] i'm stick together oh straight boy they've got a spit up like hiding here's the thing we just stay up they can't get to us yeah well this table here is really dangerous okay we just gotta survive another 50 seconds i'm healing oh my god i'm close to close to death there's a boomer behind you benny oh no ah that was uh the one they're beginning to believe well they've won it it won yeah well i mean the first round they won by one second very good though ggs god damn it that was really good yeah that was living it was fun though yeah sorry mummy that's the biggest mom yeah never forgotten it's tough though because they just come from everywhere yeah yeah when the play spaces are that small i kept picking up assault rifles as well which are not useful for really anything yeah i think i i messed up with my weapon selection because i had a lmg and a assault rifle which is not the weapons to go with it's like i was shooting at them and it was just doing no damage whatsoever oh no bad times but ggs to uh to kev jack darthy minks they smashed it it's a it's a friendly draw yeah very think about that no competition whatsoever right what should we uh what should we do should we blitz right through that last level yeah yeah okay i'm down where do we actually blitz it um i don't want to say too much don't want to spoil it uh it's the boat one okay remember that one oh yeah yeah [Music] some supply points spend those chat we couldn't get the win [Music] we couldn't win the second game i'm sorry i'll let you all down it's interesting though like how quickly you can form a uh you know tactics and meta in a game mode like that third match decider i think some of the other guys have got to go death dealer so what we'll do is we'll we'll finish that first pve campaign and then later on in the week i'm going to continue we'll do the the next campaign i will be playing with other people though but it should be good fun hey scotty what's up i don't know zero g good matches yeah yeah i mean uh sean is uh is awesome like i'm sure that he let out a monumental scream upon winning that match it's fair play the eye is just too septic for you yeah he's too okay hey steven is this on game pass yeah it is it is thanks abby thank you are you guys enjoying this went too easy on them now they just beat us fair and square sky i think or did they yeah they did what did what did they yeah yeah they did we let them win no we didn't yeah we did no we didn't they just bears defense poor boy needs a nerf day one nerf oh dear [Music] i want to see what's in the box just need to cross the bridge i'm gonna keep that pipe bomb during rush hour extra grenade for you oh thank you i can buy another pie bomb then yeah lovely [Music] let's do this but you know i think it's for the best that it ended up i like that yeah yeah everyone won one yeah he's kind of annoyed but you know oh god outside he's got salt okay you see what means just basically just get to the bridge oh i'm being grappled oh no oh no i'm being i'm being held oh no that's melee melee melee melee this is a bit crazy we can right where is he he's
