a bit of bf4 today guys why not nice chilled out sunday in the uk so i thought i'd represent that with some chilled the f4 live gameplay commentary playing hardcore mode got the m98b sniper rifle and we'll see if we can get some nice shots here today beautiful looking map and it i say that about like all the battlefield 4 maps to be honest but still holds up doesn't it when you play at those high resolutions it really shines i feel like there might be enemies on the other side of this little hill there's one right there in the grass luna time i'm lucky mate some rocks there no chilling on the island these birds are making weird noises man what are they up to gonna watch out for this helicopter you get a good helicopter pilot on this map those things are devastating absolutely ruin you that was a little recon player there i do have the rangefinder on this as well although i'm not sure i'll need it on this map it might always come in handy you never know i feel like i'm going to get killed by that helicopter unless i do that can i take that oh someone else got it never mind and we're losing this point it's a big cave underneath do i go in here there's alone no friends there right we're creeping it was just the one fair play to the guy though to be honest coming over to aim capturing the point by yourself that's not bad they might spawn back here now any second no we got it i'll jump on with you mate let's go go go and go don't know where they're gonna date me can we get across there yeah i think so i'm gonna hop out here might be able to see the guys capturing the sea flag ow there was a bit of movement at the back there wasn't there i just got winged in the side there where from teammate it could have been yeah friendly fires on in hardcore mode i think the teammate just ruined me there 300 [Applause] just ranged in there i think that was a hit first one should have been a kill no it [Applause] wasn't what is going on you see what that guy said in the chat jack don't answer me if you know anything about bf6 it's an enemy isn't it that would have been a difficult shot by parachute here g18 is amazing man one of the best secondaries in the game nope can't do much about that i'm chilling there is there i need an engineer to sort out this attack but human frog i wouldn't want to be a human frog something just doesn't feel quite right about it although humans can swim and frogs can swim so perhaps i'm a human frog right now i'm now a dead human frog because someone was in the water with a dbv12 which is actually a shotgun so i think it's a shotgun anywhere what's this gun here oh it's the big rocket launcher thing one more got him someone's sniping me i feel like someone's sniping me right now gotta keep my head down that's unlucky for you isn't it man the fact that you don't regen health it just absolutely ruins you that guy was shooting me mid-air as well fair play jack i want to know i really love your videos and it warms my heart seeing you on rct i think that's the name of the server thanks i don't think i've ever played on this server before not often play hardcore did i see someone yeah i did are we losing this waterfall again that guy blends in really well it's a good camera anyone else oh my god dude you don't need to throw that grenade it's cool this engineer here what gun is that that looks sick is it m4 isn't it acwr maybe what are you looking at come on apparently it's not always a one-shot kill because i'm pretty sure i hit that guy then didn't i just didn't kill him saw the blood at least i was once again asking to become a human frog that's all i ever wanted so imagine if they did a ray tracing update for this game wouldn't it be cool if you could do auto ray tracing to older games like nvidia somehow develop that technology they can automatically do a bit of ray tracing i don't know how good it would turn out but we just swap positions in yeah we did this medic what did they have like a grenade launcher or something also ray tracing to older games that would be awesome in there is it possible though i don't know when i know they've gone back and done ray tracing for some games like they did it with quake didn't they damn it is that not a hit well i'm gonna move now they did it with quake too didn't they although i don't think that was an automatic thing i think they actually worked on that for a while also like it would definitely be harder with more graphically intense games like this i reckon it's a friendly a nice shot guys just parachuting in i think they're up ahead here you guys see that interview about apex legends apparently the next big update is putting a load of titanfall stuff in the game or something like that i don't remember where the interview was it was on one of the games websites and i think they were talking to like the creative director or executive producer of the game or something and they were you know like acknowledging the fact that the hell they're acknowledging the fact that apex you know it does still exist in the hostile titanfall universe and there'll be more titanfall coming to the game try and get this guy missed i'm all for that when i went back and played apex recently too high that's better last week with aculite and just had a great time and it was really chill really good fun but i love titanfall i think it's brilliant titanfall 2 in particular like that single player campaign there is not a second wasted it's quite a short campaign but every moment of it it's just quality look at this guy how did you even get on there that's a hell of a spot can you even climb to that well they got a spawn beacon in oh god the helicopter's coming yeah they use the spawn beacon to land on it i'm sitting duck right now i'm sitting frog you could say but if they put titanfall stuff in or more of it oh man imagine if there was a titan in apex i don't know if it would just be like a legend or i don't know like an event uh special temporary game mode something that would be sick i mean i've said from day one i would love it if there was a legend it was like a veteran pilot you know because the the guys that controlled the titans are called pilots so if you had like a vet a grizzled dirty a grizzled pilot who could wall run and maybe call in a titan as their ultimate for like a few i don't know like 30 seconds or something how good would that be i don't know man hey guys i've got one of the gunners i know i think i've angered them immensely so i'm moving what do you think they do i kind of want apex to like become more than just battle royale oh my god i feel like they've got such a big opportunity to expand on what they're doing you know put team deathmatch in or something or free-for-all doesn't have to just be battle royale flush it out a bit do some new game modes that'd be really interesting i'll definitely play it some more like will they ever actually make another titanfall game i don't know like single player especially fps you know maybe the audience for it's not that big anymore really expensive to make as well and you can't really give a live service with it either just dude follow me around looking super cool oh god dude just came out of nowhere you know with the nose club though no we don't have any medics in our squad unfortunately no no there is someone over there i thought i'd go for it you never know what would you put in if you were the director of the game aim down there to hit him in the head i got my ranging wrong i was shooting over there which is like 300 meters away had to aim lower was i suppressed then oh i'm water who who uses the mortar in 2021 come on guys we ain't got time for that oh my god guys have got those floating fish again are these stingrays people eat stingrays do they eat stingrays maybe i don't know i don't know if they float in the air like that though i assume not is that one of the lads of the ucaf what they have hold up that is the uk isn't it you have to wait though it's got a delay on it no i don't want that oh he's going for it oh god no no not right at the end of the round the attack boats are my nemesis i hate them so much i think that's gonna be though guys there's only a couple tickets left but there we go a nice chill bf4 for you on a sunday bit of sniping on lost islands i hope you guys enjoyed
