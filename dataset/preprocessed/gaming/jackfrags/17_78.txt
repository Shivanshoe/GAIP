hi everyone and welcome to lego star wars the skywalker saga now i'm really looking forward to this one i have to be honest with you i haven't really played that many lego games before but i am a massive star wars fan and this looks like it could be really good fun and a lot of the reviews just come out and they're excellent so i think we're in for a good time here i'm gonna be playing for a couple hours or so checking out we might do a couple of different trilogies but i wanted to start with the phantom menace because that's chronologically where this starts so we'll be jumping in there today and we are playing and streaming in 4k so it should look absolutely fantastic i can't have the music on unfortunately because of dmca and legal stuff like that so you'll just have to imagine the music or just sing it in your head or out loud deal i might you know what i might even do a bit of humming who knows but with that said we're going to start a new game here guys if you enjoy this do consider leaving a like if you're new subscribe and let's get our star wars on here we go so when you boot up the game for the first time you can select which episode you want to play now some of them a lot but the first one of each trilogy isn't so for example we've got the force awakens here you can jump into that one but last jedi riser skywalker they're locked and i think you have to play through this one do all the main beats and then this will unlock but i believe that you can jump around whenever you want phantom menace of course that's the first in the prequel trilogy and then we've got new hope as well now i think some people have already released footage of a new hope so we're going to start with the prequels i know the prequels have got a lot of love over the last 10 years or so you know when they came out people ragged on them a lot but as we've got older and the new trilogies i think they're a lot more appreciated than they used to be some of the characters obviously we've got the obi-wan series coming out soon looking forward to that so let's get into it then star wars the phantom menace here we go i'm playing this on the series x by the way i do have a pc code but you can't play that till midnight so on the series x today star wars you know how it goes episode 1 the phantom menace turmoil has engulfed the galactic republic the taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems in dispute hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships the greedy trade federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of naboo while the congress of the republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events the supreme chancellor has secretly dispatched two jedi knights the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy to settle the conflict i have to be honest when i watch this when i was 12 11 i had no idea what that meant i probably read it and when i don't know what's not really sure what's going on here but it's star wars so it's okay why is that droid wearing a chef's hat the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor request permission to board my silly shot yes of course as you know is perfectly legal what's that french battlefront bad feeling about this oh we find the ship it's simple remember guys it's for kids but adults who are 35 year old like me can also enjoy this you can tell up and down it's not inverted i would like to go forward there we go double tap a and hold a to boost oh baby don't we have to dock with this shoot oh that's a good sound i can adjust that time for us to get these negotiations underway where do i board here oh here we go let's get in is it mayor hello vatox thank you for coming guys look at qui-gon and there's only one kenobi hello there check this out man this looks nice like delighting oh i think there's some real-time reflections there as well looks like it i still have a bad feeling about this you know don't center on your anxieties obi-wan keep your concentration here and now where it belongs but master yoda said i should be mindful of the future but not at the expense of the moment be mindful of the living force young panama yes master this way ambassadors oh my god this is so cool look at him look at him go looks explosive jack singing is so good he's gonna get a strike i probably already got one to be with you honest how do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands oh i can lift objects types of cowards the negotiations will be short when they finally begin you mean is it in their nature to make us wait this long no i sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute get that there this is a little puzzle then heals the force put the things back together [Music] oh that music that's called dmca isn't it this game is me basically avoiding dmca and talking over whenever there's music even though i've told there to not be music so i'm just going to keep talking while the diocese gasps the room and we can still hear that music for some reason i don't know why the music is playing to be honest an attack combo okay and another one and another one so i can do i can do combos and then like add the force to them oh my god look at that yes yes i hit the explosive barrel and died it's fine i can collect all my lego bits oh i can throw it oh that is so sick give me your bits there we go can i switch to obi-wan oh i can yes hey scott what's up this is a block here false push oh no he gave up he's sad that's gonna explode dead again let's go baby really good at this

from the future i'm sorry i'm sorry we'll continue we will continue oh okay this way rescue queen amidala from the trade federation oh it's natalie portman isn't it annie i remember running around this in star wars battlefront 2. oh let's [Music] combo love it there's my sprint that i just unlocked i think i'm like i imagine they'll be taking her to their ship if their ship is documented that gives a slam slam right there was that like a counter attack there or something came up why on the screen are you safe now i believe so but who do we have to thank for our rescue well this isn't really oh it's queen amidala is it it's urgent that we make it it's an impersonator do you have transports i remember in the main camera nightly this way yours a guy's bomb bat oh good it's not too far stay close the queen is not safe i had little toys of all these when i was a kid on coruscant immediately i opened them really carefully because i thought if i open them carefully i could pretend that i'd never open them and then glue them back together they were never worth as much as the originals i did have a couple of the originals but they were from my uncle because i was born in 86 and i think return of the jedi was 87 so i missed all the original toys but my uncle gave me some of his toys like he had the original millennium falcon an 8080 he had some of the figures as well they weren't in boxes though i think he had the snow speeder as well she gave that to me keira knightley was padme's double yeah isn't that padme's double right now it's a fakie isn't it oh they just skipped that because it's a video game come on give me the y give me the y that's a counter attack that's awesome look at how she moves gliding along the floor beautiful we go to that big silver starfighter don't we yeah [Music] that's a jump attack that's cool jojo i'm not sorry i was about to say i'm sorry but really i'm not it's okay kill your beans where is the music you have to imagine the music rims you have to imagine the music this is her royal highnesses ship are you ready to go yeah kira was the double kd it was one of the first acting roles in there pretty sure there's the blockade [Music] did it there's not enough power to get us to coruscant the hyperdrive is leaking here master tatooine it's small out of the way the trade federation has no presence there you idiot georgia we told you not to drink it tattooed any suggestions on where we should land the monsters but spaceport seems like our best option for finding the parts we need more suspect is that what is there yeah the music is heavily copyrighted is there a mission where you're going to the kid's classroom and bio force i i don't think that's going to be in the lego game as much as uh as much as i'd love it to be i don't think it's going to be there did we get to see darth maul he's wait he's at the end of tatooine isn't he we have to go and do we have to go and find anakin and his mom and then we have to do the pod race highness command if they've got that i presume they have curious about the planet i'm padme one of the queen's handmaidens this is not a good idea that's real i'm a dollar but if the queen wishes it i know we need to find a mechanic selling i can play a sir i get a blaster yeah i do get out of the way civilians halloween disguise oh god what's that race called look at him god can't stand him lovable rogue jar jar binks let me guess looking for ship parts thought so everyone is you'll be wanting to pay watto a visit you'll find a shop annie [Laughter] annie right on there what have i just done to that banter it's fine you okay with it are you yeah let's break that pilot that's it you give me this do i put this on here no idea where i have to put it god this is so much fun guys i'm having a blast with this so stupid hey hey i need parts for a j type 327 nubian i have twenty thousand republic duct terries the public clerics are no good out here i need something more real you're a funny little boy there he is i'm building a pod racer we must have jedi reflectors if you race pods there's big race tomorrow on bundy eve you can enter my pod anakin the prize credits will more than pay for the parts they need the force is unusually strong with him that much is clear he deserves better than a slave's life the boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race well i've acquired a part in the game of chance i wager my new racing pod against say the boy and his mother no pod is with two slaves [Music] someone someone end him that's everything we need we should make our way to the arena i write this influence i can do a mind trick on it what panic i mean there's quite a bit of depth to this excuse me civilians did i just kill that person oh my god he's out of my black bar look at this they just fall over move out the way civilians yes what was that java doing over there up to no good so cool that you can i didn't expect to be able to ride this sorry i've just destroyed your ice cream pileck i i don't i feel like it's not working out great you know i mean the banter we we're not on the same wavelength right now it's fine i bet there's all sorts of easter eggs as well r2 you can't smash that stuff was it alpha thank you yeah this is really the first lego game that i've played properly i played demos of some of the other ones but never really committed any time to them there's annie are we gonna do the race are we actually gonna do the pod race i think we might [Applause] [Music] that's absolutely right and a big turnout here [Applause] i remember i had this game on the nintendo 64. i used to play it all the time star wars pod racer oh my i was so addicted to it remember concentrate on the moment feel don't think use your instincts i will may the force be with you is he gonna say wizard oh here we go oh big race it's going to be a challenge let's go whoa okay that's quite fast rapid it's rapid mushrooms so they just blew up no i just got bumped i was ready to take the shortcut i'll hit the boost [Music] now this is part racing [Music] complete not one two more to go god can i survive i don't know yes okay go i want to take the shortcut this time yes i remember this was in the original game as well oh my god i'm flying but they've nailed the audio as well sounds really good stop it move out the way how many hours you got geez someone just let's go go exploded i think i'm in second now right is that suburban i think that's the bourbon yeah the game on the nintendo 64 was awesome and then they had like an arcade version of it as well no he doesn't anakin skywalker will win it is destiny well i really messed up then didn't i take the shortcut i dare you no you didn't too much of a chicken aren't you it had like a really interesting boost mechanic it's broken again no that's terrible timing can i even catch the bulba now i think he's too far ahead he's right here he's right here we can do this we can do this [Music] come on come on come on it's a ball but don't you dare throw things at me that's cheating yes just like in the movie right the last second we win we win boom sends the bulba back to the stone age where he belongs [Music] and they love each other the huts you can't deplete about each other you knew the boy was going to win somehow you knew it you're right did i bring the parts to the main oh there he is look i'll come by your she's right there he's right there no you can make your dreams come true honey pack your things we haven't much time is he to become a jedi yes what about mom son my place is here it is time for you to let go i will come [Music] [Music] they i added the music there just so you could feel the sadness and emotion of that scene where anakin has to leave his mother on the desert planet tattooing and probably won't see her again until she's dead in a tent because the tuscan raiders kill her i'm sure he thinks you're charming obi-wan way more grumpy jedi come on let's go i don't like you are we gonna see maul again i think we're gonna see him again spoilers come on chap if you've not seen this movie come on there's no everyone watching

accompany me to the senate to discuss the matter there of course are we gonna have to do some politics the supreme chancellor has called for respect that's so funny he actually walks like that in the movie i swear though i must be frank he has little real power and it is unlikely somewhere of a new supreme chancellor who can take control and give us justice hmm are we gonna go see yoda the jedi council miss windy ready he is not that's not what he says hmm i'd like a big mark please ah here we are milkshake large first transports you will take us to the senate building i have some prior

of like that but you're drinking it we have to go to naboo don't we what's in the blue milk it's like they don't know what they say you can probably get the ingredients on the website i think it's

little lego bricks it sounds busting yeah it is the chicken there is there is so much to do i mean i'm just kind of going through the main story bits because that's what i want to do but i think you

just kind of doing the main story beats uh like i've already finished the first episode which was phantom menace uh but i think i could have spent like another you know four or five hours in there just on that one bit maybe there's so many collectibles and optional side missions and stuff that you can do so yeah i mean if you just want to get lost in something like this for hours it's there [Music] it always gets in the way i think we're going to get to fly the falcon as well i'm looking forward to that boom booty stomp maybe i could like lock that with r2 just keep him out you guys cover me that'd be great thank you [Music] yeah you can actually lock the doors god you just have to beat these [Music] there you go he's nearly done [Music] is it on the switch hole can you get this

pulling us in oh no it is on the switch okay you can't win but there are alternatives to fighting oh no guys we know what happens here don't we nothing to say hiding in plain sight on board sir send a scanning to a board i want every part of this ship checked yes sir i sent something a presence i have not felt seen yes yes no no yes [Music] this is ridiculous even if i could take off i'd never get past the tractor beam leave that to me careful everyone watch out even i have not disguised like you are it would be wise for me to keep my distance from this fellow to avoid raising it's hitman now isn't it hey guys it's just me another stormtrooper report to the control room but this stupid door is on the press again where's a maintenance droid when you need one just me doing my stormtrooper duties no biggie sir good day yes so you can use that and hack it beautiful there's another one here is that when [Music] i love those lighting effects look at the reflection there on the floor you see that it just kind of looked like a real-time reflection doesn't it uh so i've got to get the other one working don't it maybe there's something down here it can't go that way look at that droid where's it gone the one that had the helmet on look at the falcon chewbacca and i shall wait here until you deal yeah i must have missed something in here can't interact with that hmm what if i put
