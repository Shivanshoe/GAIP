see so this just released on pc today the original game came out in 2018 as a playstation exclusive i've already played it through on playstation 4 pro but i think that was in the quality mode so it was 30 fps but today we get the full fat experience as you can see here i am playing on everything maxed out and we're also 4k native and i had a little run around earlier on the game and it looks incredible it really does so i'm looking forward to playing through this a little bit on pc i am going to be using a ps5 controller i did give it a go with the mouse and keyboard but i think kind of game this is controller makes sense right i think you can use xbox controller as well if you want to on pc but i'm going to be using the ps5 also i have to say a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring the stream and video today god of war is available on the epic game store and if you guys decide to pick that game up or any other game do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that so welcome guys can see you all in the chat we're gonna get stuck in now i'm looking forward to this if you guys like this leave a like let's do it ah [Music] [Music] and what this tree [Music] ah [Music] damn [Music] soundtrack's amazing in this game so good [Music] so i found some [Music] get in the boat boy [Music] boy count the boys how many boys we gonna get the audio design as well incredible it's atmospheric still want me to tie to the boat boy 225 boys in this game apparently someone in chad said that is enough i'm on a boat i don't think you should keep a tally of the boys no but that would be interesting did something change the forest feels different everything is different boy try not to dwell on it yes sir if i was playing this through for the first time on pc i would be so hyped the tree weighs like 40 kilograms maybe pass maybe and also counter i mean the detail on the textures is just nuts like i think this is original quality i think they call it boys so far boy i know christopher judge though can't do it the sequel's out for this this year right i don't think they've given it a date though yet 400 kilograms [Music] well there do i see my mother hold there do i see my father well there did they call to me well there do they call to me other do they call to me oh there do they call to me oh there do they call me [Music] [Music] she's ready [Music] find your way home you are free [Music] is [Music] again [Music] i'm sorry [Music] squeeze [Music] this knife was hers now it is yours [Music] she knew shall we now now [Music] what are we hunting you are hunting deer which way in the direction of deer okay uh this way all right i guess maybe time every time father why are we doing this now i need to know you can survive the journey then we leave for the mountain depends on you hunt hunt what did you find tracks not dear though i'll keep looking what tracks are they [Music] hack silver it's a currency in the game isn't it boy you miss these huh close but also not dear see tips are too wide it's a bull mountain cup your mother taught you well i was wrong imagine playing this in a giant cinema with dolby at my son how good would that be there's 360 audio all around you what's the current boy count i think we're up to about 10 now or something like that more tracks yeah but they're two around it could be a wild boar good good now what boy we must jump [Music] this way boy derek thank you for the 13 months that's very kind two tracks they're fresh this way [Music] found it slow down boy sorry you are hunting deer not chasing it yes father you're gonna scare it there's another chest there so when i played through this the first time i pretty much didn't do much exploring at all i just made it you know i'm going to take it a bit easier this time do a bit more exploration see what i missed he broke our bridge how are we gonna get across step aside my axe wow this animation is sick as well i watched it behind the scenes where they talked about how much time and attention they spent on the axe [Music] [Applause] only fire holy fire when i tell you to fire i'm sorry do not be sorry be better find it thank you blunder [Music] find it [Music] it's confiscated that bow it's gone no you are not ready stay back they're called draggers aren't they i'm about to bury yeah the combat's just so satisfying on this i have um vibration on the controller as well first time i've played a pc game with a ps5 controller i didn't realize that you could just plug it in and it works another juggler you can do a quick turn as well can't you what's the burn for that [Music] yes they've never come this close to our woods before keep moving just to jack the dragon juggler it's very good sp i like that a lot why did they pin this man to a tree what did he do is there like skill trees and stuff in this game yeah there is jonesy all sorts of skill trees the skill trees for you for different weapons the boy all sorts oh yeah these things you have to find all the rooms [Music] then there it is there it is [Music] one of three lewin apples they give you max health right nine total apples in the world and chest up by magic so you can just become op yeah i don't think it's letting me do the quick tone yet teaching you the basics first and knock that down yes [Music] axe over here's this way i can see more tracks am i not allowed to go this way boy i'm exploring i can follow you you're done right you follow me climb up here oh there's something here you can just go down there love the way he just jumps onto your back like that oh walls like i didn't even kill me the first time i played [Music] there's a big chest there yes i imagine they were yes but they would have murders this boy we don't want to be murdered do we boy is there an fov slider no stone there isn't he can no longer use it we can i don't think so let me just double check for you camera i think if they changed or if they let you change the field of view they would have to adjust all the cinematics so i don't think that would work would be a lot of work and time for the dev studio to put in ultra plus reflections i didn't even see that is that ray tracing dynamic reflections okay interesting didn't have that turned on chris thank you for becoming a member at prawn joe cheers for the 50. i've got this with ps5 but never played a god of war game should i start at the start and jump straight into this one um yeah this is a bit of a reboot of the series joe like i played the first second and third i didn't play like the ps3 to one or any of the spin-offs but you don't i mean some of those older games are explained in this game they don't just ignore what happened so if you haven't got time to play through them all maybe just watch like a quick recap video on youtube i'm sure there's plenty of good ones out there or just play the game and you'll pick up some of what happened before anyway but i don't think you'll feel like you've missed out if you didn't play the first three they're very different types of games as well because they're quite old now right so some of the mechanics and storytelling and some bit archaic a good games just very different to this am i playing on a 4k screen yeah i am here up there you don't have to cap the fps i've just cut the fps so we don't get tearing we do what we please boy no excuses playing with v6 on 60fps can i have my bow back now can you hit it from here you can do ultra wide as well yeah we should get closer it's a long range headshot it's just come out on pc super yeah [Music] i went hunting with mother a bunch of times he never wanted to take me why now it was her wish and it was time okay so many cool nooks and crannies in this game hello boys [Music] oh [Music] try to carry that one i think i can do a running attack connor on your left reminds me of captain america there's combos you can do as well [Music] oh nasty crunk i just beat this game last week for the first time best playthrough ever yeah it's a quality game it's one of my favorite games ever very good what's down here on the left that's the way i came isn't it can't get out that way it's a little puzzle isn't it i remember this and we have to freeze it he froze it in place clever you're clever and then we can recall it so that closes that one opens where you're going i think he's this way i like how the game just wants you to permanently just go main go main go main every time you explore atreus is like bro what are you doing this is a nice area father [ __ ] wait for my mark boy relax do not think of it as an animal it is simply a target clear your mind steady your aim and breathe in exhale and oh my god good couldn't miss that one it's it's still alive up wyatt from utah how are you doing [Music] your knife no finish what you started [Music] i can't [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] xbox controller does work with this godito on pc i tested it earlier he's a big we have boy choice you can aim him as well you can tell him where to shoot specifically not ready wow it's fine it's not fine he's getting angry with me you do ryan in the head he doesn't need to get that's why [Music] i know there's a couple of easter eggs you can do with this there we go stumbled ow get control of yourself boys [Music] [Music] time for the finish boy look at me look at me boy boy look at me we did it [Music] you are not ready what you serious i found the deer i proved myself how am i not ready we are going home [Music] i haven't been sick in a long time i can do this you are not ready can't control himself [Music] i love that the game just gives you that fight within the first half an hour just like yeah we're serious it's a long way down boy boy boy boy bye bye boy boy stop disrespecting me oh yeah we can stun them can't we we put away the axe and literally rip him apart there it is there we go oh rip and tear until it is done oh my goodness did you see how i ripped him apart boy it is a simple affair rip and tear until it is done i'm not sure i can get through here can i still can't get the doors open huh was that quiet insult there i'll be back for your door [Music] i just want to play the whole game melee has anyone done that in the video yeah god of war completed on the hardest difficulty melee only fists only is it even possible oh it's an icy lad i remember you so you can't use the axe against this guy watch doesn't do anything i've got to punch him [Music] the trays can help thank you for the five story i told you something was different about the forest and i told you not to speak it is a bit mortal combat yeah what if i leave that there will it despawn that's it but why would a fire troll burn mother's garden and since when are drivers so close to the house and what was that frozen thing that attacked us i do not know now be silent we are almost home inside it does sound a bit like group but it's not been diesel now christopher judge [Music] ah [Music] hey [Music] [Music] do i think they're gonna do ragnarok on pc i think so but i don't know i don't think it's gonna be soon after it releases on playstation not lighting why did i expect you lost control that thing was trying to kill us it's not like you don't get anger in a fight anger can be a weapon if you control it sparkling you clearly cannot when you i haven't been sick in a long time i'm better now fine come on then you want me to hate i want you to try [Music] ow will you try again why are you doing too slow try again cut it out weak again again your anger you can get lost in it that ahead is difficult and you atreus are clearly not ready come on out there's no use hiding anymore i know who you are what's going on do you know him more importantly i know what you are boy beneath the floor now but you told me never to go down there who is that i do not know what you talking about i do not know get in just tell me what i want to know no need for this to get bloody i thought you'd be bigger but you're definitely the one long way from home aren't you what do you want oh you already know the answer to that whatever it is you seek i do not have it you should move on and here i thought your kind was supposed to be so enlightened so much better than us so much smarter and yet you hide out here in the woods like a coward [Music] you do not want this fight [Music] [Applause] i'm pretty sure i do leave my home you are going to have to kill me for that to happen [Music] i warned you finally you would not listen no no fine might [Music] how incredibly disappointing come on then dude was pulling his punches [Music] can't dodge that one so good he doesn't care about getting axed repeatedly [Music] come on either i don't think you can parry that one can't [Music] why are there two bets [Music] struck a nerve did i you want some i'll give you no so can't try again not like this you talk too much it might be the matrix on this neo versus agent smith you won't talk fine maybe whoever it is you've got stashed in that house will uh oh [Applause] who is it who are you gonna find let's find out [Music] lovely spawn ranger the trees everything what are you hiding i don't have time for this that's so brutal [Music] the choreography and animations top tier man [Music] i think we're going chris i think he's i think he's dead leaving so soon yeah when odin sent me here i just needed answers but you you had to act all proud throw whatever you have i'll keep coming that old body will get out but before i end this i want you to know one thing i can't feel any of this [Music] ouch you've seen it with your own eyes you can't hurt me nothing can this fight is pointless your struggle is pointless it didn't have to be this way you can't win i feel nothing but you you feel everything yet you you keep trying i'm not my brother if you've given me what i wanted it wouldn't have ended this way but no sick dodge let's finish this you can't beat me it is a leafy attack now oh i feel nothing he turns like i see for a second i wonder if that means anything this guy wasn't lost as well you guys remember him from lost tv like that you can't beat me sometimes i think i prefer using the fists we got him ugh would finally make me feel something but you can't oh [Music] no it's not charlie from lost he was he played a scientist he was in saving private ryan as well he was the coward at the end i think really good actor though he's not been in much but he plays this role so well i think they mocap this as well it's not just voice work they provided for this game they actually did the mocap as well must have been so expensive to make this game there is a great documentary on this game as well on youtube two hours long and it shows how they made the game the challenges they face the delays fun e3 reveal very good fray what do i do our son is not ready to carry your ashes to the top of the mountain is he dead quicks we'll have to find out dr faraday yeah that was it [Music] he does look a bit similar to charlie but it's different character i do not know how to do this without you [Music] yeah it's called raising kratos the documentary i've just noticed right i didn't notice this on police station you see the rules there's actually runes chiseled into the side of the house there with the wood you can really see the detail there in 4k crispy jeremy davis yeah that might be it there was so much i i thought you're all right i am all right come tell your things we are leaving we are leaving in the direction of deer that i wasn't ready you are not we have no choice now prove me wrong yes sir [Music] the mountain it's gonna be a long trip yes but an important one whoa how did this happen there was this guy he came out of nowhere we had a big fight it was just like a trace you know when you watched dragon ball on tv it's kind of like that you know [Music] is there any other collectibles here i don't think so something over there a bit of hack silver all of a sudden he is clean well he's got he's got god powers he can just regenerate you seen the cutscene he just went and did his spawn rage and then after that he did this little like regeneration thing goes through there yeah am i going to do a full playthrough of ragnarok when it comes out yeah jack i am for sure that'll be on ps5 though because i don't think that's going to come out at the same time on pc who was he i do not know why you want with us we're nobodies did you kill him i did what had to be done i needed him down there son what control are using a ps5 controller clumsy it was just plug and play just work straight away never leave me alone again all right all right you're okay down there do you think that's one of the best boss fights in the history of video games i can think of some good ones but that one's definitely up there it's one of the best it wasn't colin mcgregor people before haven't you you're used to it we do what we must to survive animals i get their food stronger they're supposed to be dead but people they're trying to survive too close your heart to it is hdr in the game for pc yes i think it is all manner of creature but the detail in these rocks desperation close your heart to their suffering do not allow yourself to feel for them ray will not feel for you oh i understand has this been here all this time why don't you hold me up there yeah i can get a better look get up there boy ragnarok is gonna be kratos bullying asgard okay maybe nowhere to go from here except across this bridge think you can lower it from there go made it boy yes sir boy can i freeze on him it must be a collectible there or something what fps am i getting 60 i've capped it at 60. reason i've done that is because um the way that my capture card works for 4k 60fps if i don't cap it at 60 and i don't use vsync it gets a lot of screen tearing this way and i don't want you guys to have screen tearing so i jumped that oh yeah boy move out of the way hendrick you thought this was a video no it's live dude we are live streaming [Music] father will we see others on the road yes friendly no they'll try and rob us possibly yes which gpu asus tricks 3090 can you just drop that down is that a shortcut yeah it's a shortcut isn't it when you come back here yeah 60fps makes a big difference to how the game feels as well like i said at the start you guys may have missed it if you just tuned in i played this on ps4 pro 30 fps and there's a lot more input lag the controls on is responsive but with 60 it's just it's nice man there's been a protection stave around our entire woods but the staves broke in there did you cut those down she hadn't marked the tree she wish used for her pyre why'd she do that [Music] come no looking back now i wonder who would win kratos versus wolverine [Music] oh that's a tricky one because they can both regenerate but one of them's a god i don't i think kratos would win can i get my axe back so they use these areas as loading screens by the way in video games do not know before winter falls i do not know okay okay if you're playing a video game especially a single player that's like really high production quality like this and there's a small space that you have to squeeze through where the field of view is very limited and there's not much on the screen usually they're using that as a loading area so as i was transitioning through that they've just loaded this new massive open world bit here are we going to attack yes they're all sir [Music] behind me starts to get a bit more colorful now as well doesn't it [Music] pathetic [Music] nothing in there hey girls give me the quick turn now look alive oh you can one hit kill those with a heavy attack god huh oh there's more let's go while you're doing that takedown you can actually teletrace the fire as well just a neat little feature love it how was that can i help if you want to help distract them whoever is not my focus should be yours but only when safe to do so i can do that look there basically if i'm hitting someone you hit the other person watch my back kid look here there's a yet no settlement ahead yet no creators can't read you can read the writing some just the language is mother now but they're all sort of connected so sometimes i can feel my way through stuff i shouldn't know you know [Music] he's a special boy boy nearly got that range mere filled up there it is this is back the way we came yeah it is isn't it just wanted to check that we got everything in that area mephisto what's up man i was hoping to see you play this today thank you the combos are hard here can you not see them pride of the frost [Music] i haven't even upgraded my armor once have i yeah you can put gems in the sockets or runes i think they're called and they apply different effects to your character that gives me defense too symbol of perseverance death's vow yeah so this is essentially just upgrading your stats it is a cosmetic change as well though [Music] you get that barrel down it's too far away am i playing with controller yeah i can't i mean look i mean there you go there's mouse and keyboard so i can just left click his light attack right click this heavy attack control is aimed like that i think you know just playing with control is way better for a game like this anyway but if you didn't have a controller you could use it on this game awesome keyboard [Music] around there gotta go up can i upgrade the trails at the moment yes i can [Music] [Applause] yikes i think it's so cool that these playstation exclusives are ending up on pc i mean i have a ps5 but it's just nice to give people the option you know hey i think there's a chest over here like horizon zero dawn two is it forbidden west i don't know i don't think they've announced that coming to pc but i imagine it will seeing just the first game did [Music] oh yeah we've got runic attacks now so these are just modifiers where they do like more damage l1 and r1 you can upgrade them as well cool [Music] we don't have a heavy one yet i've got all these different skins what the hell that's sick well the blue one's cool look of ages [Music] r1r101r2 last of us would be real nice yeah i think the uncharted i think we can go through that's coming out the end of this month isn't it or end of next month right but it's it's just uncharted 4 and lost legacy i didn't actually play lost legacy so i think i'll stream that as well move thanks last of us one and two apparently there's rumors of the last of us remake have you guys seen that it's fine i don't think they've confirmed it though but i've seen a lot of rumors oh no kid stay calm almost there oh that wasn't so bad slow down your haste will cost us it's a lot of drag sorry ugh more drawer but these aren't moving are they dead i mean more dead boy [Music] not dead not dead [Music] try it out accuracy over speed yes [Music] bye-bye i'm going to save my swelling rage i'll play the rooney kazak oh yeah three of them [Music] it's a big aoe either isn't it if you want it to be does not matter if you fire only once show me control show me the control boy [Music] look at this there's rumors of a metal gear solid remake as well which i would absolutely love never seen anything official about it though what's the point of that is that just a bit of environmental smashing that you can do read it oh this used to be a marketplace the giants used to gather here to trade with the gods a long time ago i wonder if phone was over here breaking through the wall up there with what [Music] [Music] that's what i wanted not yet i'm gonna power you [Music] [Music] i love how their blood is kind of orange bit different isn't it i drop down there maybe there's another way around there's an opening up there uh do you hear that what is it it's a creepy witch stay close what is that doesn't sound very inviting [Applause] it's an old huge oh hold on to me come here oh my god you can't actually use the razor i'm sure you can [Music] i just wasted my spelling rage i was like okay right i'm sick of this let's go couldn't even hit her once with it don't have enough for that do i could do that one though freezing throw shield combat you can upgrade all your rage as well you can also upgrade a trace a trace will help create us when enemies are in certain vulnerable states or when kratos is attacked stun damage attacks okay [Music] good job boy [Music] i don't was there anything else in this room that i missed there's a creepy skeleton i won't do anything with those oh there was a bucket oh down here i imagine we're gonna go down there at some point i still don't understand why that man attacked you at our house i told you boy i know nothing more of it he was simply evil look up there mario kart looks so good in 4k yeah this is the new mario kart george for sure maybe i did miss something then in that room not sure go all the way down here thank you [Music] i'm not ready [Music] oh [Music] tried to do my big frost attack and get him yeah if we go down it hits pretty hard doesn't have this guy the big chungus let's do that again i thought it'd be a lot easier to fight than he was down here lots of unlockable attacks [Music] much more sensible that time i rushed into it a bit i think yeah i'm good thanks how are you what's that what's what smells awful some weird goop some weird witchy goop boy don't touch it don't drink it don't put your face in it good life advice though wait you don't suppose revving and traveling packs do you and there's a bunch of them waiting up there for us and they're really mad earlier you said people might try and rob us i'll kill them if they try i'm not afraid if we encounter men you will stay out of it understand but i can fight you will stay out of it boy speak no more of this boy i nearly missed that good job i look back i think that was a nice chest to pick up there love the pog even thank you stinger yeah it was fun to go back and play pubg i think there's a lot of hype right now you know it's gone free to play the play base i think they had one million concurrents a couple days ago how to smash a drauga and destroy their head with your feet now i can teach you that when you're about older that's the wrong way boy it's runes then what's that over there one there's one down [Music] i did it all these things are so annoying in the big room maybe i can only see one in there pretty sure there's only one there one there [Music] where is the last one what the bird i think i missed it [Music] [Music] i want to find that last rune there's a little chest here hmm i don't see you guys you have to kill the bird he's up there what are you doing londo yeah the animation's sick isn't he when he opens the chest so good there it is is this more apples what's this one then [Music] yes okay more potential health how cool is the axe yes okay i know the eyes of odin one of 51 there's 51 of those is that like the golden skullchillers in legend of zelda ocarina of time where you had to find the spiders crawling on the walls there was like 120 of those wasn't there [Music] i'm going to give her a beating this is it isn't it this is the way oh still the other guys come here yes i love that you can do that oh [Music] watch out boy you're going to get yourself killed oh he's gone tough stuff there will be more so they were ranged guys but they were a bit tougher i love that spawn rage though man awesome i guess we need to get back up there but how follow me follow me boy no i played it before nameless played it on ps4 pro i did actually stream it as well but i was playing 30 fps can i not get that in there you did it nothing else here all these dead you think it's safe in there cheeky chests out here soft spartan helm steel what do i do with that then oh what's that smell something disgusting me cannibals what if they change like the others we'll have to keep them alive strip off their meat this fight is mine alone [Music] there's more [Music] does it do more damage to them if you hit them in the head yeah i feel like it does but i don't know [Music] oh my god he just stabbed him in the eye pg boy boy [Music] just killed a man sad times close your heart to it come then we have a long journey [Music] i need change straight away the fps isn't capped no you can uncap it if you want i will handle this i will handle this oh [Applause] should be more than that they came back it is finished i want to leave here then collect yourself we must find a way out i use nvent bk on a stream in pc on let me just punch some ancient vases how about that the chain there is always a way out i give him a lift up there up here maybe go drop the chain okay i said what's the baptist [Music] hey apex thank you i'll join you on the stream appreciate you being here yeah he's killed a few people already but they they're not men they weren't alive they were just dralga right dead i think that's the first time that he actually kills a real human let's say and maybe he's just a bit emo andreas the jane jane right [Music] can you play with keyboard yeah you can you are in your head boy let it go he would have killed you i know i had to do it i do know that i just and we will go home boy what to give up this easily so close to the start wait no i'm not giving up i can do this i just have to catch my breath come on up i'm ready drop it any criticisms yet no i mean it's already a really hyper polished game just runs better and looks better now listen to me this idea to be effective in combat a warrior must not feel for his enemy the road ahead is long and unforgiving no place for a boy you must be a warrior real i understand get up and move your ass i'll take you square in the ringer you don't [Music] let's go isn't he talking to a pig or something making that weird noise were you playing ready or not earlier today no i haven't played it for a while come on already let's go that looks like the way forward doesn't it yeah it's a giant thing stop hitting it it's cruel

[Music] is it goose never been this close to the mountain before looks so big [Music] i wish mama's here to see it [Music] come boy out of all the things in the chest you just grab a horn horns can be quite valuable you know especially in this day and age ah more of those norse mythology than that but if i've got enough to upgrade yes okay cool ranged combat close combat a leaping attack that sounds cool [Music] need more xp that's good one i remember that magic combat increases arrow damage [Music] let's go with that i felt like that's the mistake that i made last time i played this i didn't upgrade a trace enough oh man look at this what is it boy look there are rooms written along the side [Music] what's up latin how you doing i was thinking about saying that val but then i thought maybe i shouldn't do you want me to read these runes what does it say as we are we too we three as i alone can never be a riddle hmm maybe there's a clue around here maybe you're the club i have to freeze that one there and then freeze that one okay i think that part's right that's it i see rose what's it say boy boy what do those runes say i can't read boy it says family that's not a clue it's the fast and furious atreus i alone can never be right use your knife and trace the rooms where's dom doretta where is he come on this is a window where is it something happened it worked is this game smooth yeah it's as smooth as you like it's quite it's quite smooth i've just got it locked to 60 fps i'm happier we're leaving this place it is behind us now it is behind us now boy okay excuse me dice was that not a hit oh boy these tracks hmm a boar maybe not sure but i'll find it go it is important for a warrior to keep his skills sharp big old bull [Music] oh dear i can do that as

together you're a pig through there here what does it say no good comes from them the sea put the chain down so i don't even need to ask him anymore yeah boy huh interesting i may want to write that down hmm i haven't seen it anywhere unless it's hiding over there maybe no i don't think it was there somewhere over here there sure is a lot to see here oh there it is this is a timer isn't it i really have to aim it high nice oh not lock the 60 output no you can unlock the fps phoenix increase my health there cool yeah look in the options here i know a lot of people have asked about this but here you go um so we're all maxed out there it goes up to 120 fps is the limit that's as high as you can go i don't know if you could tweak that with a config file maybe maybe you could but 120 is the limit i don't think you need any more than that for a game like this for an fps yeah definitely you see an advantage but for single player hack and slash now 120 is fine was a bird there was that hey wait for me i'm sure i could hear it but i couldn't see it where is bob oh there it is the direction of the sound is a bit hard to pinpoint such a nice looking area this i'm limiting it to 60 because 60 is the maximum that my capture card does at 4k and if i have it over 60 you start to get screen tearing and we don't want that let's go see his pig boy are you your animal ahead yeah i think elgato hopefully will bring out hdmi 2.1 capture cards this year already so you can do 4k 120 height is thick but i hid it didn't i i do you said it looked like it bounced off could the boar be magical it's a magic ball what do you think it looked weirder than any board i've ever seen get after it then the father-son bonding here see you later neil where's my axe and my axe stay alert one of those people well cpu with gps i just do set up exclamation marks you can see what i've got what bodies are those weird dead things just wanted to remember what the hotkey was for that [Music] i have the cpu overclocked as well it's like different speeds for each core on the p chords the e chords are clocked at four and the p fours vary depending on the quality of them like if you know about 12 series overclocking you'll understand what i mean so the better cores i have clocked higher like 5.3 5.4 and the ones that don't perform as well i have them clocked to 5.2 5.1 probably doesn't make sense too much many people watching the stream but those are those enough now shoot in his butt i got it in the butt elbow up steady hand relax go over the headshot accuracy one d one d atreus got him yes well do not lose it nobody i've played through it once before on ps4 left his knife it's too hasty boy boy boy where are you chill i've got to smash some boxes okay address on the right wait for me boy

grows just behind the house can you pull a cluster what else i i know you're a god not of this realm but there's no mistaking it [Music] he doesn't know does he about your true nature or his own that is none of your concern the gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders trust me i know when they find you and they will they'll make things difficult the boy will want answers that will be my problem whatever you're hiding you cannot protect him forever but you're right doesn't concern me i also need lamb's crafts do you mind it's a white petal flower in my garden just a handful [Music]

were actually real nightmares yeah they get people nightmares but they aren't i don't remember which nightmares aren't really so it's not a nightmare is it a burst of health l1 a circle to activate i

[Music] that was cool we've got another chest down here there's one there as well isn't that heavy yes yeah atreus doesn't know that his dad's a god kept it from him i think he's beginning to realize that the law in this game is so safe again there is mason cool do you know what is under the surface no fish it's pitch black then do not touch the water what [Music] maybe we come back to that i can't do it till later yeah i thought so these things are weird [Music] you're not tired already kid hold on it's zelda smashing time yay now we'll get to the mountain quick i just can't believe that's here during all of this there was a time i thought i'd never leave our woods or even my own beds you are not to blame for your sickness oh i know i guess i'm just saying this is great [Music] there's the mountain look how close we are to it we flow into sea water how do you know do you not smell it that smells deceit it's salty and stinky seaweed reminds me to say look at that it's thor that's more god of thunder that's right i never thought you'd listen when mother spoke of the gods i seldom did did she speak of one who could feel no pain oh that sounds like voldemort an acer god son of odin and free and odin is king that's right why do you ask i think i see something because he's the one that attacked us kids i see rooms there miss chest he can't make it out read it boy it reads sacrifice your arms to the center of the water awaken again the cradle of the world what throw our weapons into the water guess that won't be a problem for you are you gonna do it you can always

temple it was all just under the surface except for the statue good thing huh there's even a dock there next to the flag [Music] we're going to the dock first right we'll be the first people to walk on it that's so cool you know of that serpent he's one of the giants he's so big he's wrapped around the whole world and bites his own tail an exaggeration i don't know looks pretty big to me i don't think he could go around the whole world how do you think this has been here a very long time i'm back to that a frog 4k frog is this the way to the mountain it would seem if it isn't the bearded beaver it is sexy if i got something for you too rock oh god but how did you none of your [ __ ] business now get in here i got something for you and don't go making pig eyes at my spot i saw him first okay what do you think he wants to test our patience when word gets out about my new shop folks will finally come out of hiding they'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wheels you watch you rust around like that everywhere yes catch the pile of rocks there with that key of interesting you can open a magic door branches of the world tree a shortcut between the realms if you ever see them out in the world use it to get back to me quake but it's only one way straight back here and nowhere else and whatever you do never never ever never ever throw yourself over the edge of the path unless you want death yeah i don't see us running back i'll do it i'll throw myself off come on in man so much for peace and quiet do some upgrades maybe need some more materials for those don't i oh bit of a downgrade that one what you need kid i like that you know being small like us that's natural armor he's gonna give me health if i get low okay hang out for you axe pommels each pommel increases stats and provides unique perks based on your access in combat hmm i'll go with that one [Music] roy's a gaming is this on pc now yeah out today a moo kit thank you for the five hope you're having a great day thank you man is there thank you right i think we can spend some of this on upgrades see that's quite a good one isn't it don't quite have enough xp though for that let's have a look at the skills 900 what are the shields i've not really done any double tap l1 to break an enemy's block okay a forceful haymaker with spartan rage i'm gonna go with that one break some blocks [Music] yeah we don't get that to later in the game the magic combat teamwork [Music] cool see you later bro i remember this bit on playstation 4 pro the fps was terrible because it's like a really big open high detail area and it was quite laggy but it's just 60 fps constant here what's up cold hands i don't know what this does apart from raise me up is that literally it what is this a horn a horn here's the end can we blow into it without knowing the outcome well we usually push every button pull every lever we see outcomes we can predict no this is something else we must develop your instincts i knew it we are blowing the horn no we are testing your resolve i have resolved a bunch of it i won't blow into it if you don't i won't blow into it if you don't come back to that i don't remember is this the elven bit trace advanced combat okay so he's gonna start stabbing him need more time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] explode next gen fish i don't know these rings if we find a cipher i bet i could figure it out i would like to know what it says boy enemies choked by trace will take increased damage that's the basic one isn't it that one there i'll blow that up that's cool as an eagle oh [Music] how's that not a hit a raven sorry not an eagle just gonna go see what's down here i missed anything a new boat dock found okay does the ps5 controller on pc still have good haptic feedback um i don't think it's got haptic feedback for this game it's just got vibration [Music] sorry get him boy sorry it's some kind of drawing maybe a map a map maybe a treasure there's a way to bring these spikes down what's he looking at what's the drawing i've seen me drawing [Music] go go [Music] more apples can i miss something now what's he looking at kid i don't see a drawing you're talking about i mean that was one of the urns that thing no idea [Music] did you get the cipher pieces no i haven't got any cipher pieces i don't know he can see something that i can't see i think maybe i have to come back to this nothing around there god it's so cinematic i love it a giant snake a world serpent i don't know kid i think you're seeing things look up there atreus it's in your journal okay cool thank you so if i oh [Applause] can't go further there until later on i told you we should come back with a cipher wanna be that guy yay [Applause] oh i still can't read these i'm gonna keep asking kid wonder you'll know i still can't read these what is that poison yeah you don't want to go naked [Music] boy over here look it's the world serpent this is cypress bigger than i imagined i think oh look he bit thor oh no or will bite him looks like there's a bite on the boob over there and how about that nothing above me is that okay into the poison good evening milhouse oh [Music] [Music] oh give it to me rats what now how do you know all these things there's a fancy chest hey it's a fragment of a language cycle oh there it is we should look for more like this a realm of fire what do i do with this boy okay i think you get to knock those down don't you oh what were those things they smell awful your mother called them scorn poles poison magic she was the one who showed me how to disable them [Music] what it's just funny to think of her teaching you something yes why is that funny kid am i might joke to you yeah i missed something over here so i'm gonna go check it [Music] first time in the stream what's up pollox how you doing thank you for coming along here appreciate you a bit dubious so i came isn't it i don't think i could jump onto that from there [Music] why is it ps5 controls because i'm using a ps5 controller then a bill you can use ps5 controller or xbox doesn't matter or you can use mouse and keyboard whoa sure is foggy here have i ever played the witcher 3 i've played little bits of it harry i've not played it all the way through you should no that's his brother he is of no consequence uh excuse me but um how did you come by that uh axe that is my concern alone and uh while i won't dispute that i i know that blade it was one of ours but uh we didn't make it for you step aside i can't see the woman we made it for i was uh well i am quite fond of her and i would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her it was my mother's good luck she left his father before she died face dead i'm very very sorry to hear that she was a fierce warrior and a good woman [Music] okay i will make improvements to the axe yes but nobody asked you to well it's it's true but but knowing your mother she would have insisted i repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my brother i knew it you are brock's brother the other half of the brand's here the blue one is your brother yes he's so big no my talents are vastly superior no boast i swear to freya do not undo his work improve upon it only yeah but can you can you put it down over there that handle is no filthy okay then i'll just i will just oh oh oh oh has that dried blood oh so what were you working on oh that i call it the sky mover just up that mountain awaits a treasure trove of rare resources once i mine it i'll need a way to bring it all down and you know how to fix it not even a little he's awesome what can i do for you too resurrection stones oh yes these came in handy basically it's a self-rest if you die give you a second chance atreus comes over he goes boom and you're back in the fight one at a time [Music] increase his luck by five i don't even know what luck does for you in this game is it if an attack is critical or a stun maybe something like that come back any time cheers my dude oh he's a big lad oh there's another big lad atreus follow [Music] i'm ready i like that he does close-up attacks now i don't know where's that coming from hello tradekill we said we'd zoom the camera a bit in combat yeah i mean we talked about this earlier right with this being pc you think because you've got more performance they may have allowed you to change the field of view but i think the problem with that for this game is that because the whole game is presented as one continuous camera they would have to reduce so many of the cutscenes and animations and that's just so much time and effort to do that so it's just maybe a better idea to just not let people change the fov it would have been so expensive to change all that would have been nice to have the option though are we getting closer to the mountain we are i saw you hmm i bet people will mod that yeah maybe they will doomfire maybe they will it might completely mess the camera up though we'll see i feel like i should just wait until i get like like green stuff like sorry uh like blue stuff or bubble stuff before i really start getting stuck into this you know i think i was i'll here back and have a look there [Music] i won't do anything with those mom called it hell's not rambling [Music] [Applause] [Music] you've really got to stun those don't you you get a trace to stun them and then you just rush up on them didn't use any of my rune attacks let's check back here there was another way wasn't there don't know what that is peculiar get over here it's one of these again it's locked magically you're a lot magical why am i playing this on a gamepad on pc just because it's better with the gamepad so i don't know it suits me better you know do you think for this last leg up the mountain feels more comfortable maybe i can sit back i told you no this makes more sense under control of this type again for me anyway anyway what i just meant i spent more time with him you were off hunting it would save you to stop talking ow that's cool you could actually destroy that i ruining that charge of the white bear r2 or r1 form a shield sound follow-up that's sick i'll try that so i have to do what are you doing [Laughter] dad stop embarrassing me please [Music] is that gonna be better cool down yeah it's a bit of a trade-off isn't it i'm just going to leave it for now with the armor i just want to check that skill again [Music] oh animations are lovely good evening router how you doing hello jack i played horizon zero dawn i played the first hour of it and there is a video yeah and pick this up [Applause] i can't remember why i didn't finish it at the time it was just [Music] it was too long for me it was too busy [Applause] [Music] father look ready yourself [Music] this is much more like the older games this kind of thing [Music] can't do that that skill that i just left down boy here who built this place [Music] not worth it till mid game okay thank you i appreciate the tips guys thanks that was cool well well well that was fun only bf 2042 players understand the reference it is gorgeous isn't it these are abito a bit of this i realized what your name was abito whoa i can see why mom wanted us to bring her here indeed yeah i'm definitely gonna play horizon zero dawn too although i might need to watch a video which is like here's what happened in the first game because i just i haven't got time to play through the whole thing and the main quest is like 30 hours right so i don't know if i've got time to do that so how's he going to get it to work i do not care mr jay mr jay thank you tempted to get this right if you've not played it yeah for sure man it's such a good game is that smoke the face in the mountain me too bro don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes i mean look at this gorgeous back boy take a screenshot what is that we must find another way up the witch wish she was here bet she could get us past this my magic is useless against the black breath and there's no way around it odin saw to that long ago what are you doing here making sure you can finish your job she can fly around why would you warn us i was busy saving my friend if you remember the black breath is a corruption of magic even i can't dispel only the pure light of alfheim is strong enough to break through but that road is long what does this goal mean to you it's everything follow me why help us i see more of myself in you than i'm willing to admit maybe [Music] maybe by helping you i'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes [Music] or maybe i just like you even though we shot your friend even though you shot my friend yes where must we go to a realm beyond your own oh it's so good sleek week thank you for the 10. we're going to another 43 months stage from canada only for a little while damn crazy looking good i can't wait for the actual next-gen games to start coming out like all the unreal engine 5 games because i think a lot of games in the last couple of years even the ones that were on next-gen they've held themselves back a bit because a lot of them have also been on previous gen consoles so when the ue5 games start coming out they're gonna look incredible no one was there when i passed by perhaps he finished dwarves are awfully resourceful and irritating based on the two we have met that [Music] like the demon souls remake that looks next-gen miles morales i think that looks quite next-gen and we've seen trailers of other games that i think look really great like hellblade you know the new hellblade game that looks sick i mean horizon looks sick as well tears temple is at the center of the lake it is from there is the game as well the graphics on that one no longer underwater why is that creature in the bay no one knows he just appeared one day soon after thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms ultimately it ended in a stalemate and thor returned to odin empty-handed the serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of midgard see told you they've hated each other ever since destined to kill each other come ragnarok you believe in ragnarok i really wish i didn't ciao the end of days uh november thank you for the five how's the performance really good kenzie cheers for the 50. your stream has been nothing short of awesome jack i always love your content and your personality videos keep on going with crazy i mean boy thank you kenzie that's very kind when he talks i can't appreciate you being here sadly no one can he speaks a dead tongue the matrix demo as well that look great uh must be lonely yeah this is a very impressive pc version ratchet and clank look great as well watch your step just along here are you sure we came through here before and there's no way that's caught see is that so let me show you something if the rumors are true about last of us remake as well that's probably going to look nuts are you watching what it's solid elven architecture my bowstring was soaked in the light of alfheim it can now reawaken the magic of the elves wait it won't just disappear will it not as long as the light shines free this way i want one those roots what kind of magic is that it's vanir from venom you know of it just stories mother didn't say much about the vanier gods just that they're always at war with the ace here as compared to thor they're the good guys there are no good gods boy thought i taught you that give it a stare down the tongue of nephilheim a foul place of ice and mists and dwarven mischief well this one those runes are of muslim the fire realm no place for children even brave ones can i use ps4 controller i think that works on pc jack yeah here's temple built with help from the giants great tear used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them doesn't seem very peaceful everywhere we go we're attacked especially by dead things the risen dead grow ever more numerous once the roads and trails would have been full of people now all have hid or fled save for the reavers savage enough to survive in such a world a task there the rumors aren't of a another last of us remaster it's already hard at the bottom of these rumors are a remake which is different hey another one of those light crystals wait there while i reawaken the light leosta that did it what are we doing exactly mending the disc repair start by lifting that axle over here yeah remaster typically is just like upgraded textures lighting shadows maybe some fixes some small gameplay changes the remake is making new assets making it look new modern like the demon souls remake final fantasy resident evil what the whole entire bridge is turning how is the whole entire bridge turning boy you're really strong just keep pushing until the bridge reaches it tired yet no he's always been really strong so about the dead we heard someone call them hell walkers but what are they don't fall out four restless souls denied their judgment and their peace why what did then your magic raise the dead it could once but this is no spell this plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance something or someone has meddled with powerful forces that is all i know for sure that's perfect come back up we're ready now that was impressive you didn't hurt your back did you i did not hurt my back i have taken 17 ibuprofens nothing can hurt me anymore through these doors wait so did the giants or the elves build tears stuff all the races helped with its construction it was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before peace disappeared for good do you understand boy you will need ibuprofen hey kevin dude from sri lanka what's up are they making a resident evil 4 remake i don't know i've not heard about that but that would be sick i love re4 it was the best gamecube game or one of them its power is now depleted only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them [Music] your bow please magic once you claim the light of all time infuse the bowstring with its power don't forget upgrade for you boy you're not coming with us i'll try but measures were taken to keep me trapped in midgard why the gods don't care for me much a bit sus to be honest wouldn't you agree boy is this it so dark this temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters it needs only the light of the bifrost to reawaken scary mike's the old republic yeah now that's going to be a really good to look forward to these routes are part of the great world tree and make travel between the realms possible mushrooms would you like some mushrooms how does it work you will need this a bifrost to create travel between realms it can capture hold and transfer the light of alpha place the bifrost there what now give it a moment the temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber it is from this room and this room alone that you will be able to cross between realms what you see before you represents the temple in which we stand as well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside all the realms exist in the same physical space reflections of each other these doors the towers outside and the nine realms are all intertwined and co-existing on the branches of the world tree separated only by the bifrost light of alfheim this place can focus and control that light and is this the world tree only an artistic representation of it no the yggdrasil is much much more than this the tree of life is bound to the fate of the world just as we are bound to it the tree nourishes our soils the dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers the trees very existence supports all of creation along its bounds its life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life birth growth death and rebirth every strand transcending time transcending space everything comes back to the tree so that's how it works but i'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer yes very well the bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of anaheim instead turn the wheel to our actual destination wait is this moving the big bridge outside yes the wheel turns the bridge and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside wait there's no tower on this one and that's why realm travel to ottenheim is impossible without a tower for the bridge to lock into the sequence can't begin every realm has a travel room that unlocks the bridge to that realm i'm giving you the one for alpine now you can lock in your destination we're ready remember to take the bifrost you don't want to lose that now the realm travel bridge will align and the realm between realms will open thank you i didn't understand anything you just said this is all rooted in real norse mythology though isn't it each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the bifrost opening the bridge to that realm that's why realm travel is only possible from this room what about that one round town the jottenheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago when the giants vanished from midgard where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery that's so sick me but my frost is dark this trip was its last use there's no going back until it's replenished with the light of alfheim so we are trapped someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to mkart and we'll be able to make that black breath go away with the captured light of alfheim yes [Music] [Music] welcome to alpheim gentlemen think you can spot the light i can barely see it something's wrong see that column of light on the horizon it's housed in the heart of a ring temple we'll find what we need there no no no no damn it not yet what's happening to restore the bifrost magic you must step into the light but be very careful hmm she's not dead is she not likely um theatrics kratos knows these things look at this place stay by me touch nothing okay what is that a strange plant my boy be careful with it caesar how's the weather in the uk today you know what there's fog everywhere and there's been fog everywhere for the last three days and is there something glowing inside that knot i hate it i think you killed it look up there it's a ghost whoa what's that about not our concern boy focus look here what does it say hmm something about an eternal war for the life i don't get it if both sides need it why not just share it you will find in the common cause for war i like how kratos is as annoyed as we are listen she's just trying to help okay for now they keep murdering the white house it is war the end of one the roped once lost i can't yet uh [Music] [Music] i remember these being really annoying to fight when i played it on playstation what are they attacking us for we didn't do anything more will come [Music] where does this stuff even come from you know how foggy it is okay did you guys ever see john carpenter's the fog i think it's a horror movie from the 70s right and it's essentially a town that's by the sea and then every so often it gets covered in fog and pirates come out of the water and knock on people's doors like three times and they've got fish hooks and if you open the door they got you alive they kill you it's like that amount of fog but that i saw that movie when i was very young like maybe eight years old and it petrified me i was so scared i had so many nightmares about it i don't know why my mom allowed me to watch it but you see it today and it's not even scary but when you're eight years old it's horrifying hello marshall everything's so glowy i feel like i'm a pandora disney world and the compass turns gold and objective is somewhere in the area [Music] wait was that injury frogs careful of the frogs boy oh my god he just smashed the frog think about the frogs oh very well to business i probably shouldn't let my brother lay his hands on it again but if he does tell him to temper his steel longer he's warping the bit work okay 1980 was that movie okay so someone said just don't bother with this for now i'm not going sir oh it's so pretty hey wait for me look the boat's tangled the boat's free you've done the puzzle already god at least let me play the dialogue mr j thank you for becoming a member do i think they'll be able to turn 2042 around or now don't know ebay depends what they decide to do with it i think they just do a year and then move on or they double down and work harder on it really we'll see okay they haven't even said anything yet so i think a lot of them are still on holiday maybe maybe next week we'll get an update did your mother speak of this realm not much oh man the lighting here's just that was fighting over the light it kept them isolated something about the word frog made me want a hot dog with ketchup and onions [Music] a drink from the dew of the world tree brings lasting benefits oh cool do i reach out yeah i do have door i try to keep up with it as well as i can huh again i said nothing where could you hear things what is it boy voices you don't hear that are you nothing hey rudy it's going away now it was screaming lots of voices angry you really didn't hear that no it felt evil [Music] evil is asunder what does it mean boy are you taking too many ibuprofen i told you 17 was the limit you are a god should we try talking to them no but maybe they need help they do not stop us so they do not concern us they do not concern us can i just get out here no i think i have to dock it hello martin from south africa what's up oh man you just noticed so much more detail it's so be the ring nice [Music] look they have symbols and i'll find too what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life's most pure but i don't see any runes around here we must find it back to the boat it's a bit dubious i go through the middle go it's sad the elves can't work things out i'll find such a beautiful place but the blue door that's gotta be the entrance let's go careful boy what are they doing the bridge is gone he covered the crystal with that stuff why to prevent reinforcements oh goodbye uh a way i've got an ability to break the block didn't i i don't have to do it uh [Music] don't need to use my health once either i think it's r2 maybe it's after a parry not sure yeah mosquito is a blooming annoying all these weird things i can hear as well all right so that did something the scale of that is epic [Music] i think it's that one isn't it [Music] we do not belong here [Music] hit the block button twice is that it okay yes it was that wasn't it combined together like that like that yeah thank you it doesn't make sense come back to the sand bowl what's that [Music] it's a boy boy it runs great useful yeah [Music] stories are for the boat we must focus father the pillars in ring farm an elvish room yes they do and i have no idea what it says draw it boy it was the voices again but different voices less angry you're asking for help we are here for the light i do not care who they are nor what they want you never care about anything you have something to say no what's happening whoa look what we found oh that's cool father yes the voices i heard it was hard to make out but
