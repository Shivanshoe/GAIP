here we go tom gun fight you're only against one guy i think his clan tag is pretty fitting for what's about to happen okay is that actually snake shots or is it that's a one-hit kill watch and he's and he's dead oh no no no no will he get a teammate i hope so is it locked no it should uh filter someone in he's gone middle i think [Applause] can hide in this container isn't he oh my god keep up the pressure just hunting down wax on myself [Applause] his teammate's good [Applause] he's gotta be good then i had no chance is that his teammate is that belgium fire yeah well you know what they're like sick pc gamers climb up on the left side here camp here [Applause] what happened i don't know he must have seen my name up in the container i climbed up that barrel there you know you can go in the second floor a bit yeah i just took a random head shot and died hey should i hold here i'm gonna hold here [Applause] see if they come past me i mean they're probably gonna hold team definitely one on my side [Applause] this is fun playing on shipment though yeah i didn't it wasn't a gun confirmed before was it i don't know where dead by me nice one's made one's mid who's in the middle container yeah yeah you watched that video just start spectating you know the flag here objective it's just interesting and this is what the cdk's like in the main game uh yeah i think so i'm watching mid i'm dead oh you're just a beast i don't think about the kill yet no i haven't team game [Applause] oh it's because i've got um i've got more ping jack oh is that why yeah let's get to work what is this foul yeah dude i hate the iron sight on this [Applause] can you two wins down keep up the pressure carry me harder face i'm just going to go afk this way every time i've chose a lane no one's been there and you've killed both on your side it's on yeah i'm gonna hide in this container and let you win the round and in three two one there we go there we go that's what we wanted finally found somewhere this game was so fun man it is it's good it's really good such a simple concept but it works so well mr miyagi rip who's next on the list that's two in a row baby have i even played this i don't know no you wouldn't have this came out whilst cold war was out i don't recognize any of this though from like warzone or mwa no there's a moving tank train on the left eliminate all the enemies or capture the overtime 12 gauge this is the do you remember the oh this was so broken wasn't it yeah yeah another range limit on this thing though should go together yeah i'm gonna right side i've got a pistol as well one far right is that your stun yep it's done through okay once with a pistol got him with the stun oh blasted me point bank there you go he was the last guy other teammates can be on your right [Music] [Applause] i get it olympus your shotgun is pink on your back um it's pink in my hands too mine isn't pink i want a pink one he's low [Applause] oh god i've been stunned oh he's on me okay slide cancel him he's cracked nice oh i just tried to get around that corner got hit by two nades there and they barely like barely escaped the second one they coordinated it thomas weapons really oh no it's your favorite i got this all the lanes i'm gonna hold this left lane looking for an angle one hit kill to the chest didn't it mm-hmm he's pushing mid i think oh look at this there we go 3x is sick for this yeah it works great it's called the vo key okay so isn't it bang yeah feel okay bang [Music] again yeah pushing up a little bit go on peak that game please make my day [Applause] make my day he's there enemy movement pushing oh you're coming oh jesus i just turned around and saw his body like flop on you oh my god we need to play more of this game look at this dominating [Music] [Applause] i'm dead you're dead one dead okay [Applause] keep fighting [Applause] and the animations on the gun was so good did you see the leaked footage of mw2 no oh my god leaked footage yeah there was like 11 seconds of leaked footage it looks sick dude i think one's pushed middle oh got grenades on me nice i almost messed that up yeah there's like an 11 second clip and it's like it's either zone 2 or mw2 but the animations look real good well i've seen descriptions of it apparently warzone 2 is going to have like inventory like pubg yeah strongholds which you go and loot to get your load out yeah he's on that left side okay [Applause] we might as well quit and will the streak end so just retire there's content creators yeah three win streak on gun fights good enough isn't it i'm done bye thank you hanging up the lab coat this social experiment is complete got enough money to buy the fifth golden yacht so yeah might as well retire now hang on i gotta find this footage if it's still about yeah it's like 11 seconds very low quality where did you even see it just on twitter activision started dmca in it all but i'm sure you can find a copy of it somewhere it was absolute potato quality apparently it was recorded in january as well like it's quite old oh wow this is the clip of him like examining an ak or something yeah yeah yeah this is absolutely potato calling what the f why does he stick that mag i don't think he does i think he just puts it on the side and like looks at it where does he stick to my tongue that's what i wouldn't know kind of weapon especially added to this game all right for a reason yeah yeah i'm here jack you ready yeah a cataclysmic mp7 so just one guy again we know exactly where he is it's two okay got teammates in time i'm going high one on my side i'm dead okay teammate in time i don't know what this pink thing is on my profile like why have i got that i'm sure emblem he chose it i think i just got a random all oh my god he had spawn protection at the start there beamed in digital there you go two wins down keep up the pressure i'm on the heels now tom i hit him with every bullet in the magazine but he wouldn't die because he had the spawn protection protect oh no origin 12. golden as well tom oh yeah it's not it's uh time in the limelight in warzone didn't it oh god yes one's pushing middle behind you yeah i always just smash me right on main street oh shh stephen just signed his phone as well where are you looking he was his teammate was in the wooden bit next to me he was in his spawn no that's why he was up there no he wasn't here i'm gonna keep the pistol out yeah it's only for the range makes sense [Applause] [Applause] how will not kill that guy kill one on me i'm going to push the guy you pinged 10 seconds he's in middle he's in mid well played yes where you can ping in this yeah it's cool just seems like it should be more about comms yeah ui yeah gotta go high again right okay anyone's just moved right behind the rock ow where's that there's corn [Applause] i'm having your backs on oh he got me that semtex i think there's two in the treehouse really cool 10 seconds oh yes look at the flick of the wrist oh i spam that jump down man yep what cod is all about definitely make him shoot the weakest parts of your body right in the nuts [Laughter] the hitbox is actually lower damage there what if that was the most hang on i'm dead nice oh hi hi left don't know what i'm shooting at jack nice try just saw the nameplate [Applause] no audio from my gun let's get to work okay bbr [Applause] are you firing at someone there tom yeah yeah it's just in his spawn made in it i hit him with a grenade yeah i know killed downrange the back end is like ruin your first point we're up let's talk about yep i'm pushing right or left left gonna need that wasn't a treehouse your side left oh like actually in it oh no i tried to throw it back you had enough time one time you got this i've seen [Applause] 10 seconds yes clutch it up come on oh no oh close the gap yes go on fairly much in the air there if you had no idea look because i hadn't shot that second shot the gun does that yes it automatically fires too doesn't it yeah the second was shot so i wouldn't have killed him there if it wasn't for that four in a row that was crazy one way to end the match it's not worked well for them that the movie is called kong versus godzilla or godzilla versus kong whatever because when they have the logo of the movie on the splash art or whatever for the for the event it looks like that's what they're gonna what the most gonna have godzilla versus kong but it's just that's the name of the movie it's just got godzilla and kong in it but they don't actually fight each other even though versus is in the title yeah you don't see any of that yeah it's confusing as hell shane this is the lg google proper english world i missed it don't drop the soap i'll push him straight down the middle there flashed him yes [Applause] threw a flashbang you got the calling you flashed him it's all good oh yeah he knows he had no clue look at that the gun flying and spinning out of his arms are so cool remember a little jump spot here jack yeah yeah there's a cheeky little head glitch isn't it they got their pistols out tom oh i nearly died i flashed eggs you got let me see both of them yes oh yes [Applause] tom look at your secondary the ball has to blow oh god you're secondary he's a shotgun oh you're still in the middle yeah it's fine dude if he pushes this that's the emmett it's the m80 oh my god push this it was almost perfectly in sync there oh it was okay i'm gonna peek left insta kill i'm gonna pick right insta kill come on peek it stood i didn't come left oh they both weren't right they both went right the other ones left the game you could do after what he's just been through saw the bolts sticking on your forehead oh my god on his game he saw so much more of me than i saw at him yeah yeah and he saw the nameplate long before he'd actually fully peaked hey max tv1 now though tom yeah he's gonna be too scared to peak isn't he standing right and pushing no time what if we're done i kind of feel abandoned they've only got one guy yeah he's got a bad skin as well no no i don't get doing that that's one of the most highly paid skins oh he's room there he's got teammate oh jesus two wins down keep up the pressure shoot him in the jubilee in the javelin whatever he had on his back no way do we get javelin as a secondary i forgot as well you got the uh in the roof there is the apart from the missioning model there too i'm holding now fires up i'll do it on the right side oh my god it works yeah there's a hole in the ceiling isn't there but it's actually modeled after the one that's in model 30. remember the the version of gunfire they added where you had to loot yeah there's stuff off walls and stuff i hated that i hear him middle somewhere [Applause] yep big guy look at him [Music] season two four four four yeah whenever stadium blew up he's based off a real person isn't he that operator yeah my side oh yeah he got me different guy i think wait okay i wish it would have said that yeah i mean it does but it's like the most faint thing in the bottom left oh he shot the vital organ in your foot let's go chop my little toe look at this scope i don't like that tom kind of clean how did that miss i didn't i'm just shocked to shoot oh this one doesn't have an explosive on it does it i thank you to hit that take a break there's just like no footsteps in this game unless there's full sprint i'm just gonna peak right and hope for the best hope he walks into it dead oh my god did he actually walk into it i saw him when i shot how is that not here he stopped right [Applause] get out of here [Laughter] no way oh this camera looks horrible and look this is going to be rng dude oh yeah completely well played no i went for the second throw knife because i picked up off him he's on the stairs left i'm gonna throw a knife really you've actually probably got more like with a thorough knife than you have the jump shot throwing knife you got another one i won't that's a perfect thumbnail holy that was good i'm going left my side damn it these deagles suck dude [Applause] hiding somewhere here yeah oh yes star what a throne that's what we wanted you're really good with those knives it's like they throw pretty quick don't they so oh my god that was like the uh we hit general shepard yeah it's the same thing isn't it you get him in the eye yeah [Applause] i'm pushing right oh no i need to do the full reload middle bridge hi i'm gonna push this not the full reload yeah what's that shake it up focus on the next round did we have a secondary what's my back there that's just my axe pistol okay bear trap pistol i'm gonna hang back a little bit i thought we had the 150 mag so just mag dumped on the left side all right kill me right side with the pistol should be a good prank nice there it is that was beautiful on to the next round well cognate as well there it is right move oh no what is this that should be all right i'm going to push mid and hide [Applause] oh it's this the sr rounds jack he's your side we killed each other we actually traded that counts match point it must be rare to trade kill when the bullets are so close right in the left nut yeah i mean these rounds do i guess they'll probably do a lot of damage in one play i'm pushing right stairs hiding left oh my god what frag he just threw i was a decoy [Applause] one's up there as well tom i think you kill him you're one yeah no idea where he is he's on the right staircase here pushing up a little bit my side oh he smashed him in the face what's this oh you know you were there oh don't need no aim assist the radical physics is so good in this that was better it's more of a close game yeah it was what's that five in a row that's five that is five sp this could be very campy this map if you wanted to i'm holding left oh i just peeled this gap back oh i'm on fire uh mid-right that first kill was dirty what do you mean you peeled his skin off i peeled his scalp off let's get this done he says that i don't know it's weird your head shot him yeah okay i'll just scalp after peel this scalpel it's weird not being able to strafe when you're mounted feels odd oh no i was killed on that left side far left one it's all up to you now the squad's counting on you probably gonna push you on the right good like i just hit him once in the leg and he died do you want me to help oh for hp i thought he said was i in full hd then 40 voip 4k one's pushing mid or over yeah in the middle through over oh yeah kill the [ __ ] now's gonna kill me where's his mate right side spawn yeah this is much easier than last time yeah this map just suits us yeah i don't like this side no it's horrible just been shot from the right there right dead [Applause] should be good molly missed you got him yeah i'll play five rounds down one more we got the win keep shooting people in the ball you love it tom yeah unless every a knife and it's always the eye you love the right eye oh it's the obsidian camo look i can only dream of uh sweating so hard to get this and you know there's a sweaty camera to get as well just been killed on the right side it's all up to you now the squad's counting on you did you push nah he was in a a concrete ball blockade you're next to he was on his version of it on the other side my lethal is not great okay you timed out just to be where it was 10 seconds long is it good if you have directly instant kill where's the fight should be off to the right i'll be in the middle here in a sec secure that objective yes six zero they keep the bass like will they ever regen to full no i think that's what it is i think you don't regen yeah because they're just dying to like a single hp unless you've got a sim yeah like your screen goes back to full clarity but the player's health isn't actually a full i don't see a defeat inside i don't see how we could lose we played gunfight until we lost 13 hour videos secondary is a car 98 oh hell yeah switching open i just heard you say hell yeah switching muffin oh yeah switching wep weapon i said have you like just traded the blueberry muffin for a strawberry thing yeah okay that's fine [Applause] i don't know how i was missing there i mean i'm using iron sights but wait where the hell have i spawned oh man we're getting ruined how what is this con i ate build ass they're very passive players these oh goodness oh goodness what we're looking for jack someone get some aloe vera for that burn we need those clips oh no it's got like a stubby barrel on it oh the a12 with the drum mag 32 rounder so overkill for gunfight [Applause] yeah the other guy basically the same keeps going to that mid point though how are you playing against people like this okay we need to get it together something how far away we are from each other [Applause] come on he's so low game let me have this oh my god he's hitting me alright with the frag i'm dead [Applause] i'm dead yes jack [Applause] shotgun isn't it how is he playing as a cold war no prisoners yeah good point let's be honest they won and they're spawning and he hits he gets the one hit because i i didn't have the spawn protection that's pain has he already pushed i don't know maybe she's holding the wall on his spawn when he when i died can't turn this laser off i don't see your laser 10 seconds oh unlucky you can get on top stand you can fight up yeah it's only the green laser you see from a third person perspective the red one you don't all right i'm going to use the cell like visible to enemies not visible to enemies but this is the penalty i'm dead yes he's on the right is he i don't know you're an absolute beast keep pushing i don't want to lose this game no that sound dude we won't jack got 12 more hours of this out of us [Applause] on the right same position as the guy that you just killed [Music] 10 seconds oh my he hasn't made a single sound wait you haven't either there you go easy you want in this now i don't understand yeah maybe that's adler isn't it yeah looks like him oh i just lost some hp there i'm in a bad spot here son i'm just low kill on you good cover thank you man one's on me leaving it he's pretty low on the left side now nade was basically on him don't know how you didn't kill him yes this is the blackout rounds they aren't they yeah [Applause] one more for the win tom let's go just breathing into his mic that's when you know you're playing cod [Applause] not a word was uttered but breath got a nice head glitch here center is the burst or single fire hollow point ump or whatever it is dude where is he i don't know i heard him he's slimy thanks oh boy you know i thought we might lose that one time we pulled it but eliminate all enemies or capture the overtime flames no we're playing against the punisher oh no frank castle himself [Laughter] doesn't matter that it's a 2v1 he's going to beat us anyway i think what's this appealer look at this stinger i don't think this one kills enemies is it free fire in this one there's two now oh it's a free firearm rocket i'm gonna go for a rocket kill because why not yeah are they gone high you can go high in this time yeah you can okay oh nice kill em both the second one didn't spawn all right [Applause] i just killed the punisher it was that simple wearing the um the may skin fan again finnigan [Applause] oh someone's trying to get up oh i just saw him after the flash faded nice try [Applause] what you got for me toms oh no that's the luckiest shot he's over here no no tom literally the luckiest head shot oh i tried to line it oh god damn it it's frank [Laughter] and wall hacks beam through a pub in daredevil this he destroys the irish gangsters doesn't he oh no yeah yeah you know frank castle's actually lit he's good i think he might lose this what's up oh he's very vengeful after his family was killed give me a good gun damn it yeah it's just it's not been a good weapon selection so far the film was all right i'm just gonna push the thing with the peeler though is mental i don't see layers remember there's one a pie sure yeah there's another pie and these are on me i'm dead okay he's there he's above me just kill me there you go i think it was easy to see the map and they appear on the mini map right i don't think there is even a min there's no mini map isn't it oh yeah there isn't yeah it's really minimal hud i like it it's good i'm gonna go higher again yeah with you actually i'm gonna go under here they're camping at this point both of them understand [Applause] oh bro he cooked that nade and own me oh wow look at this guy he cooked it perfectly i was trying to get behind a container but i guess i did push out give me an assault rifle all right let's get in there that's not an assault rifle um garrett i had glitches where's this gun the ump one's high above me here i see you don't see dead nice you're better than him [Applause] i second know frank castle he's in his spawn pretty low right side yes oh my god that was close dude i would have left him on however low health it can be [Applause] does it follow this thing yeah [Applause] i'm [Applause] i don't know mate he went prone i see him he's here there you go two wins down keep up the pressure they can't take the aggression time that's what it is well we haven't this is probably the best game we've had so far for aggression give them a proper english score hello and shotgun run around ranks okay they love going on the top there don't they i've seen that right now but i thought it's gonna happen yeah moving [Applause] are you still there mm-hmm nice i have to get the headshot said yeah i i ran up top for the bird's eye view absolutely beat me switching sides came with a few shots but it's really dusty where the uh they've almost died over there hard to see there's someone standing on that part of the map [Applause] i'm dead oh he's lit he's absolutely lit tom you got this looking for him back right yeah right there right there go go go go go yes oh and in style come on what a game actually thought we were going to lose that one okay last game win or lose show them what we do i will not kill this guy this guy's lowe's all here this guy's between us joe i think i don't see him oh he died that was guys fighting what killed me with a sword knife he did the jump his throw knife you did punish him [Applause] so cinematic and laggy wow so cinematic and laggy hang on tommy you're a cobra operator now oh maybe it's a glitch then no because i'm playing as uh am i still mara you are you get crossfired then i did yeah [Applause] i think he jumped over my knife so he jumped around it oh yeah i'm stunned i'm playing a stud yeah you are playing a stud but you've got random characters no no i've got the uh the guy that got added with the zombies event [Applause] i got the cleo mask on he thinks he can jump beat me and just hold mouse one time hit your stem if you get damaged yeah i'm gonna die jack so enough time to do that where my skull is directly we sat in a container there not like this yeah right there with the vanish ten seconds [Applause] the rat you see that yeah there's rats i'll win though because yeah he would have won the last thing he saw was a wrap that was a mechanic how bad is that [Applause] nice oh what's up on top of the van on top of the van still gonna be stood there why why would you not win now keep up the pressure i mean he's got the the enrollment skin for completing the training for warzone pro game of thumb shotgun crossbow [Applause] you think there's any drop at this distance he was the last man standing okay same thing just happened to me around with my guns i should have just kept the shotgun out dude yeah that's what i did i kind of rushed for the shotty but it's pink i just got jump shotted no footsteps whatsoever see if they rush on a pie here one down low where my body is yes shut his hand off oh beauty imagine being killed by a pink shotgun move to engage all bye guys wearing a tamagotchi watch one on the left he's rushing i think yeah on my body [Applause]
