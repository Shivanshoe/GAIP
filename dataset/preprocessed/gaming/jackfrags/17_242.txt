hi everyone hope you're well today i've got a bit of bad news dice and battlefield just announced that battlefield 2042 has been delayed now it's only been delayed by about a month but obviously if you were someone like myself who was looking forward to getting their hands on the game in october it's a bit of a disappointment of course but we'll take a look at the statement now so it says that we've made the decision to shift the launch of battlefield 2042 the game will now be released worldwide on november 19 2021 building the next generation of battlefield during a global pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for our development teams given the scale and scope of the game we had hoped our teams would be back in our studios together as we move towards launch with the ongoing conditions not allowing that to happen safely and with all the hard work the teams are doing from home we feel it's important to take the extra time to deliver on the vision of battlefield 2042 for our players your enthusiasm for the game has been very inspiring we believe in the game that we're making and we thank you for your patience as we put some finishing touches into the experience updates on the open beta will be coming later this month and that's it so it looks like ea and the four development teams on this game have decided it needs a little bit more time in the oven and they've delayed it by a month it was supposed to be october 22nd but now it's going to be november 19th which actually puts it after call of duty vanguard which is quite interesting now as i mentioned at the start i am kind of sad about this because it is another month before the game is fully released but i'm sure as many other people would say they'd prefer that the game worked than having it rushed out a month early i certainly feel that way anyway i'd rather that it was a better product overall and maybe the developers of people making this game could do that in a way that they weren't stressed or overworked or as the industry calls it in crunch mode as for the beta though they said updates coming later this month well i don't know this for sure but i wouldn't be surprised if we still get the beta this month usually beta builds are different branches of the game that have been put together well in advance so unless dice decide that they want to make a more updated version of the beta it could be that we'll still play it this month we're halfway through september now so if it is coming this month it's got to be soon and i'd expect that we'd have updates about it if we don't get any updates about it anything official perhaps they're going to push the open beta back into october we don't know yet but that's all just a little update for you guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below how do you feel about this one if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
