[Music] hi everyone and welcome to call of duty warzone season one huge update came out today including a new map called rebirth and they've also added 30 weapons 30 from cold war a bit overwhelming to be honest with you i wanted to jump in now play a few games experience the map for the first time and just use some of these new weapons i mean it's crazy these are all black ops weapons assault rifles smgs shotguns lmgs attack rifles that's a whole new category isn't it they didn't have that before marksman rifles snipers i'm not sure if there's any melee weapons but i'm really overwhelmed by this i just i don't know what to use i don't know what's good i don't know what's bad obviously i've used these guns in cold war but they've got completely different stats in warzone completely different stats the recoil will be different the damage the velocity so all new metas will form but i've gone for the ubz and the mac 10. i've been looking at social media today everyone says that the mac 10 absolutely shreds so we're going to use that uh playing with westy today as well and we'll be getting a random fill for the third unfortunately you can only play in trios at the moment a new map it's an interesting game mode where you can respawn but they did say that quads would be available but that's coming down the line i think so we can't play quads tonight but maybe they'll add that tomorrow uh also of course there's a new battle pass load of new stuff in here uh i unlocked everything earlier i just bought all the tiers i had like 40 passes or something like that so i did i get a lot of free ones well that sounds really annoying isn't it and they've added a load of stuff to the store as well all sorts of operators and blueprints uh i saw this one this adler skin looks like a cowboy i thought i'd get that one i will use that skin got some minted revolvers there also if you do buy the battle pass or pick up anything in the store you can add my supporter creator code here which is jack frags in capital letters that's just a nice way to help support me if you fancy doing that other content creators are involved in that too with that said i think we're ready to play this is going to be confusing but let's see how it goes all right cam you ready i am ready let's do this man let's go you've played this map quite a bit today then yeah i was playing with um with stard tommo and and lackey earlier they were rotating in and out during the day um it's a bit chaotic it's like it's chaos is it basically um i i would probably say that the map is no bigger than promenade from verdansk that's probably about as big as the entire map down by where the big ferris wheel is yeah yeah like i said from there and then it you know uh promenade goes sort of up towards train station right so and then it sort of stopped that's probably about as big as the entire map okay so it's pretty condensed and i i thought initially when they said um that there was only like 45 players per match i was like that's way too low it's definitely not it's it's not what it is at the moment it's 45 and i think that's just purely because of of trio so that's the number that it goes to okay i think i think they're going to do quads probably later this week or something so i would i'd assume that maybe the number will go up just slightly to make sure they can fit in a round number of squads but kind of disappointed they didn't do quads first actually i thought that would have been better it's very yellow and orange isn't it it's the kind of modern warfare-ish looking isn't it yeah it looks very yellow that's my first impression yeah it's got like a weird color filter on it it's it's all right you get used to it i think there's less dark spots on this map there are dark areas but there's like you know they get those spots on the dance mat where you can literally just sit there as a rose skin and be like haha no one can see me [Applause] yeah there's less there's a little bit less of that here right like the the lighting feels like it's a little bit better plus you'll probably notice this with your pc the performance is actually quite a bit better on this map too i've got 220 240 yes yeah i'm using the 3080 so mine's like 190 to 200 at 1440p okay so that's pretty decent so this is what the map looks like from above now it's tidy isn't it it's fine it's very small um we've been dropping a lot around this actually it's right out of the zone this bio weapons lab building it's actually quite a good one because there's not too much to to think about but we probably want to be in the zone i guess so where do you want to drop uh well we've got to choose pretty quick uh how about here nova 6 factory let's go and you drop really fast as well but it feels like the the drop animation is like really quick but they fix something with it yeah yeah you hit the ground really fast you do indeed [Music] what's that siren about i don't know i i heard it i think it's just a signal that like that like the rounds starting and i think it starts again when um every time like the zone comes in okay i think there was someone behind me there might have been the phil oh this is the perfect uav let's do this there we go oh this guy out here you want to go over that dude you never know he's on our level he's on our level oh right here he's on that he's on the corner hello i was being shot in the back yeah here over there on orange marker yeah i've gone away there you you go all right oh by the way uh loadout drops on this map uh seven thousand five hundred not ten grand oh they're half price uh twenty five percent off twenty five percent off that's why it's not quite half price isn't it i'm good at maths mate [Applause] is that why we became youtubers yeah i think so i'm not at math i'm not account not accountants i would be a terrible accountant me too i mean he's got a colorful sniper rifle on his back that's going to give us away oh that's the uh the tundra right from cold war there's a guy right here yeah he's down on the ground there he is nice oh i killed someone here oh we should get in the cable car dude yeah it's literally above you it's above you right now it's going up here hostile maneuvering you use it yeah you can if you come over here you can get in the cable car and then you can get this origin now okay coming yeah it will come back down of its own accord you have to be careful because like there's no protection and there's no feel stupid even saying it's like we're gonna get killed so that just takes you up to the main roof there yeah take shots in the main roof at least our at least our film knows what's up oh oh god we're gonna go up there and there's gonna be people up there this is a good idea oh no it's definitely a bad idea i don't think it's a good idea at all cameron no no no no no right i've got a thermite that could help us he's on the roof oh he's right no no all right okay so you guys have to survive for 20 seconds and i'll automatically respawn oh really that's interesting yeah so so you can see that if you die right now then we all die but if you wait for 10 if you don't die for 10 seconds [Applause] now i'm back and the timer um goes down quicker if you kill people so your friends will come back faster no way okay there's a guy in here by the way in that building oh he's in there yeah okay i'm coming over as i ran towards that squad he just went i knocked one and killed him and then he went to his mate it's horrible and then i killed his mate there's literally a guy in here right xm4 or famous i think it's in four or five the loadout's coming really quick there oh footsteps on the stairs lovely lovely oh there's one more there's a guy oh my god and then he ran through he ran through the door and he was hiding behind the door oh god well this is a real dizzy no jack's alive jax hello okay so i'm just going to stay in here and hide for a bit you know like i'm i'm coming back now i think i hear that yeah let me it out hi where was he right there in the building ah okay the red mark oh no there's a gap here so you're you don't need to buy us back i'm just going to respond in 20 seconds i just have to survive but unfortunately i've not survived but our friend has our friend has survived so if he can stay alive he's got 10 seconds okay no he's done it he's done it if he kills people the timer goes down quicker and so now that you're alive if he dies it doesn't matter because you're alive right and then it's like in other modes though it sort of like stops after a while there's a guy in the building here so just be careful yeah i'm just gonna oh what are you doing there oh my god the max 10 really does rip yeah it does there's a guy up on the stairs yeah yeah see if i can mark him for you there he is nice well done oh i'm being shot at oh god dude this is so chaotic what the hell it's kind of mental isn't it that's the pellets in there isn't it out here oh god i'm gonna die again there's two people like parachuting in above the green building this is absolute chaos dude can i get up to you uh my our our friend might be able to get right we have to get to try and get up to you cam so i think they're destroyed he's he's coming he's coming there's a guy on the roof right above us oh my god yeah i got my load down now we're good well i got bullets that's about it this is this is exciting you know playing on a new map yeah i definitely i just i think that i think people wanted the bigger map but maybe they're just not done with it yet upstairs upstairs oh yeah he's just told us that upstairs i just opened this door so i didn't play the alcatraz map in blackout so this is completely new to me is it worth going to that um buying and getting some armor maybe yeah probably oh guy coming upstairs he's down wavy david what the hell no no no no you're dying you're dying just meleed him i've got no bullets man cluster strike lovely so have i actually uh should we get bounty i think we should get some cool fire sale by the way that happens like every round okay there's all two things yeah everything's just super cheap super quick snappy fast everything's happening i think there's a guy above me yeah this is coming out towards you this is i'm going to look i think they're going to be goodbye they're upstairs in the building above you they must be i'm on the outside of the building on that little gangway that we were on earlier yeah i just heartbeated 27 meters there's only one guy on the heartbeat i can hear multiple footsteps yeah yeah he's on the back he's just gone in here come down here yeah i'm good i don't know why i decided to fire a shotgun at me from that range what stupid move that was nice lovely oh there's another guy uh behind me oh he shot me from the way back don't come around that corner i'm gonna try and get out of here yeah i would how do you get how do you get out of here dude where are you you like stuck in there i feel like i'm stuck down here there should be a way out oh there we go there's a guy there sighting in don't forget zone's coming now he's respawned you should be able to get him you've got that cluster if you need it 20 seconds and i'll be back i think at the end of this circle there's no more respawning so you have to like buy people back if there's a buy in the zone or you know just leave it but people just keep parachuting in all the time dude [Music] [Applause] are you gonna come back one second yeah one second and i'm back yeah i'm coming back there's there is a guy above this building uh yeah i see him i see him there there he is marked him hi mark can i mark him again can i mark him again i got [Applause] oh i spawned with a fennec beautiful not something at least man i feel like a bambi in the woods or something i'm so lost in this building can you please disregard oh this is a secret door here didn't they figure out the code for that earlier geeky pastimes and those guys i didn't even know there was a door here i played this one playing this map for seven hours and i'm not even realizing there's a door there secret bunker nice oh god he's dug him in a fight i'm gonna put a cluster there when we move bringing down an airstrike yeah yeah what's that instant airstrike what the hell looked like it looks like there's two going in there's no there's two going in there's two airstrikes right now that's sick both you and him called one in right zone is moving i'm worried about this maybe there's a precision air strike going in over there dropping down let's just try and sit together and then trade frags we need to yes yes yes assist elimination someone just rest here come really yeah i just had the right we're right in the circle we're right in it yeah i don't like this this is really weird like literally all the cover we've got are these tiny little buildings oh trophy system went down somewhere i think in this building i just put trophy in here yeah he did taking enemy traps right there look where the zones were oh i got me i did throw a grenade in it's all on you there oh it's all on jack oh god i'm screwed just run you can make it there's a guy there what i believe in you jack that's the last guy that's the last guy he's going to sell for us yeah i think this is well that's not bad for a first game is it that's all right that was nice i think did you hit him with the sentence yeah i think i said something oh nice dude nice well there we go we just completed the rebirth island there yeah that the engine is it not allowed to play it anymore that was fun to sell dude it's sorry it's just you're on edge constantly you've got to be like watching about six different angles all right very well played very well i'm played to pull us off before the abuse [Applause] [Laughter] was all right wasn't he he was good i'll be one sec i'll queue us back up okay i'm gonna pick a different weapon that's a good first

ak-74u bangs yeah maybe i should try that bit of an smg assault rifle hybrid in it now's a good time to warm up yeah it's a really small map isn't it guys groza is overpowered i wish i could change my loadout here that'd be sick uh gavin thank you for the two m16 or al will be the new meta vulgar thanks for the five seasons of greens from pittsburgh david thank you so much we've got a couple new members as well blue gols richie donald flips his dad nuka-cola thank you guys appreciate you being here hopefully we can uh put together some entertainment for you look at this stupid all right i'm back welcome back right just in time indeed just in time [Music] okay why do you want to drop this time she'll drop over the other side the map oh man um where were we we went by we went over nova sip nova six factory we were all right yeah so we go over there let's go buy our weapons yeah oh yeah the helicopters have guns i know yes it's uh kind of mental yeah yeah we got mics oh god this is a bad drop cam oh god i don't know where to go just drop down low at lowest level lowest level oh i'm not there sorry it's all good it's all good i have i've played most of the there's a guy in this building [Applause] what's up uh that's a rafika shotgun's mad it's about what have you got yeah it's messed up do we just kind of like wait on a load like this guys oh i'm just going to mute you in the pie yeah no worries uh mute yeah twice i saw uh basically i think you can kind of wait for your loadout i i found it's good to like have a building for the first bit and then just try and defend it from other people oh well that's the spouse and is [Applause] i don't think so there was another guy on the minimap over here on orange he was in the building but okay i'm gonna buy some plates we could get a loadout can we oh my goodness me look at how many people are in this build in this building in front of us on the roof he just dropped on the roof yeah you don't drop me you cash uh cam and i can get a load oh yeah you can you've got enough haven't you i'll drop it by the bike they're pushing behind us they're pushing behind us [Applause] the last guy i think he's self-raising jack this guy yeah nice well done one more here oh there's another one i'm coming back in now jack he's he's like in the other side of the room yeah yeah i'm gonna come in watch out watch out he's gonna hear you i'm upstairs yeah i don't see him at all this door's been open though downstairs [Music] someone's just dropped in again yeah i hear footsteps on yours i think over this way yeah he's here nice job finished coming in oh there's shots coming from the top of that roof over there this guy had his loadout already custom milano thank you very much i'll take that [Applause] i hate it when luke does that it gets slightly stuck in a wall and you can't pick it up anymore [Applause] oh nice he's on the stairs the same guy nice you get another one nice dude well played [Applause] oh there's another one where is he where is it in the door over here [Applause] [Applause] that was kind of mental so that's what's out there no respawning uh yeah no respawn on that one yeah that was crazy man i mean what that was nuts that's worse than the uh zombies mode yeah that's honestly like it's like a horse it's like a horde mode but the horde have guns every one of them has guns oh dude but i tell you what though it's part of war zone that like i really enjoy i like the gunfights like it's action-packed constantly which is why i like um when they did mini royale a few seasons ago yeah i um i really liked that because you got your loadout really quick and you could just get into the action have some gunfights you can get back into games really quick as well so they didn't they didn't know if they do stiff did they no they didn't nerf the duff duff that's a shame isn't it they did remove the juggernaut um from normal mode so there's no more juggernaut rewards for those easter eggs anymore okay well at least that's something right oh we didn't get a third oh will it fill us not anymore it won't yeah yeah sleeve then because i feel like you kind yeah you do need that third person yeah phil was on we just didn't we just didn't get one i forgot to mention as well guys if you do use my code in the store for anything um tweet you a picture i'm keeping a big record of everyone that uses it and uh putting it in videos for a shout out oh hello hello i saw jacko's message i wasn't sure if you still needed a third do you want to play son yeah i'll do a couple of rounds yeah jump in we'll get him in what's your impressions of this map stud i i didn't like it at first um i think i think it there's way too many angles and pathways to be picked from right if it feels like it's weird because it's supposed to be like a really close quarters like linear map but it doesn't feel like that at all it feels like the most open and um you can basically shot from anywhere at all times you just feel i just you just don't feel safe at all i don't know if that's a good thing our first game was a bit chaotic like like most of the time you just get shot in the back you ready to play now stud yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll see you online secrets there he is there he is there's the online stock hey yeah it works for cold war as well for milk they just implemented that today i'm for the lw3 yeah yeah if you get anything it helps going with the peli yeah the best i think you think the peninsula is the best new gun out of all of them uh best new sniper yeah because the other ones don't really do anything i mean the pelington is basically the spr like they're almost identical guns but they they perform quite differently um but the thing is the problem is with the attachments we just don't have like you're never going to want to use the cold war snipers over the warzone no there's ones no way well yeah maybe the penalty but even the pennington if we actually get the stats i reckon it won't even be as good as the car 98. get yourself interested like i think i think the you know it's got decent aim down side speed decent bullet velocity but does it even beat the car 98 i don't know [Applause] the helicopters have got mini guns on the side all of them do even in the dance as well it's a bit of a delay isn't there no why do we we used it earlier it's terrible yeah like the the the guns don't quite seem to fire where you think they're going to fire but there's no splash damage on it no but there's no normal helis anymore all helis have gunners on them now on the main map as well right yeah i will try at the groza uh later on i i just didn't get a chance to use the uh the other two then actually get my loadout freeze load so slowly yeah it's another thing like you have to get the fast mags basically that's what it's telling you to do get the fast mag where's tilted towers uh what is uh i guess nova six factories always meant on there yeah and over six is pretty mental and we we tried to drop by our weapons last round but we got stuck in uh decon zone and it was just like literally just enemies pouring in through the windows [Music] i don't know where to go man do chemical engineering it's another like three-story building so plenty of hot action to be had yeah there's loads of people on the roof i'm stuck i'm stoked got one you guys got guns uh i got an smg oh i've got a girl's ass nice that's a good gun it grows as good is it uh yeah it's pretty decent what's that for me oh yeah they'll just keep coming me [Applause] that abs is really fast well rpd yeah lmg yeah yeah i did that last game for a little bit yeah it's got good ideas that much better than the uh modern warfare fms you can get ammo [Applause] yeah why not do you think they should make this map [Applause] kilo on i know you know make it more interesting cxd you got an rc xd awesome yeah let's see if i can use it deployed oh hello all right can you ride it oh on the roof taking shots he's come on you're up well done i tried it won't go up the stairs the door's closed it's very because it's not an outflow you've got a new place done oh you open the door open it up this [Applause] this is this is very uh responsive this mp5 is not it's not the one for range is it no guys i can't get i can't get him through the door there we go i'm through if you get killed with this car and it'd be great yeah it's not gonna happen like this has definitely been built to be driven with a controller like absolutely it doesn't work when that's the keyboard no it's that like as soon as you hit uh a or d it's like oh you want to do 90 degree turn straight into a wall okay that's not how it works i did just get a hit marker though so maybe it blew up and it yeah on the roof he did so much damage to me when i dropped down there he's he's not got plates a guy above gaba [Applause] they do have spawn protection in the sky really anymore yeah they do yeah not really when they when they when they cut their shoe for the first time they don't they immediately lose it right here guy here literally right here down because he was right in front of it jack he's just around the side of the uh on the round the side of the order that's a nice outfit you got me where the hell everybody we should make a b-line for that yolo oh god i have plates oh god i hate this so much guys can we go i want to go oh god i need to grab this guy's plates have you found the new crates yet jack new crates jack jack yeah there's their rebirth crates they're um they're red oh yeah i've seen a couple of them you can open them multiple times are you showing me stud this is this is a little secret roof to this uh building it's under the ground yeah it's an underground secret route all right it does feel quite cold doesn't it also these ones keep coming back yeah you can they'll just keep opening yeah those crates is that bugs or is that intentional no no intention no that's those are the crates you can open multiple times right now we should have bought some wait shouldn't we yeah maybe [Applause] this round and the um the craig oh yeah m4 is a little sad the old xm4 yeah it's not certainly not for range and i can work i thought we might run into it he didn't [Applause] i mean i could just buy an airstrike i need a wi-fi they're sniping us from red roof [Applause] close-knit and then you have these big open spaces a new skull get that bouncy get that bouncy oh oh [Music] hang on is there is there a trophy 37 meters there's a guy in front of me oh yeah you definitely want to be meters you definitely want babe on the roof everyone is like so useful in this map because everyone can just hide cameron you're crazy yep you just rest i'm coming up if i can help you sniper yeah down him again down him again over there on the red mark stun grenada [Applause] [Music] i love it on the roof [Applause] he's right above me got me he got there you know he's gone back down the zip line he's going back down the zip thing what the hell i'm coming out of zone [Applause] [Applause] so you can't control that little cable car it just goes up and down by itself yeah correct we have a brilliant position right now down one on the end building nice oh i can't i can't drop the oh it's a killstreak i didn't realize the rcx was a kill streak you oh someone just ran through my mind in this building oh this creek is not very accurate rage have you got a suppressor on it yeah that reduces the damage range on that gun all right it reduces and it reduces the bullet velocity as well it's not like the suppressors from modern warfare so don't put suppressors on cold war weapons no basically and then you're on the mini map 24 7. [Applause] i'm dropping off i could probably buy a self-raise or something snipers looking at me [Applause] i love how no one takes the chopper because it seems those miniguns are really really bad sniper looking straight at me from the building yeah i do i can give you one six 36. down one in the building that guy that was looking at us from the window over here quite open here all right we've got one in each building one team in each building oh this guy down here all the flinch the flinch man that was insane over here on blue right yeah that was literally like eighty percent yeah no guys they're also looking at us from the building directly to our southeast [Applause] sorry it's good that's good without plates though he's right here he's looking at jack's body yeah i don't i don't have plates at all that's fine this one if i can kill you get one of that at the end real quick i just was not excited there's a guy there oh no oh you're gonna cough if you go there what's he doing i think i'm dead boys oh wait wait oh he's holding you he's holding you let's go he's gone hello you've got your r60 as well remember oh no nice start one played oh no two seconds on uh cameron respond as well oh wait give me a response yeah i had no idea yeah yeah there was still a reason i didn't realize you had three spawn yeah sorry guys i had no i actually had no idea i should have stayed in the gas that's fine don't worry about it yeah this is quite competitive like there's lots of good players there yes this will suit some people and not a lot of others that's my my analysis i just realized that i we only got three seconds off because they're down so i would have had to survive five seconds but i think i could have done if i just stayed in the gas right and then and then we would have had to just yolo down to the bottom to the roof can i yes i had a self-rest so i don't know if because i had a self-res it allowed me to get back i don't know i'm not 100 sure how it works my timer had stopped but cameron's was still counting down weird interesting no i don't i don't think you come back rusty i think you're done because the other it doesn't make sense otherwise if it said disabled the cameras definitely had a countdown then maybe it's just bugged yeah i'm pretty sure it still counts down even if even if the thing's disabled i've had that we've heard that yeah because um yeah in the literally we've all died and then we were sitting in the spectator cam and the counter was still coming down right okay so i must hear you maybe it might have been broken brass nooks thank you for becoming a member that's very kind here man yeah i think it was bugged there this is so much more fun than the dance what's him it's definitely a lot more action-packed which monitor i'm playing on the hbo next 27 today a pro gamer over here [Applause] the timer was bugged now three gigs and you're jumping in yeah it's quite a big download again wasn't it for [Applause] did this say why are you cheating [Laughter] [Applause] lorne have you guys played this on cod mobile no i have not you've done warming up standby for deployment how similar it is was this actually on called mobile yeah this map is on cod mobile i don't know if it's the same like exact same though i'm not sure i feel like on mobile that would be a bit like trying to scroll your thumb around all the corners check every angle to be a bit mental yeah the you have to check eight angles in every window you enter enter the window battle royale but i don't want to mark a drop point no no i can't do it i don't think i will i like how that bombing run opens up uh throughout the route apparently you land on you didn't tell us where you going it's definitely this building is quite good that we're in now hello you win your first three fights let's go the new mp5 you win everything i think it's going to replace the mp5 at the um yeah anything it doesn't have is a suppressor but i guess it doesn't matter if you put a suppressor on it because you just hit fire okay there's the one cold war gun that might actually be usable oh there you go if you want to yes yeah there's like some gas over here it's gone now you guess you take a rennies you're going in this building and kill them i mean it's it's just yeah there's a guy on our level here no no he was slightly above that's the problem so many footsteps go together watch out for the shotgun it's all right i've got the map ten they know we're in there oh yeah 100 they know we're here up here he's up here right here unless he's on the roof maybe he's right above us [Applause] [Applause] jack [Applause] killed them all no no no no no because he i kept on baiting to see if we were supposed to be didn't he had full plates as well the running mechanics changed no my stuff but they haven't still the same so [Music] they died around but my god all sorts of experiments going on here what the hell there's not a pellington inside guys feeling a little bit [Applause] not again so much fun oh i need ammo hey y'all i have some ammo i can give you please daddy here you go jack oh i fell off oh i couldn't even hear all my parachute either daddy what happened there you go i'm glad that was live stream to like 20 000 people that looked absolutely fantastic you just looking up at me me walking off the edge of the building like cracking my legs it's all scripted don't worry all right when do i go on the ten kill three two next round next round there's a vehicle that just pulled up to those loadouts and then it drove away again oh oh my okay i should not have gone that way dude this is just the dude like mounted in the window no oh yeah i see him oh that's the easiest kill do we go for a loading right i think there's hang on a minute give it five give it five seconds yeah don't die for five seconds i'm dead there were so many loadouts there what the hell oh they got a minigun oh they're beaming they're beaming broke [Applause] they're not happy about that oh come on cracked him right coming over why would you get in that helicopter it's a death sentence on this map it really is the other map i could totally understand yeah direct two on scotto no i got the guy down in there there's another one in it i think he's resting him down he's got i think he's gone gone back down in it oh this reminds me of the matrix so uh [Applause] nice oh he's low he's so low solo gotta play nice one good cover thank god this is insane like this is just mental if you want to level up your guns though pretty good way of doing it isn't it there's people who blow me there's a sniper in that building looking at us watch out oh man i need uh i need armor again screwed yeah looking for that there might be armor down here a legend stop yeah right there was a guy peeking at some orange jack yeah there was one in this oh let me just mark that these are cell blocks there you go he's literally hiding from top window right hand sides it's like game whack em all this which window are they gonna peek next he's still picking why is he why is he in your eye why would he keep peeking so stupid oh no there are three teams left but the tundra yeah it's not it's i'm not enjoying it not like the fellaini did no not at all hellington's great the pelington's really fun you know oh someone here with it with an m13 and a doof of course they've got to have their fun jack just let him have it groundly pelington's actually nuts as well really really good yeah very good very good they're still in orange i think so new clients oh god i think you could i don't think you can only parachute oh he's there in the window hello is he peeking yeah he was this is going to be deja vu back window back window yeah this is awful it's the same as last time god this this position sucks jack i hate it let's run do we run down the hill in here down the hill down the hill and far away because then they have to come to us anyway and now we and now we get the position i guess although we're lower in the hill lower of the hill that guy's shooting in it's in the gas oh i don't know what that guy is they're on the level so they're just on here somewhere moving here just one in this window here on green you go on the tower i mean they're all gonna have to come out of this window here it's mine no hi there one on this window down yeah i'm down i'm down yeah i should be able to get because he shot you through that window you can't see my head one one up one we've got down we've got shop there's this one on the edge back where we were just sniping he's sniping i broke one down low i don't see these guys it's fine they're they're they're all just gonna go to the galaxy unless they come around this side moving position oh we're about to where we were now our team's in the safe zone we could get to that by quick you want to get some uh yeah yeah drop in my cash if you need it because you cash why are you running fast i've got a precision air strike maybe it will come in handy i'm gonna buy a uav hit one uh anyone wants to stop his deck [Applause] still sniping [Applause] one last one yeah one more time [Applause] i think they actually played it smart because they knew we had to come over this ledge yeah that was good good place you don't get any time to relax on this map here like you say you gotta have your head on a swivel ggs let me go back to the menu because i want to make a new load up yeah sure thank you it's odds yeah i should probably go in for [Music] max then it's just so good it is insane ffar not bad decent yeah that's good really good ffa is good that is a good and all my next unlock for the ffar is a reinforced heavy barrel extra damage range extra bullet velocity but then they're all the same they all have the same attachments after that so once you know what the meta is for one cold war gun you know for all them right yes okay i'm good good to go good thank you there you go the pelington it's such a good gun like it's got such a good feeling to it yeah it's a really good way of leveling up this hamza is there no solo mode on this no not the moment there's only trios and you can't play the normal vr on this map yet which i was looking forward to uh campbell thank you for the five hope you're doing well during the lockdown i'm doing good my man thanks as good as we can be bret thank you for the five what do you want for christmas oh man i don't want anything for christmas i just can't wait till things get back to normal you know that's all honestly i want to see my family but i

this map 45 45 on this map let's get another win do it got another win then boys yeah listen i fancy another one you figure out if these stats count towards your main stats or are they separate uh i'm not actually sure should uh jamie no you can't use the cold war weapons in on a wolf yep oh you can get up in the lighthouse as well yeah yeah there's uh you can get up in the tower and everything wow like a sniper's nest up there that's cool [Music] right where are we going don't drop security area have a bit of fun down here yeah i don't think i'm not we've not been there have we come uh you finished the very first game down there you barely went you barely went into it so and it's it's actually probably one of the least vertical areas of the map that's just like it's quite flat down there okay you do drop very quick out of that plane don't you yeah there's no there's like no delay you're just like off we go just meet you out [Applause] thank you i killed his squad he killed me nice there you guys thought there you go i don't know what language it was blue i think maybe it was uh spanish so do you need more plates i've got a few uh one more yeah all right all of the guy i

tap on the tower hang on a minute oh he was saying the whole time yeah because they they keep reporting remember what oh i see [Applause] hey going down oh my god he went through the roof then seven seconds through the roof two one nice this is insane this is absolutely yeah we're being shot from further off as well is that an orange crate there oh no it wasn't i don't think you're gonna land in the water really i've got zero ammo guys cut this parachute coming in [Applause] missed the final shot yeah these guys hate us by the way they absolutely hate us and we hate them as well [Applause] [Applause] okay hold on uh i'm gonna res there's not a sniper dodge you killed a simp for the car 98 ah no never let it down oh yeah please thank you moving position enemy uav overhead it's matt i like the other match no one in the lighthouse at the moment what's the point uh i've seen a couple of people meme around them but [Applause] uh i don't know you guys have swear places yeah let me guess our loadout is in guam whoa yeah it is [Applause] no it's not too far actually it's just at the bottom of a hill which kind of sucks i see the loadout i see the [Applause] to get ghost what else

it's insane have you got a mag for it uh 25 i don't yeah so right was it is that the moment that's the minute no there's a there's a 38 round that comes up not too long after they're all over here they're all over at number six you don't feel like this but it feels like it's linux kind of yes same right fire isn't it it was maybe higher damage yeah oh right in front of me right in front of me on orange i mean it bounces around so much though you still there's lights and ammo and everything everywhere yo v again look at that that's the whole that's what that's the whole server some of them just dropped off yep oh no oh no no we go down um [Applause] that one finished that was a team [Applause] that's all right there's a guy down below precision air strike asteroid guys struck that's right i didn't get that warning oh god well be careful oh my god it went right over you guys hit the roof and [Applause] he's down and dead nice one and that's the last team he was just last team can still get in their lives there you go right we need to find them before they res them again they've got a ghost uh yeah they've got ghosts oh no he hasn't got ghosts he's literally he's about here he's about here below below you get down he went down the gap yeah he went down the gap it still only says there's five yeah maybe it's 19.44 jack's just literally working his way through that building i'm coming home i'm scared now it's four it's four or five levels deep that building oh god 36 meters yeah enemy soldier oh behind behind couldn't hit him is that a distraction is it could be just go kill him gonna be in this i mean you can but it's the foot but it's the full team inning they're all back oh well we're but they're what two of them are still in that building yeah uavs uavs desperately that was gonna win yes okay can you come and spend your money yes he just said what the he was peaking that quarter with the right they can't mix them with his forehead now they physically cannot run now the only way they can is that there's a buy down here there is a buy oh he's on the roof he's on the roof around my side he's going to be me hold on i don't think he's going to drop yeah that's right he broke his broken feet he's on that roof nice yes my aim wasn't great but lovely lads what is this this is so much fun no it's chaos but it is fun oh yeah that's what you're banking on fun i feel like you can't camp as much well you can it's just people to know where you are all the time it's uh it's an interesting one it's definitely a different pace of game that far mass is kind of useless apart from anything that's mid like it has to be really short range yeah yeah it's basically maybe out to about 30 meters anything longer than that the recoil's too erratic well played play again oh risky uh hold up new loadouts let's go right what should i try now um have you tried the stoner yet nope that's an lmg isn't it level nine i've got nothing for this that's good control i don't even have that well over a red dot 120 rounds you crush i'll be one sec i shall just relaunch my game and then i'll invite you back in once you've done your loadouts roger that 2x on the m16 oh baby rapid fire barrel okay why not rapid fire what's that laser sight on the m16 oh nice why can i not take that off i don't know i'm just going to go with that why does it say sasha on the back as well who's sasha maybe it's an easter egg the only sasha i know is the one from team fortress 2 it's the heavy's minigun isn't it i'm just fetching online profile and i will be in fetching the store info yeah i just got some dynamite on his thigh bull baby dynamite thighs oh he's ready to go uh okay what is happening to my game what's up tyler top poggers 10k viewers yeah got lots of people tuning in tonight lots and lots of doggers stone is a very light gmpg squad also wonder how it is in this apparently it's pretty good the boys were telling me rapid pupils why not battlefields just in a war zone tonight battlefield is not i mean there's not much going on is there really charlie thanks for the two dirk thank you for becoming a new member what's up tyler and fortnight three clips hi jack i've been watching you for ages now the videos have really helped me through tough times your voice and videos are so not true all i'm not sure what that means but we're going to go with that and i love watching the bars of your streams thank you for now clips thank you so much man is it natasha who touched natasha is it i thought it was sasha oh that said uh it's one of them right hey callum what's up i can't believe they didn't know if the dude what are they doing scrap papa what's up semi hey dj the gamer do you even doof do not tonight that's three wins in the bag boys in uh an hour and ten minutes or so it's not bad is it i was just saying yeah actually there's uh there's a section to the stats for resurgence this mode uh that traction wins oh it's separate so it's in like under where you go to like war zone wins or whatever there's a separate section there's now one for mini royale and there's one for resurgence okay let's see real wins not real win the only real wins are in normal pr mode now we take all win but the thing is mini royale like they only added that section that like after the third time they added it in as a game mode so there's at least 30 wins in mini royale that have not been tracked for me i'm very disappointed oh yeah mini roy out was good yogis didn't count either did it no it didn't oh god no or zombies zombies didn't count either and zombies basically took over the game now what was the word though mini mini royale should have been half a win 100 the point five of a win yeah mini royale was really really really competitive as well yes it was only because when you dropped in it was literally like half a minute after you dropped you'd get your loadout right you crashed all right soldier mark uh buy a weapon oh no do you know what i think decon zone is the quietest [Applause] it's been the quietest it's a pretty good drop not gonna lie not many people go here because i think it's so low down people are like oh there's not that much loot and actually there's loads all right okay [Music] hey ellington oh it's not wellington [Applause] [Applause] there's a couple down there um okay oh yeah i got absolutely wrecked by that guy you gotta stay alive and second i think i can do it you can do it start i believe in you i'm on the outside okay are the new cold war shotguns any good way just awful well they nerfed this past 12 in the update the other day he hasn't got plates give me a gun give me a gun there's a guy literally just up here literally just on the top the roof now he's just [Applause] i think you might be all

on from uh what's her face lots of doggers moved on from her lots of doggers and she was a great summer meme you crush he's all year round a poor guy i think he's i think he's just confused like he's

awesome thank you hey tj what's up cooper why can't i play rebirth island on pc philip you should be able to you need to load warzone though not cold war and it's just right there in the main menu

oh no god mode others lots of doggers lots of doggers all right where are we going um we could go we could go decon zone again if you are that's gonna be hot though because it's this side of the circle isn't it uh nova factory yeah it's so cinematic but it is i feel like they could put extra work into that stuff because the map's so small this probably took quite a lot of time to like properly make though there's more coming here shut the door oh god i'm screwed i'm screwed are you decision yeah yeah i'm screwed oh god he's down here at the docks i'm trying to get my selfies off i

m92 i'm sorry [Applause] oh my god this is so much chaos it's insane go back to normal wars though it's going to be like there's no one to fight did you play any of the the base map earlier you did didn't you i did yeah we played we played a couple of rounds we realized that this is this is probably the way for a little bit the um if you want quick gameplays i saw a clip of uh i think it's over by airport it's like an underground bunker did you go there uh no but i know they added a button because people in my comment section on my video today were saying did you go and check it out and apparently there's like a new key card for it or something well you don't i watched the video of it on twitter and you don't need a key card there's like a big open part of the ground and you just go down and there's a cylinder and then there's just a bunker that's already open so you can get loads of like orange boxes in there so you don't have to do a an easter egg or anything it sounds like a pretty hot drop yeah no juggies in there yes yay thank god they're gone who asked for them just keep them in juggie royale could you imagine this rebirth island with juggies well that'd be crazy and zombies imagine zombies zombies well do you think it will because there's season two is gonna be a new zombies map oh really uh you never know they are really smashing out of the park aren't they content-wise i mean i've had fun definitely yeah yeah well do you see yourself playing this map in a week ah nah it's too stressful you know when you've got sbm as well like every match if there was an spm i'd be on it 24 7. but tomorrow back to normal royale with the pen yeah i'd probably just go after you mad when the tundra sounds cool it's so slow it's just it's just a worse worst person even worse it doesn't do anything but [Applause] it's got the black ops animation zone i'm not a particular fan of that all right that's enough everything's so deliberate yeah don't like that it feels very uh we had to use an old engine doesn't it [Music] right here we go let's see if we can rebirth ourselves hey that's gross i've given birth to myself again five times in one match uh is it decon yes
