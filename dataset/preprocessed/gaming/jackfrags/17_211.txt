battlefield have just dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some new weapons vehicles and also three maps that we haven't really had a good look at before there's some great stuff in here it is quite a short trailer but there's a fair bit to unpack so let's get stuck in the trailer starts off on renewal this is a map set in egypt and as you can see there is a giant wall that divides the level down the middle on one side we've got lush green vegetation and on the other it's an arid desert wasteland a stark contrast there and obviously in the lore of bf 2042 it's something that's worth fighting for and then we switch to some gameplay and this is irish puts down the deployable shield there uses it as cover takes out a couple players and begins to push forward with their squad looks very battlefield this shot doesn't it perfect for a trailer it seems as if there's plenty of detail in the foliage here too and then we move on it appears that the player has gone on top of one of the buildings we could see in the background there fighting against a little bird they drop down and take out three players indoors as they're being supported by dozer here with shield the weapon here is the pkp we've seen that in art before but never in first person a couple of mods on there by the looks of it and also look at that secondary down there kind of looks like a machine pistol so maybe a secondary that they've modified with a full grip and turned it into full automatic be interesting if you could do that if you look at the ui as well it's a bit different to the first clip we just looked at and i think that this is the most up-to-date version of the ui because we've got the compass permanently on the screen and the enemy killed messages have now moved to the center i think that looks way better so i'm happy with that then we move on to the next map breakaway this looks absolutely insane from a gameplay perspective but also just graphically so impressive here and all that stuff in the background you can see that's all playable i said that this is the biggest map in the game at launch and it clocks in at approximately 5.9 kilometers squared that's about the same size as the vacanty map from pubg to give you an idea of just how massive this is and then we switch to a gameplay clip of sundance using the wingsuit effectively here dropping down picking up a kill with the dm7 looks like so much fun that and if you look down here there's chunks of snow here just randomly crumbling and falling off this massive ice so it seems like there will be some cool weather and environmental effects on this level some of them you may not even notice i just hope that the penguins are there from their reveal trailer because if they're not there will be consequences then we switch to the pov of a mckay as they're making their way up a zip line here holding what looks like an ak with a drum mag we didn't see that on the plus system in the beta zipping up towards that oil rig and the size of that that looks like it could be a level on its own we don't know if you can go inside it or not but just a massive piece of geometry there to fight over the scale of this level is just ridiculous and then finally on to discarded this is saying india and you'll be fighting over shipping containers and a massive cargo ship in the middle which acts as a key position of power and then we go boots on the ground with dozer here using the 12m auto shotgun just chunking through people there brand new gun we've not seen that before and also that vehicle that drove past i think that's a brand new civilian vehicle the civilian vehicle on orbital the open beta map look like an electric pickup but this is quite different 4x4 maybe it seats more people a bit more durable perhaps and then that helicopter comes in picks them up very nice terrain detail and reflections on this map with those puddles of water graphically i'd say that this looks like the most detailed map that we've seen so far for 2042 and i think the guns here from the little bird they've either been buffed or they're a different version of the ones that we had in the open beta because this looks like they've got way more splash damage on and are doing more damage so could be a modification there for that helicopter and unfortunately that's it it was quite a short trailer but awesome to see some gameplay on additional maps that haven't been seen before outside of little snippets here and there cinematics i'd still love to see some unedited lengthy gameplay before launch though and yes we're yet to see any real hazard zone gameplay or some kind of deep dive into portal coming soon i hope so with that said that's all for today folks do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music]
