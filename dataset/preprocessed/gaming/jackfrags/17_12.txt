if you've seen the title of the video and you want to just see the weapon build for the fastest smg in the game which is kind of insane right now the marco and i'm going to put it on the screen now the movement speed with this is absolutely nuts you can sprint while firing as well with that build and for whatever reason the taped grip they buff the hell out of it and it increases your movement speed and you just zoom across the map so it builds there if you want to copy it but if you want to stay for some lovely gameplay then please strap in and take a seat i have to admit that i am really enjoying the new warzone map i think it's great the outplay opportunities the flags that you can do escaping you've even got some sniping opportunities too which you'll see in this video now i'm kind of sad about this because i played about seven or eight matches today and earlier this morning my windows didn't update and it completely changed all my audio devices and i didn't check them on obs which is what i used to record and it just recorded the gameplay so it didn't actually record my microphone or the discord chat because i was playing with a couple of mates here and we were having a laugh of course doing some tactics that kind of stuff so we're gonna talk over it and take a look at this new smg and why it's so damn good this thing is gonna be enough pretty soon apparently the new lng is tasty as well although i've not really played with that at all i tried a blueprint of it but the recall was terrible however i've seen some clips on twitter of people who have maxed out the lmg and fitted it out with the correct attachments it looks ridiculous of course whenever there's a new gun you know they wanted to fit into the game and maybe their testing hasn't quite got things right or they've missed something here and there and ends up just being a bit broken for the game now this smg again with this build you can sprint and fire at the same time and the tape grip allows you to move super fast so you can get in all sorts of fire fights and squirrel your way around the map taking people out disengaging healing up re-engaging reloading getting back in a fight throwing a snapshot grenade and that kind of gameplay really seems to suit this map this situation here i'm not sure how i made it out alive so i'll get a down on that player there's another enemy who just comes out of nowhere i popped the daddy you know maybe i wouldn't have escaped there if i didn't have the daddy because they would have heard the footsteps but i ran away from the fight played it up jumped back onto the roof and i was just really hungry for kills in this game i'm already on a 15 so i wasn't really sticking near my team which is kind of bad but i feel like if you want to hunt for frags this is the map to do it long range down there with the smg you can kind of compete at range and i knew this guy was going to sell fresh and i just pre-fired the semtex there it gets them cheeky team wipe didn't have a self-rest but thankfully stodd came back and got me the revive i kind of wish though that this map had a few more squads in it in quads it's 40 players and i reckon a few more squads would go a long way here because some of the matches actually end up finishing really early when the circle's big even though it's resurgence if you've got a couple of demon players in the lobby then they can quickly churn through all the teams and the players and get the job finished so a couple more squads would be nice and here we were just searching for the last player and tommo who was on my team was like jack come up here come up here get the kill get the 20 bomb so i came up and just got absolutely wrecked by that player we were just cracking up at the time tomorrow res is me i get down instantly straight away because the guy peaked and then tomorrow just went you know what screw this because stod's gone down we could have lost that you know they started pushing but that's the victory there and it was just a really fun match you know just utilizing that smg as well as i could slip sliding around just having a blast with warzone to be honest i really didn't think this map would do that much for me but it's got me back into it again and there's been a lot of good quality of life fixes too not just in this update but over the last few so it's in a pretty decent place right now and i think that it's a good time to come back and give it a shot if you haven't played for a while maybe get some mates together try at the new map and see what you think now this is another match we played today with a bit of sniping you know we hit some nice hdr shots there tommo jumped off the cliff and he said that the reason he did that was to try and get me out the tower because i was just sat there sniping for so long but here's a good example of how would this smg you can escape even when you're on the back foot like that player had completely removed my armor they had me bang to right but because of the movement speed i was just able to get away dead quick and this is a kill here which demonstrates the sprinting and firing at the same time being able to chase people down and just hit fire you know i put a mouse and keyboard so i don't have that aim assist but i think if you're a good player on controller the sprinting and firing thing is going to be so much better for you so you know this isn't like what optimum gameplay with this gun can look like it's another content creator from the uk called benny central he's been in a couple of my videos before i think in battlefield in the past and also warzone you know when it started out we did a few squad ups together he got a 41 kill solo quads world record earlier today using this gun with the nz even though the nz is supposed to have been nerfed it's still really strong but the smg of course was this just running around like an absolute mad lad and he plays on controller on pc and if you go and watch his video he's just posted it you can see how good this is with controller on pc with aim assist the movement is just ridiculous with it i'll make sure to link it down below actually so you guys can just click on it and watch it if you want but now that game's over we switched up to caldera this is the new version of the map with the 50 less vegetation most of the water's dried up they've added a ton of new pois they've added storage town as well that's where we were fighting at the start there you may have recognized it from the dansk and i wanted to put this game in because it's got some longer range engagements in it and using the smg again to its full advantage also some pretty dirty snipes in here too nice little grenade there i mean there's a lot of look involved with that to be honest i just knew there was someone up there because i think westie had called it out but back in storage town here i could hear someone on the other side of the garage and we just saw a little flicker of them there and they took out a stone i'm seeing more stuns today not that i'm a big fan of that and i went for the chase just feeling confident get up onto that roof get the kill and then we'll move on to the next i think stud was calling for help here there's an enemy down there without serpentine park i'm noticing that a bit more and it's definitely saved a couple of people that i've been shooting at so it does is it 20 less damage if they're running away or sprinting at the time but it's not damage to armor it's just health damage and i reckon that's why people don't really pick it maybe they've changed it in this patch i'm not sure go up here on the hangar take him out straight away with that hdr the hdr is still my favorite sniper although the three line my squad was saying that that's pretty decent i don't know what was happening here this guy jumped in the plane tried to take off and i'd done enough damage that i got kill credit when they crashed into a building there look very cinematic indeed i rejoined the squad over here and they called out there was a guy behind the car here so just using the marco movement stay on target and then we also knew that there was a dude in the little building here you can hear the footsteps running around there they are they run past me again not a problem for this gun i'm really liking it but as i mentioned it will be nerfed i don't know if it's just the movement speed that will take nerf maybe i don't feel like the damage is much of a problem to be honest this guy came leaping out the building the other way so in the zone here trying to keep up my ammo trying to keep up my plates i got the notification that someone was dropping in and it was just a random player behind the rocks there luckily i had another gulag token so i've been in once already as you saw i'm looking around for this guy trying to find him and i wanted to grenade the middle i thought that would get the kill i think the grenade hit them and then they ran away then i get rushed behind little jump flick and got lucky hit him in the head back in the game got my loot back and we were just chasing the last few players here guy down here snapshots need to go in my opinion i'm gonna use them whilst they're in the game i think the recharge time on them should be a lot longer they just adjusted it to 30 seconds and they reduced the radius a bit but they're so strong especially with restock but it is what it is while they're there keep using them and this is the last guy here downswesty but we got the take down and that's all she wrote for this match nice little game again on caldera this time so that's the new smg it's really strong hopefully i've demonstrated today exactly how strong it is that build incredible max it out give it a shot let me know what you think and that's going to do it for warzone today i do want to say i did mention this in the stream yesterday just a big thank you to everyone that's tuning in to my content the last couple months or so have been really good in terms of variety and views and comments and engagement sentiment watch time is really high click-through rate's really good and i'm just very appreciative of you guys tuning in supporting me and watching my stuff you know i'm really enjoying this making content at the moment i'm trying to implement as much narrative into it as i can but every now and again just a bit of gameplay for you i know some people do like to just see some gameplay commentary from time to time and that's all guys if you buy anything in the cod store as well a little plug at the end here do consider using my code jack frags tweet me a pic if you do as well like all these people have bang the code in before you get the battle pass or blueprints and if you do that and buy something i'll get a bit of kickback just another way to help support me right i'm off if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe if you're new i'll see you next time bye
