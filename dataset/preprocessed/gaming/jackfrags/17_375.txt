i'm so glad that i went back a few months ago and decided to load up the f1 again as this game has quickly become the chill-out game for me where i can just jump on play a few rounds i don't really care what happens it's pretty chill i don't have to try too hard and i can have a laugh that's what this game is now and it's just fun it's pure fun and i wanted to distress a bit today about a really busy weekend busy day today all sorts of stuff going on in the uh the industry at the moment plenty of events and whatnot things to do things to see so i thought you know bf1 might be a good game for tonight hang on right here i'm using the martini henry today just because it's so awesome you know oh god i can't take that fight there was like four people there yeah the martini it's uh just epic girl i haven't used it in ages and it's still a one-hit kill up to like why is it 40 meters i don't remember the stats exactly but it's a really really fun gun to use and it's been a while for me i can't believe i just beat that medic longer reload time of course but if you hit the shot totally worth it oh god they're going to push me aren't they you're an enemy i just ran into that guy oh my god is that a squad mate he's on fire stick the needle in me come on do it legend oh my god oh my god okay i'm instantly dead again it's fine it happens i'll tell you what though one thing that was really good i know it's different for different countries and wherever you are in the world but in the uk we've been in lockdown really on and off since like i don't know march last year and what the hell where are the shots going that's better see that was 100 damage so we've been we've been in lockdown since like march and then things opened up again when was it june july maybe for a couple months and then the carving numbers went way back up again and then they put us in lockdown again so we've been all over the shop really but everything's been closed no non-essential shops restaurants that kind of thing you can get takeouts but you have been able to get takeouts but you know you weren't allowed to eat at a restaurant go to the hairdressers go to the gym know leisure stuff was open but at the start of last week i think it was they actually allowed the restaurants to open up again but only for outdoor dining right so at the weekend went for a meal and it was awesome so nice to just be able to get a meal at a restaurant some nice food some drink and just have that experience again it's such a little thing really but obviously i think this lockdown has uh it's certainly made me appreciate the things that we take for granted you know the everyday things that we can just go out and do whenever we want but when something like a global pandemic happens well you're kind of screwed aren't you i'm sure a guy ran past here there we go i did put two little mines down maybe the fact that those mines were there meant that he didn't expect me or someone back there i can't see them though because i like smoke see i expect that to be a one-hit kill there that kind of range i don't know but yeah it was just like i'm not going to get soppy or anything but it was nice to be able to go out for a meal again it's been like eight months yeah i think it's been about eight months for me oh airbus moore forgot those things were in the game they suck they absolutely suck there was a bit of warzone news today as well they released a blog post showing all the stuff that's coming in season three well they didn't really say much about the new map i was like shall i make a warzone video like an update video and then i thought you know what the next few days are going to be so jam-packed with war zone content anyway that i'll leave it and we'll do some battlefield today so we've got the events coming up for warzone nuke events zombie events whatever they're going to be new map so over the next few days i'll be streaming a lot of warzone because i want to experience those events live and with you guys you know but that's what we'll be doing when those events are live i'll be streaming them i'd love to stream more battlefield unfortunately i can't like i play on pc i have talked about this before but that guy's dead if i stream battlefield i just get stream sniped and um hackers follow me onto every server i did leave those streams up so you guys can go and watch them back if you want proof but every time i tried to stream on youtube that happened and that was bf4 bf3 bf1 and bf5 now unfortunately you know that it's very easy for people to get cheats for those games here and i would you know they just target me so i can't stream much battlefield at the moment in the future if that changes and the next game has a decent anti-cheat i'm going to be streaming the hell out about our field on youtube that's something i really haven't been able to do yet so i'm looking forward to it man oh these kills are racking up now i'm getting used to that martini again but you see what i mean though about this game being so chill can i get that support player so many servers as well like if you've if you've not played battlefield 1 give it a go look at this medic just in my face dude please i was just looking at the server browser and it was uh very full lots of players and i'm on pc here too and i guess on console there'll be a lot more enemies this is i was a sniper over there oh that's 100 damage that's the range ah that's got to be right on the edge though surely i'm gonna go down here i think unless uh we made it yeah it's on uh is it ea ea play it's called now the thing that used to be called ea access or origin access and that's part of the xbox game pass as well so i imagine it is quite popular on console 2 especially xbox on pc there's always a ton of servers it was my only option you've got to try and melee them if you get in front behind it's a one-hit kill there's a medic nearby stick me medic yeah get in quick reload oh there's one in the building as well in the little window there didn't even see that guy he's wearing the rose skin use this for your dressing patch yourself up i could have done the voice acting for this game it's a joke by the way oh i know there was more down there on the right back in these trenches again ready i don't want to go for that gas whoa is that the pilot there that plane crash was all the planes still going here it's gone now these boats as well i put a cable in them you reckon i can can i snipe one of the guys on it oh it's been killed i destroy i got it i think i see a little reek on there did you see that he's peeking out right there one more hit oh he's he's gone someone else killed him i thought my first shot was a head shot obviously not oh come on dice where's that gun there's a shock trooper that's better there's a shock trooper it's kind of cool today we're called shock troopers oh yes lube that one into his face there's a flamer kit here i feel like it'll be kind of useless on this mountain i'll get it anyway whatever could get that back rage the epic backrage here we go have we got time i mean there's a lot of enemies here they in range i think they're in range i've got the old fire retardant suit on don't i so it's not going to do any damage to me yeah we're cooking with the barbecue in our lads the bbq is here never fear chef franks is here today i am an enemy just just ran straight towards me like i was nothing hello yes oh no oh that was an awesome kill streak with that and dice put that in the perfect position there didn't they right where i needed it in that trench unfortunately we are going to lose this one but you know what it was good fun we had fun it's bf1 it's a good laugh i'll drop the gj in the chat dj well played i love it
