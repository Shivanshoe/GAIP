um hello everyone and welcome back to more cyberpunk 2077 so today we are continuing the main story the campaign and last night when i stopped playing when i stopped streaming i did a few side quests upgraded a few things and i've got some new weapons that are quite meaty i've got this double barrel shotgun that destroys people [Music] i've got this smg that sets people on fire not bad and i've also got myself a dirty sniper rifle that you can charge up and shoot and if you hit most people in the head it will take them down in like one or two bullets so we are fully equipped i've also got some new hacking abilities too and we'll be experimenting with those today i've enjoyed the first six hours of the game we've encountered a few bugs along the way but i think the story is quite interesting and now that we're starting to get some more upgrades and different weapons i'm a lot more invested in it as you can see we're looking good here today's stream today's video is sponsored by nvidia a big thanks to them and we are playing the game today on an rtx 3090 graphics card on ultra settings and we've got ray tracing turned on with some really nice reflections shadows ambient occlusion game looks great we've also using dlss which is nvidia's 2.0 version of this it's ai super sampling so your games can look good and run at better frame rates really cool technology and it's in all sorts of games so with that said on my agenda i've gotta call mr hans because we're about to go meet the voodoo boys i think we've got three main quest arcs that we can choose here and i thought that we would go do the voodoo boys one first because we haven't been to pacifica and that's a new district i suppose of the game that we've not seen so that's going to be quite interesting i'm causing a bit of a traffic jam i got a new car as well look at this bad boy i mean it's no porsche but it'll do apparently there is a porsche in the game you can get where there's smoke right let's give him a call then see what he has to say so i'm gonna get my phone with t and the game's crashed this is exactly what happened yesterday exactly the same thing oh it does crash a lot oh my god okay don't worry we'll deal with it we'll load it up again hopefully cyberpunk can address this and actually stop these crashes from happening because i've got the latest drivers i've got the latest version of the game and it does crash quite a lot it's a shame because i love the gameplay exactly the same thing happened yesterday we crashed right at the start then we didn't crash again oh man good memes good memes have to pay respects boys f to pay respects right okay i'm gonna call the dude right now mr hands call are you going to say for yourself miss dance hey what's shaking i need to make contact with the voodoo boy's chief if you can swing it all right all right straight to heavy business now priests and whatnot all got dirigible-sized egos won't talk to lowly me but if you insist i could ask around try to set something up i'll just need some details first got something they want truly want to sell something to the bdbs trust me they don't want it they don't need it they're isolated insulated they got their own contracts tech networks but have it your way okay i'll see what i can do and get back to you sounds good the suit are the leads until mr hands calls back all right so we can't go see the voodoo boys then we can't do that yet i don't know i'm not sure could meet with uh sakamura instead track that one where is he on the map he's all the way up there i think that's tracked isn't it yeah all right let's get in my car in my mom's car [Music] i do miss jackie he was a cool guy doesn't afraid of anything thank you for coming along to the stream if you're watching this as a video what's up i hope you enjoy it hello tank hampshire gaming what's up happy shanks welcome great to see you guys here we had a lot of viewers yesterday in the day before that on release lots of hot topics and discussions about this game i just hope that we don't crash again i really don't want to crash again nice please save me [Music] oh oh can we just keep going this way anyway no i need to go up that ramp don't i [Music] watch out i'm gonna dude around here as you can see i am a very skilled driver in this game i never crash into anything everything works exactly as you would expect it to and it's fine you just want me to eat myself off the side here i mean what's consider this your lucky day oh you hear pacifica and you make sweet love to it oh okay got something for me he's got something well it's like i said whatever you're peddling the vtbs are just not in the market but they have another task that needs doing so i volunteered you do it well it's crashed again oh okay this is not a good start is it this is not a good start oh man we'll stick through we'll stick through it come on i might change some of the settings because i wonder if it's a particular setting that i've got on that's making it crash i'm very sorry about this guys um sometimes it just it just do be like this you know it does it it just is like this with live streams let's have a look there might be something in the settings i mean these are the settings that i've been playing with for the last couple days i haven't really changed anything so i don't know why it's uh suddenly crashing loads it was fine last night when i was playing second crash within the first 10 minutes but on medium about on performance [Music] put a couple of these on high motion blur leave that that's fine let's go with that fingers crossed fingers crossed so we know that mr anz is going to call us back pretty soon anyway right so i guess i should just run around and just see if it crashes again that's a nice pink car is that the same person twins maybe [Music] i could try turning the motion blur off maybe that's what's causing it try that the nvidia update had issues is that true spinal yeah i don't think there was an update between yesterday and today maybe there was just [ __ ] off please terrorist attack i'm a [ __ ] like you wow dude why is it overheating what the hell i need to change the title from insane graphics to near insane graphics yeah that's the one you got it i mean it does look great though doesn't it like the detail i was watching digital foundry they did a breakdown of all the uh the graphic settings in the game and there's so much tech going on here like look how vibrant and detailed this is it's great when it doesn't crash though yeah i am streaming in 4k as well so if you've got a device and a connection that's good enough to watch that you select that setting because it it looks really good in 4k they were hacking me oh that's what it is no i'm gonna get my own car back where is it car i like how you can just call them get in it seems stable at the moment [Music] there we go consider this your lucky day you hear pacifica and you make sweet love to it that is got something for me well it's like i said whatever you're peddling the vtbs are just not in the market but they have another task that needs doing so i volunteered you

yeah i've got an nvme ssd i'm not trying the car again that's over no way really appreciate it if you didn't make this difficult yeah garage in the back but quietly yeah anything interesting happen over there since we are here all quiet no one in no one out well they went out for supplies once [Music] walk the line dude there's a ferris wheel and everything i'm gonna save the game because i'm i'm scared i'm scared that it's gonna crash again the crash is like the final boss of the game it's like i'm playing dark souls but just crashes yeah how do i defeat the crash no one knows whoa i've got super speed this isn't hostile is it [ __ ] ah do i have to oh it is hostile don't make me go far along i'm sorry dude i didn't realize it was hostile [Music] okay well okay here we go i guess all right so this is the fire smg i was talking about it just ruins people okay okay okay okay looks like we're going loud then and the sniper rifle should be one shot kill look at that that's all i need [Music] who needs stealth anyway right oh look at these bikes it's cool you got the balls hey i'll show myself with a grenade suck on that yeah i'm gonna pee now i'm glad that i did those side missions right find the van in the lobby that's bearing it wasn't so scared of it crashing again is it a quick save it is quicksave avoid it even work say this place is abandoned years ago now it is not animals fixed here uh turn it off the size of that dude it's huge purple i love that love this yes counter strike got to go upstairs what's up retro splash thank you very much man [Music] f5 yeah f5 is the the mvp oh man i haven't been to a mall in about 12 months because of the c virus ping reboot optics so she's gonna like go blind any second and she's just fine with that apparently lady [Music] oh my god i mean it's too late for that isn't it what the i've drawn plenty of attention is this [ __ ] serious there's fire everywhere now sorry i do have that sniper though oh check this out this is the new double barrel excuse me how strong that is i'm sorry now ah it's more fun to fight anyway just destroy them i don't even know where i got this it's just like a a shiny pink shotgun i kind of like it [Music] i hack that turret distract enemies turn off yeah like i said i did learn a few new hacking abilities as well nice animations you compare this to when i started the game how many bullets people were taking it makes a big difference to the combat i think the further you get through the game you level up you just threw a flashbang at me get you better guns ow it knocks them back too so you get a bit of a breather blows that off i've got a couple of guns that can shoot round corners as well so go downstairs maybe i feel like i should just pick everyone off first yo can't you see what's been going down dude i think it's for the best that they all die anyway right you know what you don't want these guys knocking around causing you trouble coming back in a week after they've recovered is that an explosive barrel there yeah all right we're gonna drop down yeah let's go hey there oh good night they're all dead we literally killed everyone i mean that's good experience right that's really good combat experience right there and uh it gives you guys watching the stream a good idea of what the combat's like in the game okay save f5 is the bit f5 is the key just keep pressing f5 f5 f5 there's the van it's hoover simulator this game is all i do is run around like gobbling everything i just hammer it over everything up reminds me of fallout no we're jacking in well i got you here mine tell me what we're looking at data flow map of pacifica they hunt aguero who is they netwatch they always out to focus must have pissed him off recently huh corporal really doubt they'd attack like this unprovoked one reason only always the same we're so ugly music is okay so what's on me to do you must reach the agent easy now to find him look at the map he is in cinema okay step away now this isn't your fight what what proceed what god pushed out the runner know you are here hunt him probably not big a fight with the watch if i don't have to you will not i will uh lucas i'm playing on normal difficulty he does what he says i've already been up here to the cinema what the hell oh my god what is that whoa okay uh matilda k rose matilda i'm sorry you like that no i don't yeah i don't like it one bit i barely scratched her look at the health oh my god i can't even get a chance to attack i just want to reload maybe i should use the shotgun she keeps getting health back [Music] what the what is going on oh that's the weak spot right there that's how we do it you gotta get the weak spot leave me alone i'm running out of ammo i don't like the scrambling either i guess this is like a little mini boss fight right ow that's insane i think she's had enough i think she's sad enough no i can't let that live i'm sorry it's it's a danger to society no we it's not it's not acceptable we can't i'm sorry no there's no way i'm letting that live that's my first proper boss fight i guess like i've not had anything like that before i'm getting there there's no way through there thank you say he's helping me again he's watching what the hell are these the kind of movies that they watch in 2077 black hawk dawn of the dead coming soon robert adler isn't isn't that the guy from call of duty cold war invade him we need access to the data clear you must first proceed arms second amendment is not only for the rich whoa hey easy what did you do well now we can talk he's watching a movie just severed the let's go any deal has to come all right then let's hear it had a spectre on you didn't you saw and heard all you did you followed his orders no idea what the voodoo boys are paying you but our pockets are deeper what move is that not interested not a money job for me just needing in with mama bridget voodoo chef russell adler not robert and her lap dog t neptune have been frozen several days now ever since we shrouded their subnet with ice and you well you were sent here to free them do you know why they didn't tell you everything because you're a iranian what's a runyon that's what they call outsiders brought in for special jobs floor rags when you're no longer needed they chuck you a fate for all ranions got anything to back that cruise give me proof but the voodoos want to set me up wanna they did it already soon as you handed over your link slipped in the specter and a virus talking as if he was there he's working you so obvious it hurts ask for proof besides i'd know that so then please take a look run a system diagnostic [Music] fine [Music] i don't trust him not just anyone in this game and nothing out of place no trace of do it again then cross check the result against the first is it going to be the same identical right because it's not a real scam it's a copy all right what are you offering a compromise i'll fish the voodoo virus out of your system and i release both brigitte and t neptune they'll wake up like nothing ever happened not to worry and all you got to do is let us walk with our data thoughts clocks flipping digits hmm i don't know i don't like making these kind of choices johnny thinks that he's playing me last chance they're all playing me [Music] oh no [Applause] then i started corpo well whatever i did has ruined me tried to jack into him and it's just fried my system johnny hey v you all right oh what happened the net pig was right voodoos were blowing smoke as soon as you gave them access to the netwatch web they roasted all the agents and you then why is my brain not a pile of hot goo you know you finally grew up there toughed it out think the voodoos freed brigitte seems that was their plan worked thanks to you i'd say after the voodoo's turned you into a [ __ ] kamikaze drone who'd take a job from us spooky ass voodoo boys plessy took you for pathetic gutter trash someone who no one's ever gonna please use me then so what i should spill the truth no we take this to prisciet saved her sorry ass after all wouldn't mind a quick word with placide too shouldn't let this lie head to baddies grumpy [ __ ] hope he likes surprises i mean i'm sure he's quite surprised when the bag of food fell into his crotch what's going on here is that fried is it all encrypted i bet someone on the internet has uh coded that already binary isn't it i'll get in there that was a keanu moment yes we're correct where's the body gun i killed her right here she get up and leave nice looking shotgun we've also got tough morning that's for coffee taste the didn't expect me to be alive did you i'm not getting in a car with you because it'll crash my game i'm not doing it it's going to be some point in the later in the game i have to get in a car yeah i did get some skills didn't i two pro points hello the rock yeah i like the shotguns they're good we get any um look at that terrible bandana oh my god i'm embarrassed to wear that what am i do why have i got that bandana on because it's 21 armor that's why samurai armored knee pad races was it 56.1 get any cool weapons then oh she had a hammer didn't she is that the one that i picked up i think i picked up that hammer look at this pistol hello smart weapons without cyberware okay i do have a load of junk again it's fine what's up adriana how are you doing georgia in case this is still in development no they've released it now i think that they'll be working on fixing the bugs and the stability though i'll be another patch soon i imagine i don't know if it'll be before christmas though that guy just doesn't have any audio ah too far too far right so that was purposeful i think cyberpunk yeah it is conrad cyberpunk livestream right now don't betray me again i know where you live oh the seed he won't be here anymore surely you know what i mean like he's gone where is the bastard where this way let me in that's right you set me up that's right she's talking but her lips aren't moving you must be british hard woman to find you have something for me you know about the biochip don't you yes and we must check its condition how much you know for my scans more than classed i'm sure you recognize the biochip because you were looking for it we must examine you if you survive the gym it is at the chip's cost should have thought about that before you tried to kill me if i was here the chip would never be in danger if it is in good condition we offer you a fair price perhaps more for the emotional tool [Music] biochip's not for sale you're not ripping it out of me thing was in [ __ ] shape already before i strolled into the gym it does not function not that bad problem is no one i've talked to can yank it out without risk of death dying seems to commission the thing's theft figured you might know a way to help how do you know all this how did you find us can you help me or not yes of course but not here we will go to the crib where you must give us access to the jeep once we have the data we need we will do our best to help then after you whoa okay seems so weird the way it just jumps around like that you don't give off a strong religious vibe we left our gods on haiti yet we are strong here without them going to church this way so how come placee didn't know about the biochip he didn't recognize it in the scans few of our people know about konbeki tower but he is like the ico it's good oh my god she's sprinting oh soon you will see catching up with the player the watcher did not notice the bio chipping you strange never gave him a chance good it would complicate our work johnny's under the radar man you can't detect him there's an old subway tunnel no part of the trans-continental maglev system when all states were connected like the net it too crumbled after the war it's not what elon musk is working on in california he's trying to connect san francisco to los angeles with a underground is it underground magnet magnetic train or something it goes super super duper fast we take you into this cyber space no better place for you to interact with your construct we're going into the matrix okay hang on i want to know what you need silverhand for first we wish to contact all cunningham we know she and silverhand were close the relic which arasaka held close it is our only lead alt cunningham heard of her oh where from who keaney knows what's your plan to contact alt we try to cut out a unique piece of silver hand's engram from the biochip alt will know it if something of the human is left after years beyond the black wall she will answer well what you said nothing about breaking through the black wall well now you know [Music] it's the matrix there okay what now hyperloop that's it take the red pill take the blue pill [Music] where are we this is our bbs data fortress bridge to the deep net so what now what now we can begin all is ready we enhance your link to silverhand's neural network for a short time to grab the fragment we must find the data on alt alt alone this should only take [Music] it's a bit freaky can hear rock music [Applause] what's happening we're back on that stage again we've done this already [Music] [Applause] [Applause] where you gonna take it did he just shoot someone random in the crowd it's not your day oh my god what the hell what's wrong with the what what no no no but i'm the only one with a vision [Music] so unless you got a better one like i said go [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

car you've got a problem oh my god dude what is that character doing [Music] i'm not sure about these set piece sequences that this game has they just don't they don't seem to be that polish the best way i would describe it they go for these like epic scenes like this but they're just not quite there i'll park somewhere [Music] there's been a few unreal sections like this already crash all right so we gotta pull out our asaka alt cunningham dead oh yeah the tower what's the taker there this gets better by the minute how you want to play this either you don't got a plan yep distract him make some noise set up right under our osaka's windows and crank it loud let's go baby it'll be a gig to remember [Music] it's a pre-rendered video as well i think it's the first one i've seen they all agree a psychoactive agent has been dispersed at the site affecting those in the crowd all right well we're gonna go get old back then you recording this whole thing uh-huh why want to say a few words to the folks at home he's live streaming while i'm live streaming to you guys it's not cool [Music] what's up thompson know him well no why's it matter don't like the guy don't trust him and medias are bad luck what bad luck say someone finds a tape later a tape of us breaking into arasaka tower worry about that if we make it out come on we don't have much time surrender yourself surrender yourself open it up are you [ __ ] up here references to the matrix find the mainframe worst turret ever let me try rip it open nope son of a [ __ ] c4 knocking at your door still recording why we best step back you [ __ ] gun what what did he call me that's all in there isn't it yeah sorry well they were right there this guy's a boss akira got him hi right let's get all back i would advise you not to disturb her what'd you do to alt i prefer to work on a project of a lifetime why get out of my way oh oh come on don't do this she dead is she [ __ ] johnny the hell are you doing are you still rolling this is all we can do now my man show people the truth won't change she's not johnny stop that you have to kill him [Music] we gotta go johnny she's dead pretty brussel well spit it out before you burst never even told me half that about all really any examples i don't know that you were a couple that she wrote soul killer that she's dead how the hell is she supposed to help us now as a ghost she's not dead managed to escape i saw the body oh fled into the net though she's in here somewhere when'd you find out when she made contact a little later and what'd she say that she was a captain in the arasaka subnet but they couldn't hurt her and she told me not to come looking for her so what did you do got my hands on two thermonuclear charges oh yeah then headed back to our soccer tower look at sky high the boys think they know where she is beyond the black wall where nobody can touch her brigitte's primed to go there break through just to contact alt talk to her too much for our little pro so that's why he set the nuke off and his girl is in here somewhere in the dark net but she's being held captive so did it work yes we extract the necessary fragment of silver hands anger we are ready now to make contact with alt first we must dive deeper deeper now what is going on oh my god i'm tripping balls right now just she me a ladder don't do it i held up my end of ordeal your turn before you pass through that wall i want johnny's psyche removed no i like it we will not pass through you will take the call to the other side don't got much for options do i ali how do i get to the other side it's a leap of faith regime alt johnny no it's v you cannot remain here [Music] old cunningham she's always so naked what's going on we will talk here relax let me handle this johnny came through the black wall to meet me that mean we're good things are chilled between us i have recognized your engram code but i do not know why you are here to give you a chance to pay me back for getting you out of our soccer tower v this is all best net runner night city's ever seen nice to meet you old this is v you need to save his life to save my life what's it gonna cost netwatch propaganda has been effective do you see me as a demon who requires a pact signed in blood [Music] no listen i'm just trying to survive i cannot help you can't or won't can't to attempt to do so i would need access to more advanced technology what but it's your take you created soulkiller the program i created has little in common with how arasaka has since repurposed it fine so how about makoshi that advanced enough for you if i could gain access to mikoshi it would cease to exist good we can work with that we'll get you inside mikoshi and you'll help me deal what can you do for me exactly with the soul killer resident inside mikoshi i will create a construct of you then disentangle your neural network from johnny's i shall then inject your engram back into your mortal form that sounds really complicated right so we got a plan but how will you reach mikoshi i've created armies that failed to breach it they were children of the net there's your problem we're banking on the human factor we'll crack a window slip you into makoshi so we agreed yes we are agreed find a path into mikoshi i shall prepare a program to help you navigate the local net how will i contact you once i'm ready this is a pbs address it will be our secure communication channel voodoo boys what about them they shall let you pass unharmed those were our terms that's a mind job right there he could have taken his clothes off right everyone else in this game does now he's just got soggy be clothes to see how your deal with alt works out won't be easy to duper and i'm not sure you guys know another way to operate you dare now to election i think i'd rather give you your do but other ranyons never live to enjoy this moment enough old can protect you in her room but here and now you are in mine you can draw your weapon here actually was just on my way i mean that would probably create an entirely different scenario wouldn't it like i bet there's so much replayability in this game how many endings there must be i dread to think didn't the witcher have like six endings or something i bet this one's got like 15 or 16 something crazy like that all right we're out there what's the format pearl sasha how you doing yes i did go corporal look hey look see that [ __ ] those cuts whatever you gotta say say it got something eaten at your code that's clear you're trying to learn how you're wired this whole time to know who i'm dealing with i thought you were just unlucky at first but i kept watching and finally realized what your problem is always been a corpocog a replaceable part once saka booted you out stripped you of perks best you could hope for was to be a scav exterminator you seem to know a lot about my past well seeing flashes of your past just like you've seen flashes of mine pisses me off that our memories blend don't have my own anymore ship's the worst thing never [ __ ] happened to me mean to say i haven't earned the top spot yet an arrogant asshole's no small problem but it ain't my biggest dying is death by becoming someone else you didn't do anything to deserve that fate hmm you afraid of death is he already dead really afraid of wasted opportunities like arasaka tower came through it as you not having control you can't stand it seeing some things are out of your hands don't be ridiculous fee [Music] gotta go hang in there bud [Music] shaking really appreciate it if you didn't make this difficult that was a trip we went to the matrix we met old cunningham had a good time murdered a load of people things are going great is there a problem here officer officer you appear to be stuck inside the car that does look like a problem maybe i should help i just want to see you get out of the car that's all you know that's what i'm here for we'll get you out there mate don't worry everything's gonna be fine there you go you got you made out the car yes what do i get in return oh we get [ __ ] done too don't you worry yep no civilian access i mean i did just save your ass i know you're shouting at me i don't know about that anyways let's get my car oh where are you i called you car car you press v and the car is supposed to come the car is not going that is the worst horn i've ever heard and because of that i'm taking this don't crash don't crash don't crash don't crash [Music] it didn't crash we're okay [Music] i do have a look around the area i lost contact with the delamane network vehicle nearby so this dude has got me looking around for rogue ai automatic cars that have gone off the rails a bit and you have to get them and then bring them back to the garage japan town docks that's 1.9 k away see if there's a uh yeah we've got a fast travel thing up here that we can dip into you can work with the cops under ncpd hustles oh that sounds cool [Applause] right so we need to go meet takamura there at the docks there is a fast travel right there which dlss i think we're on performance at the moment kb i changed it oh it was automatic but i put it on performance because it kept crashing at the start of the stream it hasn't crashed for a while though but i don't want to count my chickens before they've hatched you know i've got to go down anyway all that matters with angelique cosmetics how you look is all that matters personality is not important at all don't worry about that yeah day you can do third person driving but only first person most the game is first person i'm consistently impressed with the level of detail in the geometry the buildings all the different levels and flying cars and all sorts see takamaru is here it is good to see you be sure to uh secluded here it is appropriate for such a secret meeting friend you mentioned here hola he should be here any moment now willing finally to give me the spec on him hanako arasakas from the carrier at anchor in the bay saburo's daughter yes and if he believes you will next meet with her just hope he doesn't blindly follow arasaka protocol what protocol unwritten rules had him here in night city could be different in japan if ia got even a whiff of treason they prep an enhanced interrogator and sent two elite squads with air support to grab the suspect i understand the point you seek to make but if oda has ulterior motives he will need no elites no air support no one but himself trust me i have seen him work that's supposed to be reassuring if it helps you stay calm you can gaze at the sky by god huh a good sign he is usually camouflaged do hola think the game feels unpolished larry yeah it does there's a lot of bugs i think it needed a few more months in the oven this [Music] give it like six months and it'll be there won't be any bugs but it's released now so it's a bit late for that is this him your thief he's my witness be can speak for myself you so speak i have been told you know things i know lots of things she's there so what happened you're a nobu strangle the old guy silence not one word more you will bring death to your door but it is it's the truth yeah we saw it happen my one concern his own son strangled him in this city forgotten by the gods is she in danger now no yet during the parade to honor most certainly i bring you this witness to his murder and do you dare to worry about the silly parade fool correct but you can't ignore the truth it is what it is is what he's trying to say unlike you i have not yet failed to keep my oath to do my duty you will regret those words the only thing i regret is that i came here to meet you there is a price on your head eyes are but it's gonna take much longer [Music] i do you a favor now by not cutting it off and taking it straight to your inner summer what would you do now were you in my place i do no favors i would deliver you a head to your nose you were an arasaka soldier gotta convince them this is not a request we remind you of your duty to be truthful to your superiors i did not come here to be lectured by a thief wasn't always what i am now and your friend here didn't always look like a bum feel free to join us plenty of room at the bottom of the heap not enticed then do your duty tell hanako what nobody else wants to hear that should be to him as you say food of all thought i think we convince them like it is sometimes it is a shame nothing will come of it how come it should have been obvious oda is a perfectionist he most appears to me coming through what the hell good [ __ ] written what is that one-hour soccer whack job is already giant statue on a boat well i can't say we didn't try we tried so brandon yes if i can contain something useful thank you for coming how do you figure that what oda said they returned to tokyo after the parade do you not see the parade it is our chance perhaps if somehow we can get to hanako we must do a proper reconnaissance first agreed we'll need a precise map of japan town agreed it is your turn to call on friends do you know a fixer who could help can't wait to visit japan in real life sure why not it's gonna go this year but corona said no you're gonna shuffle over or oh you want me to drive gg street what is this name just a night city name beware you mocked me i'm not mocking you dude you alright guro yes why the sudden concern i'm just asking something with you have to have an ulterior motive i apologize that came off wrong i am i am simply not used to such questions no one ever cares about him either we are doing well or we are in a grave luck or why isn't it any idea what's going on at arasaka only what i can summarize from what i see on tv your innova and his puppets green at the cameras and insist that everything is under control but the wider the smile the bigger the lies get that yeah i'd love to visit tokyo see what it's like in the city and then the you know the temples and everything and the countryside around it all right we're getting out what shaken night city your man stand here to all those machines yeah we count to 60 fps uh there's the frame rate in the top right unapplicable that's working great try again not applicable we've got infinite frames basically that's all you need to know guys it's just not applicable yo yo ever try rainbow poppers purple haze got every color under the sun i do i don't want any drugs got something that'll keep you hard for hours for algorithm let's go now oh please another face in the crowd yes is this bugged i'm right here member member uh i think it's bugs oh you are just in time oh my god that was close he almost recognized me that a comedian the scripting broke then didn't know i went in too early he should have just realized what was going on and put me in there to be a misunderstanding i have no idea who jumped your team but the claws no never my boys know their place i i i'm sorry got to go i have guests well well who do i spy but v in my humble parlor no less mucaco long time no see so what brings you here and your charming friend is he's cool happen to be working together that's all a true gentleman oh shame only that he's being hunted by all our osaka's soldiers and uv bring him to my door give me one reason why i shouldn't notify the proper authorities right away caution caution world's most wanted japanese fugitives hide now in night city and you got nothing to do with it please we know they're thinking they'll link you to us faster than you can finish puffing on that sig so tell me and mark well i still have my phone at hand need intel on the parade that's scheduled to come through japan town so it's arasaka again why come to me did mr deshawn not come to the phone dead come on got your finger on the hood's pulse know everything parade honoring saburo arasaka you're prepping in some way no doubt won't see me dressed in mourning but the rest is true everything's on the shards how much does this cost my pockets are empty clearly my gift to you it's free for free what is free often proves most costly gonna take them or not the amount of things i've put in my head man in this game it is to be sealed off for the parade dashi platforms the main attraction they'll fly this way high above street level along the parade route balconies footbridges and vantage points affording good views a guest of honor will deliver her speech from the largest float she'll do this exactly here got no idea about security but given recent events expect it to be tight this might be a sniper mission our last parade our sucker undercovers infiltrated the crowd not to mention a smattering of sharp shooters yeah snipers and if that's not enough fun for one day a net runner won at least they used the city cctv to observe everything main access point here it's an old automated control center if you ask me most useful by far at the end the floats afloat out of japan town and we'll be left with trash up to our elbows that no one will collect that's it it's all i have it must be enough then go be on your way thanks mukako we appreciate this we have some outstanding biz to settle remember sandra dorsett i don't forget such things v reward now here is your reward it comes with a fairly ample bonus oh thank you i was saying something sorry smart gun compatibility okay are delightful i like her a lot yeah this is nice it could be just what we need but i will try to investigate further i'll stay here sometime

must be prepping him for a transfer how would you know chinese corporal playbook's an open one to me this looks like the old vanishing pigeon decrypted map of upcoming kang tao convoy roots think hellman might be in one of them thing is which one take a look at the specs on this one alone av no ground support no linked cargo manifests either weird sure kang tao sometimes transports stuff unregistered if they want to push it under the table but catch the load on the save already approved in the system but too low so definitely no cargo on board huh but there's a passenger list kang tao security detail plus one vip transfer from chantine our boy hellman that was the good news there it is data's all confidential you just snap your fingers and it falls in your lap i know where to look and i know whose head to put in a vice also hate wasting time exploding like a watermelon stupid questions so what's the bad news bad news is the extraction set look night city airspace all this no way to jack the transport that the ncpd picking up on it and here we're too close to kang tao we even give that av a dirty look their backup hustle will be on us but right here's jackson plains narrow corridor just outside the city and just out of kangtal's reach yes it's your lucky day a dead zone i'll grab him there i'm gonna snatch him gonna need a native to the area someone who'll set up the op cobbled together the gear so a native know any hick mercs just one kick pan am palmer she can't count on her clan anymore but she's a true nomad she knows those lands and she will help you won't have

your car getting them back i can help with that the real freight yard on bonita street the one hugging the city line what are you doing there graffiti is bad you're not even drawing anything dude no i'm busy [Music] i think the best thing about the graphics in this game is the ambient light [Music] it just looks alive doesn't it very good [Music] they look weird man like cyclops or something that's 2.7 kilometers away it makes me really excited for next-gen games on the s5 and series x because they would have had to hold this game back to a certain degree because it's on the older consoles and i don't know if you guys have seen what it looks like and how it runs on the base ps4 and xbox one it's not good it's not good at all but on pc i do think this is especially the lighting in particular is it's very good obviously there's bugs left right and center but makes me excited for true next-gen games like the next god of war for example i think that is gonna look absolutely insane on ps5 next battlefield game you know oh new frostbite engine that could be insane as well ow rumors of activism nice dodge [Music] why have i got that stupid bandana on still i need to get rid of that miss my turn [Music] nc back with you so soon how's your afternoon alexander pushkin a senior staffer in biotechnica quality assurance has gone missing his superiors have reached out saying

me get out there and enjoy the sun what the hell and then things like that [Music] happened yeah it definitely needed a few more months in the oven didn't it this one this reminds me of downtown l.a

called the bonaventure it's like a central tower surrounded by three other towers and then there's a mall nearby looks so similar to that [Music] we might be going out to the desert here finally look at that [Music] i'd like to take a wide berth since we're going on the corners right to say hello they call me el capitan and they call you that's right see no introduction is necessary i already took

corp convoy no i don't do abductions besides you'd need many more bodies and heaps of gear to take a convoy it's just one av plan brood will take it over jackson planes [ __ ] in return info on your

sometime keep an eye on rv i would like to see inside the box please how can you run this 30 90. and an i9 5 gigahertz that's how seems you got a real problem with authority what rogue saul your leader their leader seemed in a hurry to delve the hell out of there let's just say saul wouldn't have been happy to see me what happened the reason we came to california was because he promised to change for the all decaldoes he claimed we would turn over a new leaf but you saw it we got a handful of tents on a heap of sand a hell of a promised land i wanted something different better okay we have arrived what do we do we get ready to greet the raffins and we have little time for that we'll need to improvise we should scout first to look for anything that might be useful hmm right i can equip my pistol now i think got some points as well here so maxed that out [Music] i get a new look at this still i think what i've got on is is better still isn't it virtual jumpsuit oh i got that from going in the matrix didn't i uh pistol there we go check it out smart pistol it's cool rocky ridge could be any deader everything's down nothing works here well have you found anything i found that nothing works all cut off well we'll make it work the raffins will roll in after dusk we will have a surprise ready for them we just need to get some power flowing let's check the substation okay scan the transformer [Music] can we not use it found the breakers but there's no juice on them i'll get the gas come down i know how to surprise the bastards how right so the intersection is powered from that transformer substation right the switch gear on the roof we'll flip the switch there and everything will light up like christmas understood got it so classic root good old diversion thank you very much martin i appreciate that first we don't know how many are coming my thinking is it'll be a sizable crew second we have to create an opening to get to my car if they're bunched together we won't stand a chance so we give him a little light show at the intersection yes we'll breathe some life into this dusty old town as soon as they see the lights they'll have to check who why and how nova yep first we start up the control terminal below the gear on the roof is a hunk of junk without it come on we'll give it a boost from the car battery that should do the trick anthony thanks for finding the substation i'll bring the car around yeah i don't know how you use the smart pistols i think you just highlight people and then you just shoot and it flies the bullets around the corner and stuff i've seen it in the trailers but i've not done it in game yet i've still not tested out my uh my zipper either a whippersnapper the panel looks to be in good shape i'll make a bypass circuit to the power supply that should do it we'll do it to get it up and running please grab the jumper cables from the truck we'll boost it from the car battery do i get to use that rifle please i would like that red cable connected give me a moment i need to hook everything up here it just moved by itself i'm done now the black rattler there she goes not the old jalopy served us well jalopy what's that i've got voltage start the terminal inside and once the power is on in the building get on that roof you got it i'll set up on the tower we'll have the whole intersection on a platter you flip the breakers when i give you the signal to do so understood yes ma'am i like her activate switchgear's got power prime we'll have some fun at the intersection let's get into position now did it actually give me that sniper rifle then i don't think it did i've already got one the one i got is okay now we wait remember as soon as we see them you give us power got it cover me just in case of course let's take them by surprise let's try to do this quietly if anything happens i'll start picking them off it's okay sounds great i'm really good at the stealth and i'm just really good at it so many of them [Music] you wait for him here get good and ready the show now let there be light grab the car shot right okay how do i use this look at that let's go around the corner you can just shoot people around corners with this it's sick it's like a smart pistol grenade let me throw the grenade okay down i think my uh my game's bugged out again it did this yesterday when i was playing the health bar at the top just breaks then sometimes it gives you god mode i wanted to test it's only a matter of the girls colorful bunch i don't know how they spot me then as well okay we can test this oh and it doesn't do much damage though when you ads it fires in like bursts it's weird helping me i think she's sniping there she is give me all the things press f over everything [Music] it's gonna die from the dot i think yeah good work what now a few shifts don't breathe getting the car out of here no need to risk it fine meet me at the city line north side oh you can get smgs and everything which is smart pistols see you soon all right we've got to take this how do we get in it let's finish this [Music] get our dodge get to the meeting point what [ __ ] what move i'll take the wheel how did she uh there okay you drive i'll shoot you that's a really weird janky transition there like all the sound stopped the music stopped it just instantly came to a halt i think she's happy with that though [Music] are we supposed to be driving and she's prime wheels isn't she amy indeed i'm surprised you wanted her back she completes me see managed just fine without mitch and scorpion it was fine

morning that's what we were after we got him six street away from the world listen to me for [ __ ] sake i know where their little hidey hole is we'll take the old unfortunately they will not be expecting us i'm sure of it a nash hunt wasn't part of our deal only because i thought he would show up in rocky ridge but he didn't might not even be in their hideout i know he's there v that [ __ ] raffin cheated me i can't just let it go i can't do you really not understand that all right so where's this hideout i'll hop and skip away whoa thanks fee what nash did she's so weird i placed my trusty he was the first person i worked with after leaving the elder caldos after i came to night city and i granted him my trust i get it know how you feel little hidey hole had someone betray me just like that once and did you make them pay never got the chance someone else got to him first but if they had it would you have done it um no doubt no doubt skipping a beat let's get this over with let's go murder everyone it's okay don't that long are you ready let's get him in and out first [Music] is this supposed to be ai here or something he's mine it's seriously cool though that you can just like see that i'm taking cover and i'm just throwing bullets at the dude although they're not really hitting him because he's behind cover oh my god she's going crazy grenade again gonna get my shotgun back out i think seemed like it was doing a lot more damage assault rifle maybe a sidewinder is that one of the smart gunners as well yeah it is oh that's more like it oh yeah get in that's awesome throw the nades god not the net runners never runners are okay so you can just shoot through everything with this sniper it's too good they always just like standing there they don't really do

or something oh we good and we killed everyone i'm just gonna check around see if there's any loot here anything hidden away over all the things what's the goal there what was that smart smg maybe press f simulator right are you happy now can i get that car that looks sick bro what did you say again solve your own problems clean up your [ __ ] smash is dead one [ __ ] clean happens and that's

well used to that thorn of yours thanks for everything partner she's neck in that another one over here thanks noah cheers let me know if you need anything else all right time to look to my needs what's the plan for helmet i've come up with a plan a first draft but i need to sleep on it work it out then we can talk about the details i think it best to rent rooms here just to stay in the area we'll get to work around midnight it'll help keep us out of sight agreed maybe we rent just one room good idea noah has two twin beds in every room we'll save some money okay i won't insist separate beds got it no one will need a room twin beds just for tonight i'll go catch a few wings ugh i'm starting to feel that stress go away i'll probably be out as soon as i hit the sack that'll be the alcohol you would better get some rest too this is only the beginning that's the plan steal all the things what do i look like a complete idiot my hair's just disappeared my character has hair but it's just not rendered uh did we get any more perks yeah we did no a black one it's the worst bandana ever dies it's so bad right good night lady i'm sure you could romance this character if you wanted to my name is thanks for the intel things flow differently out here keep your head on city kid do i know you you look quite drunk lady v one of my missing vehicles could be near your current position got it yeah i've not had the pp glitch yet on some people's games the pp sticks out of the jeans hey hello i'm just checking the suspension the hydraulics have to be shipped shape we're in for a bumpy ride yeah brother did you sleep all right i can't complain it was like that come up with anything for home and i mean as a matter of fact i did look here okay tell me we're the wrench the cutter is the av and the screwdriver is where the av should bury its nose cone in the dust now you must be wondering how we get the av to do that that'll hmg of yours my gun will be useful elsewhere this caliber would barely dent the armor of a heavy hitter like that there are other ways here the clamps are solution a satwaf power station what now um sat wave power station yes we need to break into it so far so good but then what and then we strike we hit the av with an emp of course we do exactly the av is in range we cause an electromagnetic pulse the onboard electronics should fail out right meaning what engines will shut down everything will shut down engines included drive navigation communication systems it's all gone all right let's ride great hop in a bit mad max isn't it let's go i think i've seen some video footage of this in one of their previews it looks like a cool mission this one i thought it crashed then for a second god got ptsd about it man please don't crash please don't crash we're fine who owns this power station go over corp is there any difference who do you think pulls the government's strings hey i'm just wondering whose toes were about to step all over lee look around it is simple everything you see is owned by a corporation you like to mess with the corpse huh whatever gave you that idea well wait scratch that i'm a wrong sir nash the wrath you just like to mess with everyone he's a player playing the game on your side this giant bridge and now for something completely different weirdest thing you've ever transported go what are we playing 20 questions come on answer the deputy finance director of cow cause that's chauffeuring not smuggling he wrote in the trunk flatlined really dead a long story maybe someday i'll tell you i haven't seen this bridge where are we going we're quite far out of the city we'll make a quick stop here that's the wrong side of the road we need to calibrate you with a turret i want you to be able to use the gun too okay i'm down for that connect here how should i connect personal link how else the eyes watch the jack looks like zendaya wired in wait a moment diagnostics first [ __ ] it keeps giving me an error mod let me work around it and now pan am here's johnny out in the middle of bum [ __ ] nowhere great work fee ah just crashed it's always in the car every single time it crashes in the car it's like the third third fourth time i think this stream [Music] this is probably a 200 good game i think it's about 70 gig ashton it was for me on pc anyway i don't know how big it is on console great hop in it's cold out here all right we can skip this give ahead i'm just wondering whose toes were about to step all over v look around it is simple everything you see is owned by a corporation you like the message whatever gave you that idea or wait scratch that rogue nash the wrath you just like to mess with everyone well then i suppose it's a good thing i'm on your side isn't it you like to mess with the corpse huh whatever gave you that idea no we just said that squeak on skip rogue nash the rafters you just like to mess with everyone then i suppose it's a good thing i'm on your side it's a good thing it's a really good thing it's a great thing so great so great and now for something completely different weirdest thing you've ever transported go what are we playing 20 questions in the back of the car the deputy finance director i mean this is cool not smuggling he wrote in the trunk flatlined we've almost reached the damn we'll make a quick stop here we need to calibrate you with a turret okay i want you to be able to use the gun too and shut up our chances in general connect here how should i connect personal link how else just watch the jack sometimes you have to jig a little bit wired in wait a moment diagnostics [ __ ] first keeps giving me an error odd let me work around it and now pan am here's johnny out in the middle of bum [ __ ] nowhere great work fee hey yeah i think your implant has a virus the one in the nape of your neck it's not a virus just a little malware you get used to it eventually screw you will it affect the calibration we shall see okay here goes nothing she's calibrating me with the machine gun fire a short burst into it yeah good next target single shot we're done here okay just one more longer round great we're done i think that's cool i like that was it uh-huh just wondering how to work with moving targets the gun is calibrated you'll have system support just be careful with the recoil it sometimes knocks things out of balance so where's this power station you will see in a moment i know a spot we'll have a decent view from there i just want to be sure the area is clear sabotage a corporal power station jump a corporate transport kidnap a corporate suit that's a plug for the word corporal do you have a point know what you're starting to remind me of me 50 years back minus the charisma an impressive [ __ ] hmm maybe we can just get along let me remind you an impressive cockey for me not to stick it to our sock this is life or death my life let me remind you that socking their [ __ ] up tech is what got you here who gives a [ __ ] about motives ends justify the means and right now your end is to survive survive this is spot right here all looks clear the area looks deserted i see no patrols the huge thing is the collection unit and see the antennas each antenna collects microwave energy from satellites in orbit that's then converted into electric power oh antennas run all the way down the interstate mm-hmm and they're linked it's foreign to your advantage we just need to mess with the collection unit a chain reaction will follow each one of the antennas will emit an emp burst the av will be like a fly headed for a spider's web we just have to fire off the pulse at the right moment let's go get her once we reach the station i'll set up a bypass for the detonator you just overload the systems overload the system yes ma'am when do i start though hoping that's not too complicated is it it shouldn't be you just turn everything up as far as it'll go crank it up to 11. got it so what now we wait we should time our arrival to the av flight plan got it wait for daytime good time to roll and johnny's just chilling in the back like this before downing an av by myself no why do you ask power station emp the systems networks came up with a really solid plan thank you how you approach things that's the trick minus the aaa wait what now assessment assembly action whatever your task you do three things start by assessing what you already have and what you'll face the problem then you plan with those variables in mind take what you have get what you need assemble things people finally you take action simple got one word for you t-shirts aaa that's all you need to leave the good life that and the occasional cold beer what if uh something goes ass up well then your ass had better improvise did you really think i'd just give you a foolproof secret to success gotta say almost had me believing just that too much sometimes we oh you you can press c and corona ends i don't think that's true alex we're getting the vaccine um some people have had it this week in the uk we drive in [ __ ] up the system and get the hell out of there old people are getting it next week could get a little bumpy get ready let's do it i'm ready get on the gun here we go [Music] provided we hurry what's what is going on with it it's so janky i'll connect the detonator quick ah [ __ ] nah it's not it's not great we are dying one more [ __ ] i think we might have overdone it get out of there did you see that all lit up and blinking like a crystal you wanted 11. yeah let's get out of here before it lights us up too there's no sound for the car or anything v get the [ __ ] out before something happens to the chance of the tip it looks like i'm running as well look it's bobbing up a picnic maybe layout watch out the next one johnny johnny [ __ ] hell it's just stuck in this like bombing animation okay i'm fine it's okay just it's okay i'm fine yeah just dealt to the [ __ ] out not the cleanest job perhaps but it still went well what about the detonator is it working yes it's working and i don't even see a drop in the signal strength we just need to drive far away enough to keep the pulse from blasting us too the cliff there we'll set up it should give us a good view of the antennas okay here's the sniper times we wait okay just give me that rifle here always wanted to push the big red button on something like this how do we know when don't worry i'll have eyes on it you just wait for my signal then set off that pulse they won't know what hit them and by the way what we are about to knock a multi-million euro dollar kang tao asset clean out of the sky how does that make you feel blessed and [ __ ] exactly what the doc ordered exactly that's exactly what i like to hear just noticed what it's quiet the home of the city people's voices the smells it's all gone wind just intensifies it think i forgot quiet exists though maybe not the smells i mean the coyotes rather hard to miss thought that was just the air freshener and you thornton ha ha screw you you'd do better to focus on the av keep your eyes open it's just dancing is it joe it's all is it's like i'm sprinting in the car it's there coming from pacifica all right get ready one more second one more now boom there she is do it [ __ ] what's going on fan [ __ ] tastic it's not working damn at all there it is pam the engines are still running [ __ ] they're getting away they're going nowhere we gotta go after it i mean we do have a giant turret like it's obviously oh what are you doing think she's firing a rocket but the rocket launcher's not there she got it that's how you do it good job we got the bastard let's go this whole section is so buggy oh there's the rocket launcher it's back how could she drive she can't see anything she's got a rocket launcher in her face or better get the hell out they probably want to help the survivors without knowing it's perfect they can't hear me the pulse is interfering yes get ready get me and coach let's go baby oh come on she's got the rocket launcher it's not helping you it's just getting in the way just put it down it'll be way easier i promise i'm fine okay good thank you for fixing the turret okay i've done it it's magic yeah and i'm gonna move on we gotta catch it saw it behind that hill well one last thing to worry about still there okay [ __ ] ricochet i think you can manage sure i'll live don't worry i'm not worried about you it's the rocket launcher that i'm worried about hello perfect keep broadcasting over an open channel just in case they missed you the first time god swear something's done right did you hear those shots face something happened to them check it out i see the wreck but no scorpion or mitch can i get out and stop this bombing animation please looks expired use it anyway go on i dare you hug hug chubby connect to the drone we'll scan the area we have to get our bearings please let's roll you connecting to visual mm-hmm v if they got the alticalidas if they got mitch and scorpion i can't i don't know i know at least they put with the rocket launcher i'm in control it's not there anymore scan it no no no no no no no no no no no no i'm sorry your clan all to call those yes they're dead all of them mitch isn't dead if they don't worry can we take it down somehow [Music] uh how [Music] maybe but we have to get there first it's not for those damned glitches i could have warned them this is all my doing why in the hell were they following the av probably keeping hellman in the av aren't you it will blow us to bits if we approach you're already blown to bits don't be an idiot this is just a scratch it's about to scratch check out the launcher i will try no you stay in the car sorry but you're just gonna slow me down [ __ ] lv those are my people out there they're dying the launcher out of the way i'll let you know then you go in and help me with the rest deal yes sir i still have mitch's rifle i am the ranking officer cover you from here good idea let's move oh i wanted to do the sniping as we're not bobbing anymore yes we're back take out the turret i've got to get to that control panel suspect oh my god combat then oh it's fine rockets out here that's cool what's this that's a rocket launcher isn't it utilizing measures of immediate coercion i think that's a rocket launcher we so weird why did it just roll over here like that kobe kobe oh [Music] refusing to cooperate there's no cooperation he's got a smart pistol as well jack in i wanted to get her rocket launcher that's what i wanted that's clear i'm coming for you just gonna take a look at that rocket launcher see what that is [Music] annihilation oh i got a couple nice pistols here precision

entourage you must be looking for a way to call base so you're the ones who hit him with that emp yeah we tried to warn you you know it couldn't connect if they took your cars we might be able to
