yeah give me a lift that's my kind string on all deal give me a lift he doesn't want to give me a lift welcome back guys to bf5 really fancy playing it today i haven't been on for a few weeks now i think the last time i played it was single player oh no it was on hamada and i played against the dirty chi and apparently their account is banned now so that makes me really happy it warms my insides aerodrome is this i think it is i'm using the k7 now this gun looks good doesn't it this used to be the most overpowered thing in the game when the game released was it november 2018 i think because it was delayed from october wasn't it yeah this thing was mad it was super super overpowered but he got a nerf pretty quick but everyone was using it and everyone was playing the support class because you can only get it on the support class i don't want to be killed by that tank i'm trying to get in the hangar here and do some infantry fighting that would be preferable got some nice recall on it though a little bit of horizontal bounce there but not bad to control with the old pull down on the mouse i didn't get the follow-up character the revive never mind we'll go this way instead cheeky little slide put the ammo down and we are good to go now i went to see the batman earlier guys the new movie i'm a huge batman fan ever since i was a wee lad running around in my batman pajamas and batman knitted jumper that my grandma made for me yep that's a real thing used to watch the animated series all the time then started reading the graphic novels and of course seeing all the movies now the new movie hasn't been a standalone batman movie for ages right is there a res there don't you dare put that dynamite okay i've got to be careful here so i just i watched the first trailer when that came out which felt like 2020 because it was delayed lowe's wasn't it and then uh covered happened you're really going to repeat that anyway so i only watched the first trailer and i thought right i'm in and i like matries stuff i love the other movies what the the hell there's an m3 in that corridor i really love the other movies that matt reeves has worked on and i just got a good vibe about it and i know that everyone memed on robert patterson when it was announced that he was going to be batman because a lot of people my goodness have this preconceived notion that he was in twilight and that's it but i think he's actually a pretty decent actor there's a couple of movies that i've watched one called good time and another called the lighthouse and you know he's really got some decent acting chops on him there's another guy in front of me here can i stick that i don't know maybe ruined but yeah he was just absolutely great in it and the movie itself it's nearly three hours long and for some people you know maybe you look at that and going that's far too long but it just flew by for me and i didn't feel like there was a second of time wasted or any unnecessary scenes anything like that also it is a it's a bit of a murder mystery like a detective style film and of course batman is supposed to be the greatest detective so leaning into that angle we've never really seen much of that in the movies so i really appreciate that there's some beautiful cinematography in it the soundtrack just just awesome i loved it i thought it was great so if you're on the fence about going to see it it gets my recommendation five out of five bananas from me we are losing that point but also hang on i'm just gonna i'm gonna do one more batman thing you know it explores elements of the character that we again we haven't really had in movies before and i don't want to say much more than that because it will be spoilers and i don't want to be that guy you know but yeah really good loved it five out of five from me and i'm looking forward to seeing where that goes because i know they're planning to do another two movies with it it's gonna be good it's a good time to be a batman fan i think can i get another stick if i put that down are you gonna give me a stick well maybe you just get one stick guys i've got your ammo i've got you hang on guys i've got ammo i'm the ammo guy look i don't that was rude i don't usually play as support but there's some ammo there if you want it is there a guy just in that corner yeah there is it where did that grenade come from i'm gone oh that's a horrible angle yep not doing that again see if i can get these guys behind here maybe they've moved rez there i don't like this because i know that they're all down that corridor that was stolen let's go see that guy's got dynamite watch out oh my god there's so many infantry there go prone and just beam them for a bit maybe here look i'll tell you what the medics on their team are doing a damn good job i don't want to get flanked here though although i'm not moving because this is really good because i'm actually capturing the point i shoot anyone's legs here what if i just crawl around here i'll see you up there buddy okay okay smoke grenade i'm just becoming the slug that i was always meant to be and there we go we captured it it's definitely something why is it with vehicles that why someone just keeps putting vehicles down here you know what screw your vehicle that's not a vehicle you can drive is it jack you would it yeah i'm happy with that because we've got sea back and we did something good the dead guy there there's two prone guys there right on the hill they were trying to take out that tank weren't they i see what they were up to being sneaky that's an enemy oh you know this isn't a bad spot actually here can catch everyone running up like that see a nice little head glitch as well love that there's so many steve st who do i aim at what are we looking at lads is there an enemy did you get that's a grenade yeah there's an enemy oh my god that's the vehicle just turned up i've got the stick though you want some of this where'd you go oh they're on the tower there look at this thing i'm so dead all nighter stay here that's an enemy isn't it stick stick stick yes stick you're gonna get it bang i love that thing i'm so glad they put that in the game before the production stopped on everything game lagged a bit then when i killed that dude spotting player of course there's a spotting player there's always too many is it darth vader is it the batman i don't know i'm just gonna shoot anyway it seems like that's what everyone's doing oh rockets as well okay oh god watch out watch out where is that guy flamethrower look at the race don't worry it's a slow one what is good what it's all mangled and crazy it's fine maybe there's a vehicle there i don't know i'm gonna go out here and have a look careful yeah there is there's a stag hound out there i wonder if we can get around the back of it hit it with a stick and then die usually what happens when i use the stick that's why you need the dynamite hello steve oh he's reloading i'm reloading everyone's reloading hip fire is nice on this k7 anyone else there was someone else oh he's made short work of those thank you for having my back i appreciate you and love you lots like vodka shots should we go to b team let's go to b beautiful shorts look at that oh baby that's going to hurt your knees isn't it should have been paying attention i was looking at the ladies shorts apparently my squad just like shooting at things this is what we do we just shoot into smoke what is it what do you see tell me what your raven i see oh someone's on the point you know there's still hello there's still 24 000 peak players on steam playing this every day that's nuts isn't it and you think you've also got other platforms that it's on like origin is it on epic games as well maybe it is use code jack frags by the way got him so there's a lot of people playing this game still and console as well i think i'll be loads on xbox especially is that a guy there i'm just seeing things yeah i'm seeing things and someone just fired at me okay one guy here was it you you're not dead someone's shooting me in the back i'm dead kill that i think the guy that i shot was throwing a grenade and then the grenade became my grenade and then well you just saw what happened didn't you so the less we say about that the better really really not a big fan of these sanctioner they're pushing this objective hard that was an easy kill that an enemy tank yes it is there's one there one there the only thing i've been doing this game is running away from tanks okay infantry pushing in i can help with that i'm helping i'm helping thanks for shooting at me oh thanks for nothing whoa my body there crazy damn they might win this you know they might turn it around look at the score they've got a b c d and f we're barely holding on to e man what are these guys doing here at spawn we're gonna get spawn trapped here i think it's chalked is that an artillery strike as well on this point and they're really using their callings effectively here aren't they that's rv one isn't it yeah i think that was a friendly v1 coming in there so maybe we can push the d you want ammo yeah there's so many on this point oh my god right there dead i think he's dead yeah this is going to come down to the wire i didn't expect it to i thought we had this one easy maybe if we take that right hand blank instead because they're just so focused on d here trying to push over this side but they're actually oh they've taken e oh my goodness they're gonna win this aren't they they're gonna turn it around beamdom love that is this safe no there's gonna be a tank yeah i knew it called it we've almost won we're about to lose i guess i could just put some pressure on c bring him back i don't know i'm spied now there's a little squad pushing up here got that sniper that was shooting at me that's another tank ow let's go just gotta try they've really barricaded this up as well look no one on the point okay this could be a good distraction but look how close it is this is coming down to the wire i'll go right to the back here you might not expect me okay we got c that's good that's something at least watch your back also watch your back ow they've actually spawned over there to come back and defend it i'm impressed ah they're pushing c now i actually think they're going to win it that was a really nice comeback there from the enemy team hopefully that guy doesn't slam me hello i see someone else just shoot there behind me tank please leave me alone the whole game dude let's
