look at this warzone global leader boards for pc second place gonna get banned 45 000 kills 37.5 kill death ratio 45 average kills per match how is this possible guy down here q 39 000 kills 26.74 kd 36 average kills per game why are these people not banned i don't know but i think it's time that we look into this a bit more hi everyone hope you're all doing well and enjoying your weekend today's video is sponsored by zotac and nvidia zotac have released an awesome bit of kit with the geforce rtx 2060 super mini it's a compact graphics card that fits 99 of systems giving you 1080p 144 fps performance in warzone in a small form factor along with the added features of geforce rtx like real-time ray tracing and dlss it also features zotak's ice storm 2.0 cooling hardware to keep your gpu quiet cool and able to sustain stronger overall performance and i'm sure you guys know this already but there are some huge benefits to playing a game like warzone at higher frame rates and monitor hurts it feels and looks smoother as you can see and higher frame rates do in fact give you less input lag too check out the link in the description below if you're interested in learning more about the zotac rtx 2060 super mini in your region okay then so today's video was going to be about how cod warzone players are buying new copies of modern warfare on brand new accounts so they can avoid skill based matchmaking but also cheaters now i find the debate around skill based matchmaking really interesting some people think that it doesn't even exist but with my own and others experiences playing this game i can personally say that with 99 accuracy there is some form of skill based matchmaking in cod warsaw and i understand why a system like that is in the game but at the same time i understand why some people don't like it and think that it ruins the game to a certain degree and the reason i'm telling you this is that the context of skill based matchmaking being in the game is the main reason why people think creating new accounts will stop them playing against cheaters so the theory goes that if you're an above average player or a good player that's got a decent kill death ratio in warzone you've played quite a few games you've won a few matches and so your skill rating will be quite high compared to most of the other people playing the game and therefore you are much more likely to be put in lobbies with cheaters because they might also be in the top five to ten percent of players and of course if you're cheating in war zone you've probably got an insane kill death ratio on stats and inevitably cheaters get through the net and they end up in lobbies that are full of the majority of people not cheating but who are just good but of course when you throw a cheater in there with an aimbot and a wall hack most of the time they're going to win and it's going to be a really frustrating experience for everyone else in that game that's the theory so to get around that you buy a new copy of modern warfare or you register a new free account of warzone and you assign a different phone number to that because remember you have to do that now with free accounts so you log into blizzard load up warzone you then have to make a new activision account and away you go now at this point in time on a new account you've essentially got a clean slate there are no stats for warzone on your account so how could the game possibly assign you a skill rating and know your true skill well the answer is that it can't and so you will be placed in war zone lobbies with other new players and players of a lower skill rating which usually means no cheaters so for a few matches you can have a great time outclassing the competition and also avoid getting 180 trickshotted beamed through a 15 story building from the ground floor when you stand at the roof by someone using an aimbot hey you're having a great time but then all of a sudden after about five or six games you've got a skill rating and now you're going to be put back in those higher skill potential cheetah lobbies this is a temporary fix and if you wanted to do this all of the time you would have to keep making new accounts whether that's spending money on the game over and over again or making free accounts and you've just got a load of phone numbers you can use so it would be a pain to do this all the time but it's a solution that people think would keep cheaters out of their games so this morning when i got up i tried this i bought a new account of modern warfare zero kills on warzone zero matches all i did was play the multiplayer until i'd got to level 8 so i could unlock the three perks that i use eod overkill and amped and i also bought the white growl that you can get in the store at the moment because it's pretty much the metagrow and also the purple growl pack that comes with the mp7 so i at least had some guns that i was used to when i was playing how did it go then well the first few matches were relaxing i would say that's the best way of putting it and i don't mean this in a bad way to diminish anyone else playing the game because look it's cod warzone it's a casual game you're not playing for millions of dollars or anything it's just supposed to be fun and ultimately for me people can play however they like whenever they like as much as they want as long as they're not cheating the biggest takeaway for me was that most of the firefights i was having i never felt any pressure i never felt like i was going to lose and i was playing stimulus duos here so most of the time it was a 1v2 against me and when you've played fps multiplayer games for a while you can just tell what kind of opponent you're up against almost instantly based on their movement based on how many shots they're hitting on you how much are they missing have they got teammates that are doing the same thing and flanking you are they employing any tactics or is it just a case of i'm hiding in the corner hoping that this guy runs in front of me and i kill them compare that to the experience on my normal account and every firefight is super competitive teams are aggressively pushing you flanking buying uavs hunting for players and if i'm not taking things really seriously and if i'm not using the meta weapons then i'm probably going to be losing quite a few gunfights so for me it was a night and day difference playing on this new account so in that respect if you want a few easier games before you get your skill racing this is how you would do it but i just want you guys to answer a question how many matches do you think i played before i was killed by a cheater have a guess right now down in the comments below how many games did it take before captain aimbot showed up and don't cheat either pun intended okay that's enough time seven matches it took seven matches before this happened boom oh hello and fight i think there's one more here where is he what that felt really weird okay there it is oh i mean i think that guy's cheating i'm gonna try and win the goo lag and go back there it's not way too quick right okay where was he let's pull me all the way over here well i'm going back to promenade then is that him cheer shoot me come on i'm here kill me kill me thank you oh 100 100 that's ain't bottom no recall let's see who else is there that they ruin what is he doing i was a glimp there yeah that's 100 artificial is aimbot broken or something maybe he's just got bad ping he's like shooting behind people and they're dying what i think he sees someone i didn't even see that guy no he's off to the buy station don't get the fire sale spend all your money there's a car coming i feel sorry for this guy oh just turned around yes well played the cheetah was killed by king cereal king cereal you're a legend unless you're also cheating i don't think you are uh well i mean that's the weakness of the cheater it seems buy stations seven games that's all it took and that guy was level 155 got camos on his guns and everything i'm just baffled by this really the last i want to say three to four weeks have been really bad for cheaters seen so many clips so many people complaining about it myself personally i've noticed an influx of cheaters in my games and it sucks and i thought you know what if that guy can get to level 155 cheating so obviously then what else is there so that took me to what you saw at the start of the video the leaderboards look at this this is a guy from the start of the video second on the leaderboard for kills 45 000 average kills per game 45 why has this guy not been manually banned or why is there not some kind of statistics based anti-cheat looking at this and going well this guy is obviously cheating let's ban him this dude again 26.7 kd 36 average kills there's so many in here it's ridiculous this guy may night 17.5 kd ratio 29 average kills per game obviously cheesing and you scroll down there's so many that are obvious this guy look 21.37 kd 28 average kills 31 000 kills how do you get 45 000 kills when you're obviously cheating and not get banned 45 000 kills guys no one no one is looking at this manually i can guarantee that if they just employed one person to just look at this list and just go obviously a cheater right click you're banned sorry why isn't that happening i don't understand just for some perspective huskers here probably one of the best war zone players in the world 5.1 kd ratio 11 kills per game 39 000 kills dude's an absolute monster he plays all the time he streams if you want to go and check him out as well that's a legit profile right there one of the best players in the world has got a 5.1 kd and yet these guys are not manually banned i don't understand why not man i could go on about this all day infinity war did put out a statement a couple days ago saying that they are doing things to stop cheaters and there's another bandwave coming but i don't know if it's enough like i feel like something has to change like restructure the way that you're looking at things because it's been really bad the last few weeks especially as a pc player with lots of pc players in their lobby and it will massively hurt the game if it continues to go on like this i know that it must be really hard to stay on top of this but other free-to-play games with cross-platform have done well to stop cheating fortnite for example whatever they did it seems to have worked i just don't want to see this game tarnished because of some people who don't want to play fair i have to be honest there's been a few times where i've been killed by cheetah and i've just quit for the day it's so deflating and i did say way back in the original video maybe temporarily one of the best things that they could do in the meanwhile while they're trying to get a handle on this in order to protect the vast majority of the player base which is on console is to let console players disable cross-play with pc players it's difficult to do it on playstation and you get long matchmaking times xbox players just can't do it surely you've got enough console players between the xbox and playstation that you could stop pc players getting into their games for a little while until you're sure that the cheating is calming down a bit i think maybe that's just the best thing to do for the majority of the player base at the moment but i don't know man it's frustrating sometimes but there it is moral of the story no matter what you do create a new account you might avoid skill-based matchmaking for a bit but you're going to run into a cheetah real soon i hope they can get a lid on it soon anyway because i do really have fun with this game with that said do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys what has your experience been like recently with cheetahs with that said leave a like if you enjoyed the video a dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
