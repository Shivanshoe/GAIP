it's thursday and you know what that means it's the one day a week that i play battlefield 2042 for the weekly mission there was some news about the future of battlefield with the e8 earnings call yesterday as well so we're gonna be talking about that too not much but something this week it might look like a sniper rifle but it's not it's for a weapon skin called deflect that can be used on every weapon and i don't think they've done that before we've got to revive 15 teammates that's a doddle resupply 50 teammates with ammo have to take an ammo crate and inflict 3 000 damage with primary and secondary weapons not too bad but is there a little jet there look at that why is that there reminds me of micro machines when i was a kid you ever have micro machines like little tiny vehicles you know i've barely used the wildcat is it actually good he's instantly played that okay that's not a bad start to my wildcat adventures i'll take it bit of damage there towards the assignment as well i am playing as angel because i feel like with angel i can easily give out ammo i can easily revive just feels like a good fit for the challenge right mate okay so if we weren't going to get him with the gun it was going to be the roadkill there's a man there's a man here it's pretty decent that gun oh that's a tank okay hey boris boris how did that not get you did i not just run you over boris really i've got to go for the kill i see more infantry ah damn it you want some of this how about that how about that you like that don't you oh yeah yeah look at that press the button right we're gonna take a trip to the top of the roof it's gonna be great you ready instantly gone pro this is a good strat are we going back down are we what about the roof we have to be on the roof now we go back up okay and we stay there we stay you want to go prone again oh you throw that oh my god they were right all along you should have just said the bob guys you won't want ammo don't you look at this little squad here ammo what are you looking at what are you looking at ammo more ammo for you or a res i can you you need help ammo can someone please count how many times i say ammo in this video make sure it's accurate as well oh there's a rest there's a res yes that's good that counts oh i was going to go for the res on b1 and b2 let's go there let me spotted yes rapid fire yes this gun is nuts and i love it there's a little head there little head glitch come on run here run here let's go there's another one isn't it one more round there [Applause] good lads well done ammo ammo you need ammo you just used some so you need some surely all right mate kinky tail that's cheeky that's a bloody tornado you want some you like some of that yeah you want some of that okay tornado revive oh you're an enemy that's fine what okay i thought it was the tornado it was just a smoke grenade there was a guy hiding in it now is the same thing going to happen that happened before there's just going to be let's guess two boris turrets one ranger three infantry wow i'm actually surprised at that i thought i was done for oh he's rushing wow another one there the explosion what the hell was that they pushed over i think i actually did get one of the parts of the weekly mission there right enemy here it's a really bad place to go pro hell is that an enemy bolty that just rocked up i can res i can res no you're giving up dolphin diving battlefield i mean they used to do that a lot in bf2 but not in many of the recent games they're actually attacking this point hard i'm surprised is that giving point better play i've got some cover there with the bolty the tower's falling down as well which is interesting doesn't usually happen there's another guy here somewhere where where are you i'm so dead i'm dead i'm dead okay maybe not if i get away how am i alive how did i survive that for a nade oh it didn't kill anyone serious no the osprey is gonna get me what if i just go prone here and hide i'm just gonna i'm just gonna prone here this is fine surely they're still alive there what if i need there okay a red hit marker but nothing came up put him in the turret okay i'm dead i'm dead damn it there's a guy behind me now oh man i did not have any right to survive as long as i did then how did i manage to stay alive that long that was so lucky okay that counts go pro get out of there get out of there please there's a bully there ow what if i call in a vaulty of my own a counter bolty as long as it doesn't crush me nice infantry here clear die seven people apparently there's seven people that's terrible i can hear them am i possibly supposed to kill seven people i got rest there's two i'm gonna get flanked aren't i seven too many maybe for me i think we're actually gonna lose this one as well wheatley missions what was that i got another one then but that wasn't the unlock there's still one to do hello thank you little parachute headshot there i love that oh cheeky little flank as well i can't stop saying cheeky guys there's something wrong with me try ranger oh i can't stand rangers please just making like support or something damn it oh we lost i think i made some good progress there though check in a second okay so i did the resupply i did the damage i've just got to provide 10 teammates then we'll get it that should be easy right okay i've switched to breakthrough because 10 revives on this should be an absolute doddle just because everyone is so bunched up together it should be easy okay there's one countdown with me guys okay number two boy i'm trying to get my revised can i do that one i'm gonna try number three yes i mean this is just chaos i don't know why anyone would ever want to play breakthrough 128 players it just doesn't work 64. it's all right like where's the tactics in this or anything how can you even make sense of anything look it's just it's just craziness isn't it absolutely crazy okay you why not why not i'm not gonna die and that's number four there it is but the balti and please i steal that one that's number five five alive okay sundance okay you keep doing you you know oh how was that double were there two people there must have been this will be number six i'm stabbing him i didn't mean to do that four more to go i'm not looking that way number seven there you go never turned around and it's not there what's happening here are you facing the wrong way dozer oh god wait number eight there it is whoa whoa oh my god look at the amount of enemies here i need a suppressor or something this is insane it's just a tree that's my protection it's this small tree i don't know how i survived that again another situation like that where i just i should be dead another res another res could have done it i wanted the res okay there's two there maybe i don't know not possible okay two here one and then here oh oh there's so many there okay someone res me and i'll rest someone else last one surely look at all these friendlies he's not a single person here gonna res me yes last one boom there it is that should be it eleven yes fleck unlocked cool all right we'll go to the other side in the menu afterwards i can't just walk in there i think that's fine i mean i might as well defend this last objective now i'll try to i guess jeez some kind of c4 here would be absolutely insane and hold mouse one to win yep that's whole mouse one to win right there can i drop a vehicle on their heads like that is going to drop on their heads did that even work i don't know i did drop in and i'm going to try something stupid sorry is this real did i just get away with that that's so dumb not a single person shot me now you see i've just realized that there's 440 tickets remaining and i am not about to play that many tickets so you know what we're going to do we're going to see if we can get a cheeky backrage on the go and then we're just going to call it quits and we'll take a look at this game there's someone just there just firing a gun yeah there is look at this okay here we go this is the back raise this is it and that's it three kills is that a back rage doesn't really count look at this why am i allowed to be here this doesn't seem fair look i'm just on this tiny little lip no i've fallen i can't get up don't kill me don't kill me gopro gopro go prone no right we'll go check out the skin there it is fleck and we could put it on anything i think let's see how it looks on some guns hey i'm ready nobody's ready angel go away what's my favorite gun in this game mp9 maybe fleck can't really see it very well on that can you what's it look like on the lcmg hardware appearance and of course a bit difficult to see what about like uh sniper rifle dxr yeah it's not amazing is it i mean it's definitely not as interesting or as cool as the helmet from last week or the sniper rifle from the week before but there it is that's this week's reward thank you for watching guys hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one i just realized that i totally forgot to go over the earnings call while i was playing so we're gonna do it quickly now at the end battlefield was only mentioned like once or twice they didn't really talk about it much at all and they said something like that they're looking at it from a long-term perspective they said it's one of the great franchises in the industry and they also said that they've got like a good leadership team now and they're rethinking the development process from the ground up whatever that means and also that they're using the vince zampella respawn model to get to the phone as quickly as possible blah blah blah they said there's still more work to do the team is committed to doing the work for the community and then it was like beyond that they'll get to a place where they feel like they're in the right condition with the core experience of the game and then expected to grow beyond where the game is today who knows what any of that means but it's a little tidbit at least i wanted to mention okay i'm actually going now bye
