hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty warzone today i'm going to be using the new cdl pro loadouts that have just dropped in the store because i thought you know they use these for competitive cod which is typically like small scale it's not really war zone but what wanted to see like how would they fare in war zone so the skins are pretty cool for them one of them is an m4 and one of them is an hdr now i have changed one thing on the hdr i'll show you guys in a second so as for the m4 that's the build no stock i don't think i've used that before so i'm quite interested to see how the gun handles but they've also got the grip tape on as well i wouldn't usually put that on and the compensator i mean there i'd probably put a monolithic spreader it's the pretzel suppressor for warzone but i'm gonna stick with that build just to see how it is in war zone and the hdr i did change a couple things here um i'll just show you guys so i put the monolithic on and i took the bipod off i think i also put the attack laser on i like the skins a lot really cool but today we're going to be playing with study and vic star and also the content today is sponsored by nvidia and pc specialist and i'm just going to show you guys a quick little video that i've put together talking about high frame rates and high monitor hurts today's content is sponsored by nvidia and pc specialist we'll be playing warzone using an rtx 2080 ti graphics card to achieve as many frames per second as possible high fps in multiplayer shooters can make the experience feel a lot nicer for you especially when you team it with a 144hz or 240hz monitor as you can see in the video here filmed using a super expensive 1000 fps camera higher frame rates and hurts will give you a smoother look and feel to the gameplay the difference from 60 to 144hz is huge and in my opinion it's one of the biggest improvements that you can make to your pc gaming setup higher frame rates also equal less input lag and that's one of the most important things for me so if you're interested in checking out rtx cards to learn more about this or pc specialist for custom builds there's a link down in the description below we'll also be giving away two lots of 2 400 cod points for pc throughout the duration of this stream and dropping them in the chat so there we go big thanks to nvidia and pc specialist for sponsoring this one and with that said we're gonna try and get into a game with the boys i may have noticed something too on that hdr build let me just check this yeah i've got a spare slot on there don't i could put focus or fully loaded hmm go focus we'll go with that like i said the m4 build though that is exactly the same i haven't touched that right like i said 2 400 cod points as well twice during the stream look out for him all right you boys ready hello i don't quite think the guys are ready yet welcome to the stream everyone yeah i'll put focus on them mozza chrissy t we all just want to play video games see if i can get vic in the party where is starting all right let's get this all right vic how you doing very good good stuff oh you're for playing today you want to do normal trios of stimulus stimulus all the way okay i love i love it have you played much of it i've not played stimulus trailers at all oh you're in for a treat i've heard it's pretty action-packed yeah it's good it's good especially if you like chain up a few contracts to the squad then you just don't have to worry about like getting to those buy stations to rest it's just like it just happens which is nice infinite respawns mm-hmm a good few hours uh yes than the day before what's your highest kill i got i got a 30. i got a 30 kill game uh day before yesterday we're trying we're trying to step up on that a little bit it's quite fun like a lot of the time if you wipe a squad with money they all just come straight back down to try and get that loot just doubles the kills for free they want revenge yeah always but i think it's quite nice because players don't seem to camp quite as much because if they have the money to respawn they're not quite so worried yeah just which is a good thing a good thing indeed um i will join up on your lobby and we will await the story starred meister i don't see him online he's engaged in his intro he's focused let me see no i don't see him online either what's your take on the foul then i've heard people saying it's the new it's a new go-to gun is is up to yeah like 19 30 meters it's unreal like the time to kill is crazy but at the same time hello hey there's this boy at the same time i think like super close and smg still wins out mm-hmm i don't know it's uh no the smg's just i'm guessing you're talking about the foul versus mp yeah yeah it's reliable yeah yeah reliable easily you don't have to worry about like dealing with random recoil just spray oh jack you probably want to lock your party again do you have some sort of thing that stops people from joining you jack well is there a setting that i'm missing somewhere i think it's in battle net it's in battle now yeah that on that oh you might have just saved saved me whereas i assume you've done it all for the uh in-game account settings right yeah yeah yeah you're an absolute i can kick these guys get him out ah oh my sorry i'm sorry jack i'm just gonna leave this this time okay profile settings edit profile ah uh friends only and then link visibility friends only that's what i want isn't it i think that's a.m oh you should you've saved me i couldn't work it out no more big star one two three four oh mardi gras joining the lobby well i sent your name perfect matt thank you for the turn that's very kind of sweat classic music what have you got on the menu i think i'm going i'm going for that kilo vic kilo mp5 you know can i interest you in the bruin mk9 if i can unlock it i still haven't yeah and now now i'm ruined so i'm never gonna unlock it why are you ruined because i i i can't do uh shoot the ship so it's over yeah it's over i'm ruined you can back in and out of matches though so it's not too bad yeah it probably take me like two hours i reckon i want to do it i mean the three kills in smoke right yeah but you just kind of run up some throw it on the floor and spray do that three times back out cue again it shouldn't take you two hours maybe take you an hour i got it in about 45 minutes in shipment okay i think i'll i'll think about it but yeah i will i will try the brew and i will try the brown one what's up kelly it is this is this is spicy it's my my favorite it's my go-to thank you burger pants right for like sniping right right now this first win in general it's just it is my ar now the lmg is the new ar the way it be i don't know why it has like a higher headshot multiplayer than like all the other guns in the game like all the ars have like 35 and it has 42 damage on the headshot is that because it's an lmg like i guess yeah it's a bit harder but then once you like put the fast clip on it it has the mobility of an ar something like that yeah i played a little bit i mean let's see is uh it's something it's like supercharged warzone supercharged warsaw like if you're hanging around the police station you end up with like three groups dropping on each other all right rush that loadout yeah someone asked me to put the fps yeah it's just like drop instantly get your loadout you guys are down yeah you gotta you gotta you gotta win those pistol fights there yeah i don't know i don't know what it's like now but we were getting shots pretty much one of these pistols from day one okay yeah we'll just go for would you go for like a hot drop though like sometimes but we can we can we can shoot somewhere i dragged a little bit drop in get straight on that loadout maybe and then we're big chilling jonathan thank you for becoming a new member and shane thank you for the 20 that's very kind matt i hope you're feeling better by the way all right what do we do with this oh we got m4 hdr today let's do this and there's a couple shops around it depends how crazy we want to start this like we couldn't go superstar we could go there no i'm down for twins twins yeah i'm about it i'm just like i feel like that's just far enough away for it not to be congested directly on the shot yeah so we just drop in pull our money get plates and a loadout you just wanna do that straight away can uh can we fair i guess i guess we could just drop normally well we could go here as well i swear people less people go to that one okay let's go hotel then yes and if and if that one's busy then we can just go further on so they'll stop right behind it good deal i guess we don't particularly need to get that feel like that yet instantly there's someone already on it i'll go for it he's just one guy as far as i can see there huh he's running he's running he knows he knows he just started running jack's coming straight back we've got a little bit of his cash we just need like 200 more i just heard i mean we'll be able to lose it around here right surely yeah i've got cash there you go let's go cool uh i've got one more chest to get and i'll be over okay i'll drop something cash on yeah wait there's someone here no some cash in here yeah trophy there's a trophy here as well in case we need it below it's got more characters very nice nice where's this going all right it's loadout wars then that's this game right yeah literally it's only got the 30 round mag in it this m4 i had a game the other day where i just did bounty off the bounty off the bounty yeah i enjoyed your thumbnail it was good little throwback culture straight masterpiece this team looks like they might be pushing yeah 2 30 or from the other shop yeah on the way i might have to change the mag in this i didn't realize it was a 30 mag down to one nice okay that's what's wiped pretty good mobility though another one dropping

sooner we can just get a couple bounties in then we don't have to worry about dying so is the wave you think someone will beat world record with this game mark oh yeah actually not the like they'll beat the trio's record for sure i've already seen one of my friends squads got 105. i think their trio's record before this was 108. so but i don't think they'll actually break the quads record they need stimulus quads i think to break that what's the stimulus what's the quadratic 300 players yeah 200 player stimulus quads would be the way because i haven't seen anyone yet get over 105 on here yeah what's the kill count for quads the record uh 138 cheers yeah i don't think anything like that will ever happen again i i've gone for it a couple of times since and never broken like 120. yeah it's too far in the game now i think yeah everyone everything yeah dropping in as well standing nice there's a fight over there grabbing some plates in there thank you he's gone in there i think okay

tagged one he's down there finish that got him one more good job hold on let's go boy great game this is stimulus upside down now sauron this will be a video afterwards yeah you get to enjoy me saying the pretzel at the start rather than suppressor it reminds me of paintball this game mode in a good way ggs i thought it was going to be one of those toxic end games but what do you mean what the hell just start screaming all right i'm quite respectful i love a little gg in the post game thank you sauron thank you matt fire striker what's up oh yeah dude i need to change the magdalene actually you know what i'm going to stick with the 30. i'm going to stick with it because it seems to be mountain people though just got to be careful with the reload my monitor what's up let's get us back in there it's the ben q 240 hertz what your thoughts then jack excel something it's cool man yeah it's really fun it's uh it's just very aggressive gameplay it's like a goo lag but you can't lose which is always nice because we've all been on the receiving end of a tough gulag many a tough guru like a couple rocks from the side yeah it's a benq xl 24 240 hertz it's the one that's got hdmi 2.0 after this is over i'm going to go and unlock the bruin in your honor i respect that he's vic vic in the gun shop dude i can't believe they've not done creative codes for this shirt seems like a no-brainer they don't need to they've made what how how many like 800 million or something on micro transactions so far i'm really hoping they do like um more custom cosmetics like they've got like the custom weapon decals so they're like pro it'd be cool if they started doing stuff for like youtubers yeah it'd be nate you're a little charm that'd be cool yeah a little star the big star one two three intro what what would your charm be i think mine would be a star that's a no-brainer yeah uh that could be a frag yeah surely right or would it or if you haven't yet i don't know i think it would be uh it would either be the logo or it would be like a little megalodon or something like a little shark oh yeah it's true but i don't know that's a rival company a fragile just inspired by jaws really i just love sharks i love big sharks all right i think it's time to open auntie let's get in the airfield was it carlos what would yours be start headshot uh yeah be a bit boring really just something generic hey gabby how are you doing it's like an s in a sniper scope so i guess you could just rock that yeah or is it scope without the s i don't know i am having a good day hurley thank you let's go without my logo just just nothing they've got logos for the cdl teams don't they so yeah and the custom skins and everything like color schemes yeah i reckon they'd allow it for content creators yeah that would be cool i reckon i've sold about fifty thousand cdl some weapons big we got some sweaty boys in the airfield now you can't dodge that man one down there there's another one in there so what box boy one further back one further back i'm watching for his peep oh there you go that's the team good job that snipes dude yeah i got a little little hdr off the floor uh loadout you're nuts yeah let's do it yes uh oh these guys will be coming straight back i forgot about that oh come here i'm alive i'm alive i'm live he's in the last hangar yeah i'm going with your peaks and i'll go better behind me there's one behind me is it actually at the plane yeah i've hit him i hit him yeah we're kind of sandwiched i'm covering it why did we put the load out in the middle of the airfield we had no choice because all right we were already going to die there i down shield boy there's a guy here and then you got the people behind oh man i mean that loadout could try and get it yeah look we wanted to give other people a chance just come and fresh off the wind we didn't want to do it how to make it dramatic you know give them some slack real i mean what mac is what mode is it mcnees it is stimulus trios so if you have four thousand five hundred dollars on you you respawn that is the tough thing you wipe your squad you go for the loadout that's what's coming back who picks up the riot shield man is that what he did yeah because i went around the corner to finish him and he's like oh yeah good right shield sorry yeah thank you pubg brawler it's one of the one of the most confusing weapons in the game we did a crossbow only challenge and we were destroying people because we had three right shields and crossbows we've taken it in turns like the roman army just pull up the shields cross first and if you put the explosive bolts so it one times people yeah i've seen that but isn't it a little bit is it it's not 100 accurate is it it's like slightly off is that right slightly off but it's it won't make you miss anything more than like 30 meters i mean the trap i'm so long after that it doesn't really can't hit anyway but um yeah it was just funny because you just people just when you pull up like two shields people are scared to run at you do that rightly so that was a funny day we won our first game of the day crossbow only and then for the next hour we couldn't win with normal guns like something's not right loadout based skill match sorry loadout skill based matchmaking maybe do conspiracy and uh no i didn't see anyone now she's in the cross though oh man that fire is fast oh this renee that's sick sounds cool cody thank you for the five you're digging stim trios that's good uh trollion thank you for becoming a member i've not really used the ebr in war zone jerry okay we're two this time i don't know if it's viable but some of you are back in that same area someone asked in the chat uh hdr or ax50 hdr for me every time x50 is cool but i just hdr's so easy to use magnus you just got your first ever pc congrats man what's up anxious how you doing i'm surprised that last drop was as busy as it was it's the airfields if they were they were getting closed on you hmm this long is gonna have a lot of people in it maybe we should land far side just yeah got ourselves situated yeah this is super busy again although it's i mean less people a silo shop at least yeah i'm in vic's house hey hey you're in the wrong one what i thought this is the biggest house this is my house then he's waiting to get his bounty got some quick start account what is that shotgun man hmm so shut there is a shot there yeah they're just fighting over there again they're getting the loadout over there yeah i think they're they're going to go for the shop they're going to go for their bounties right now stay on there yeah i got uav okay let's see if we reckon we can maybe catch him napping once they get their load out here yeah i i'm going to keep running along and then catch them off the the side when there's a little racecourse i have been spotted i'm pretty sure but i'm not afraid not afraid they haven't gone to the shop yet weirdly no they they they know i'm here one down no one's pushing trying to get a bit closer one round yeah one's uh one's on the floor in between the building and it's down friend yeah he's on the other side of the building as well they've both gone back in so there's one down that side and then two in the building i can gas grenade it up and down ready let's go running through the back running through the back that's cute oh my god i'll buy a loadout and then you guys can just stop me some cash no we can invest yes grenade doesn't actually do damage does it no it just it makes you vehicle trucking coming from uh airport get your loadouts a bit of cash to recall no dropped about through there there you go do you need more stud if i want to buy some plates yeah wow we could get your view well i'll drop you a bit more if you want to get uav as well still yeah watch out jack you've gone under budget there that's fine jax he's been probably he knows he knows nothing could go wrong all right let's go push the team here one down long time to jump my friend no no no no oh is that someone landed us someone slamming us okay beamed him pretty hard though come on peek again no armor is he on his own yeah yeah it looks like it saturated jack i've got one thanks might be worth just leaving this guy and going back towards the action off north yeah that makes sense that building is my absolute least favorite you drop me a bit of cash yeah there you go thank you the bank of big star i expect uh 25 repayment what's the interest on 25 hey teresa hey dylan how you doing yeah i see one guy out front of super why watch hd ask in it is it it's the new cdl ones the pro low notes a guy at the top there on orange [Applause] we could take the back ladder here i've got a dead silence so i can go first all right there's at least two on the roof yeah can reload if my math is correct when you want to have someone slide above me yeah slightly boy yeah all right if you just give me a bit of time to just get out with dead silence hopefully i don't die oh wait he's watching one's watching there's a truck come in watch out okay let's not push up there they're just watching the ladder yeah let's just go back to airfield they have to leave um definitely super just playing with the circle we should get over this field asap i might even pull up the truck to the end here yeah that's fine do you hear jump in the back yeah truckstar123 oh you got the waifu wagon i love it it's a fellow wifey wagon reverses at the speed of slack so quick he's watching that ladder that's an easy sniper you can't get this

gotta unlock it and do the movie you can start leveling up before you uh unlock it which will save you i mean i'll do it if you don't understand okay i will change your life i'm ready for it there you go the 3x on it yeah it actually reduces the recoil statistically it reduces the recoil having that that like uh like merc foregrip increases movement speed yeah it's just one of those hidden weird things which doesn't make sense because it's like a more enhanced optic so i don't know why that is a thing but yeah i just you know give everyone a bonus just odd things bush life i knew it was the bush always the bush you'd think it would be the opposite like you'd get like it would be harder to use more magnified scopes but andrew thank you for the 10 that's very kindly i'll go and get a uv my favorite gun is the famas edward i don't think so thomas is not the one okay squad behind us that one guy on the bridge yeah three guys on the ball oh yeah okay nice we can go we're already over now

okay okay right you want c4s for that jack if you put [Music] that's another good guy though that was a good game man why is the message there load up got time for one more movie yeah yeah that was uh yeah it's not it's not great hanging out a sniper as far as synergies go it's fun you down a lot of people but then you can't finish them you hear that jack what he did he didn't have it he said the real jack frags nice videos no sometimes like i have it turned on it doesn't work i don't know i think we've got something wrong in my sense maybe maybe like check facts not real close but no cigar indeed duke i'm indeed got some nice snipes in that game at least yeah i think i need you need the bigger mag don't you with that 50 rather than 60 actually no 60s 60s the one yeah that build is really good i don't know if it's as good in warzone though i feel like it's a multiplayer build because you're finding much longer ranges in warzone tyron you can do it i'm playing at 1080p i'm upscaling the stream to 40 because you get better quality but i'm upgrading my internet connection this year i'm going to get a gig line and then i'm going to stream like 4k at 30 mbps i'm just going to look sick on youtube i can't wait for that i think that whole game went wrong when my recon my c4 drone got stuck in the window and it just got stuck in it anyway i blame the cursed building that we found oh a weird odin skin oh there's a cool gun it's odin based off a real weapon was it made up i think it is a russian weapon how interesting the hdr is made up isn't it a complete myth hey tempo simon thank you for becoming a member wait was it oh yeah hdr is the only gun that's actually not real apparently [Music] yeah the odin is based on the ash 12. [Music] i think they have it in tarkov jack yeah no no no i think you were like i'm not supposed to have this gun and then you went around and killed everyone with it that's good yeah uh we got one more code to give a giveaway deadly reaper i'm going to try something weird this game of power and uzi with an x50 alireza thank you gotta keep mixing it up imagine if shotguns were actually like the better it was that would be fire shotguns are fun they're not good but they're fun you got you got boys coming in yeah i don't think it would be good um i guess i mean i've got a pee pee ready for that i'll be back one down hold on one end down here as well nice i think there's more upstairs i was fighting at people outside and there's people outside the hangars as oh god that's what you want yep they're just doing me from hangers closing the doors this is horrible goodbye physically and legally closing the door on that job no one rest him more people outside out there i don't think so

been the best a from before yeah by the way vic i was i wasn't even using the best barrel last two rounds and now i've just put on the long barrel this thing's actually broken the kilo oh with the longest barrel and basically all the grow attachments what is that i still i still prefer the burn to it which is really it's good though it's good like it's better than the grout last week i've never seen someone it's a leaf never mind it'd be that way sometime this is a stream candy you're watching a live stream right now on the airfield i don't miss that being done but he didn't even start armor that's probably the team from long i've got to get that load out there yes you still in there i think on his own that's weird it could have been split from his team sniping you from there jack on blue enemy uav over here and then him the guy you see now hey low very low you i'm getting sniped out but i have no idea where i'm from it's from east i think i'm hearing shots east thank you jack huge star behind us hmm see if they had cash oh get back down one guy front of uh fire station looking for the rest i've not seen anyone else for sure he's just clamping front of fire i'm watching his angle he pushes he won't he's pushing especially now yeah crap i can't see him there's snipers are at the shop as well in the airfield on the airfield yeah chop on airfield i feel sniper dead watch the skies are they i feel another finishing your field kill this is one by you big still i think there's one or two important yes uh yeah yeah he's coming he's coming over the road down nice job he's got a teammate somewhere in there okay there's one more i think five thousand yeah find it i hear him here [Music] there was definitely one east he'll be a paratrooper though so he played oh yeah i know he was beaming me with a with a growl actually okay he's probably just landing his gear right tagged do you want to move as a team to this other loadout um and then we can get the bounty to straight up straight there oh that guy filed the fight i tried to mp5 him from far my bad is someone still northwest yeah he's by that shot yeah i feel picky jack i think he's pushing he's pushing outside wall another one the same team like eight times in a row that sniper's still on the airfield still no i don't is that even there for your team i don't know if it is no that's what i'm saying the sniper's still there on the airfield i think yeah i'm gonna go uh get this bounty get the loadout and then we can go shop please maybe might have what you need jeez spooky spooks what's up broken how you doing i don't even know what gun to grab here slaves thank you for the 10. let's go we've got the x50 combo again you can get started by the double sniper yeah literally look at this thing for an lmg i'm sprinting along holding it in one hand yeah it's massive but you can just run so fast i know that's not the look of the bruin it yeah it does look pretty pretty high-tech i'm going for that loadout yeah you say it's safe i think thank you guys no worries so why are we still there he's in that circle somewhere that was a rumor that i was putting a fenton but honestly i don't i don't believe it's true could never be me they couldn't do that and defend stuff no it doesn't work ben star one two three many central's quite nice big time oh jesus christ how is that not a headshot what do you mean what do you mean it's the big guy don't talk about my gun like that did you figure out why i was broke and stuff no it's just it's just it's just not it's broken i just don't like it there's a guy shooting right next to me i just haven't seen him where is he on the thing on top of the thing i don't know why no dude i found him he's like hidden he's like hidden underneath him confused he gets mates around doesn't need the armor dude you can't snipe through that don't land on him and do take down vic yeah you reckon yeah bullying bullying all right i'm about it and before he celebrates he self-righteous and cleans me out he's still there oh he's killed himself no dude i didn't oh you're getting himself he was still up he's he's dead there's one dance there's more people here more people that's not a teamwork though so they're coming back yeah sorry i didn't realize he was down guys let's go for the super airborne assassination i think there was ever a point where you could like jump on someone from up above and do an assassination like in the development of this game like assassin's creed style yeah i don't think activation is brave enough for that kind of that kind of play it probably got really annoying though like imagine think of the ping jack like you oh 100 you just get like randomly choke slammed into the floor they look cool for the content though i mean they might as well now they've got the finger guns i'm telling you anything's possible how do you get the finger guns it just part they were part of the fourth of ju july pack i don't know if that's still available i bet it is yeah i think everything stays pretty available max thank you for the 10. try and get this really bad i feel really bad finished there guys i thought i
