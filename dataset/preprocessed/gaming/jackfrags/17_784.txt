if I were to describe the three hours that I spent playing doom eternal last week it would be chefs kiss just like that this is the sequel to the 2016 doom which I absolutely love and I've got to play it for three hours fortunately this lived up to all of my expectations and it definitely enhances and evolves what we got to play in 2016 doom is one of those games that's just really fun to watch because it's so crazy you've got the awesome soundtrack to take downs and it's quite a challenging experience if you play on the more harder difficulty settings so I'm going to get all the new stuff out of the way fill your brain with knowledge and then just let you watch some of the gameplay unfortunately I can only show you 15 minutes but there's plenty of awesome moments in here for you to digest so what's changed with the new game then well as far as the story goes it's hell on earth 60% of the earth is now overtaken by demons it's not looking good but thankfully you're the doom Slayer you've got an awesome suit you got a ton of weapons and you've got a problem to solve son so get down there and start solving it in terms of the combat well this time around we still have the glory kills if you damage an enemy enough they will start flashing blue and then orange and you can execute them in all manner of disgusting fashions that you can think of if you successfully finish a glory kill you will get health back now what if you want ammo back well you've got your change so if you changed all enemies they will drop ammo once they die your chainsaw does run on fuel though some of these smaller enemies can be taken down with one pip of ammo but of the bigger ones can take up to three so you can't just run around chainsaw whirring everyone if you want to get armor the green stuff well now you've got to set the demons on fire and luckily for you you've got a over-the-shoulder flamethrower called the flame belch it's very short range but any enemies that you set on fire will drop ARMA shards and they'll drop even more if you kill them so for the basics those are the three main things that you need to know glory kills give you health back chainsaw gives you ammo and demons that are on fire will drop armor now on top of this you've got a frag grenade and an eye screen aid that recharge over time the eye screen aid just looks absolutely fantastic you can use this to micromanage enemies in a way because there's way more enemies now and so many different types you've really got to think about your movement and almost sectioning off certain enemies while you try and deal with the rest in terms of movement you've got a double dash that recharges over time you can also climb walls now and swing on things and you've got a new melee attack that builds up over time as you get glory kills you can just wipe out groups of enemies if they're close enough so you've got all these different elements in play at a basic level but then of course you've got weapons too they've got different mods that you can use and then you can upgrade the mods for example the shotgun that you start with you can turn that into an automatic shotgun or you can go for a grenade launcher there's a ton of customization here and on top of this you get perks and runes which can do stuff like being able to perform glory kills from further away or even slow motion if you need to give yourself a couple of extra seconds to line up the perfect shot and that's really handy because some of the bigger enemies now have weak points or danger points for example the arachnid Ron they've got a turret located on the back of their heads that can do a load of damage to you but you can actually take that out with a well-placed shot or a sticky bomb or grenade or something like that to disable it and that will make fighting that enemy much easier or if you come up against a kakko demon you can actually put a grenade in their mouth and of course that's not going to end well for them other things that I forgot to mention the super shotgun for example you can get a grappling hook mod for that that you can use to pull enemies towards you or you can use them as a way of flinging yourself around the level for example there's all sorts of challenges there's a ship which is kind of like your hope your home base and you can use that to travel to different worlds and upgrade parts of your suit a little snippet for you too from what I saw on the main menu I think there was a difficulty mode where if you die all of the progress is lost and you go back to the start again so for people who like a challenge that might be the one for you some of the level design is just absolutely gorgeous there's these giant mech suits which are frozen in place as they've been fighting demons from hell I hope I really hope at some point you get to go in one of those I mean it's just got to happen hasn't it what else there's a lot of Secrets of course hidden paths where you can find armor or plushy toys and usually that involves like a counter-strike style jump mat puzzle where you have to use your - and then you wall climb and you grab and then you get - recharges mid-air so you've got a chain all these things together there's a few puzzles in here - honestly it's just doing loads of things right and I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing the game I can't wait for this to be released I'm sure there's more stuff that I missed but the release date can't come soon enough because this was awesome that's all I'm going to say really enjoyed it with that said I've
