apex Season 5 launch today and introduced a new legend quest system a ton of interesting changes to the meta and balance of the game and much more and in this video I'm going to give you a quick overview of all of the most important changes and additions and a big thanks to EA for sponsoring this one so Lobo is the new kid on the block a legend with a vengeance and it turns out that revenant killed her parents when she was a child and she's absolutely looking to make him pay I know not everyone is into the law or the story of the game but I think the recent cinematic trailers have been fantastic and all well worth the watch before we get into detail about Lobo though Kings Canyon the map is back mostly with season 5 we're heading back to the original apex map although it's not quite how we remember respawn have been hard at work changing up the map and fitting it into the law of the low but release which means goodbye to your beloved skull town I can feel the tears from here that's not the only change either Thunderdome has also gone now but there is a new place of interest in the form of Salvage as well as that wetlands has been replaced by the excavation to sink labs and in general you'll notice quite a few aesthetic changes across the whole map it did feel fresh and new I know that some players were eager for the original untouched map to be added back into the game and maybe that will come at some point but I'm personally going to need a bit more time with this version to decide if I prefer it or not it's going to be the only map available for the next two weeks though and after that it will go into a rotation with the season 4 version of world's edge one of the new things that you will definitely notice on the updated map are charge towers you can't really miss them their massive glowing towers that when activated grant a full ultimate charge instantly to any legends standing on the platform when the blast goes off I expect these to be a pretty popular place to jump at the start of a game ok then Lobo the new legend she's 34 now but when she was 9 revenant murdered her parents and she became the master thief and eventually would break into a supposedly impenetrable facility and get her hands on jump drive technology stored inside and this is known in the game as her teleportation bracelet which also serves as her tactical ability with this bracelet Lobeck can teleport to hard-to-reach places quickly and easily you just throw it down and after a short delay you will spawn on the other side you'll have to be careful though as you won't have your gun out straightaway on the other end so if you place it too close to an enemy you could end up giving them a really easy kill so you can use this bracelet to get onto the top of buildings or up cliffs in general it's a incredibly useful tool that makes Lobo another very good movement character it doesn't have an incredibly long range though but you can activate it early if you want you don't have to let the bracelet land on the ground Lobos ultimate is all about loot for you and your squad it's called black market boutique and she uses her stuff to teleport all the nearby loot to the inventory of the stuff each friendly can use the staff to take up to two items but once you've picked those two up you can't go back to it anymore well there's a good chance you'll already be looted by the time you get your ultimate this could be useful for teammates who have just been respawn back in and when combined with the ultimate charge towers now on Kings Canyon you could find yourself and your squad pretty geared up early on and I did find it useful in situations where you've got a lot of death boxes around because you can just put it down and you and your squad mates can just go to one point and get easy access and viewing to all of the loot in the area and pick your two favorite things but that's not all though she's got a good passive ability to called I for quality which will allow her to see nearby epic and legendary loot through walls which makes her looting abilities second to none this means that Lobo is essentially a loop thief which fits in nicely with her story although I imagine that her teleporter will be her most useful ability only time will tell though if her balance will fit into the overall game and how useful a looting legend will actually be season 5 also brings with it something called the broken ghost and these are the quests it's a season-long search to find 9 pieces of a mysterious artifact and you can collect daily treasure packs in competitive matches up to a maximum of one per day these packs can contain you the crafting materials battle past XP apex packs or the ability to play a weekly hunt and then you go into the hunts which happen to be kings Kanyon at night to try and retrieve pieces of the artifact but you'd better hope that you can get out alive and have a good team succeed in each hunt to earn more rewards and unlock serial chapters that tell the story of the broken ghosts and if you recover all of the missing pieces you'll unlock even more rewards and supposedly uncover a secret that the Outlands may not be ready for as you would expect is also a new battle past season offering up plenty of new cosmetic items in the form of character skins weapon skins and weapon chomps now next up we're going to talk about meta changes because there's quite a few and most of them come to the legends and the guns firstly Mirage I can't say I've ever been a big fan of Mirage because I just didn't feel like he was a good team player but he's had some changes that definitely make him a bit more useful his tactical psych-out allows him to gain control of his decoys by pressing the character utility button when controlling the decoy it will mimic mirages every move if you release another decoy it will remove the previous one so that's quite different he's ultimate on the other hand will deploy a team of decoys that mimic his every move so that's even more confusing for the enemy and lastly his passives got a buff too and it will not only allow him to be cloaked went down but also cloaked when using a respawn beacon and reviving a teammate which also cloaks the downed teammate too I think that passive in particular is very strong some good changes to Mirage here but I'm still not sure that I'll be meaning that character anytime soon there's also a lot of smaller changes to Gibraltar Pathfinder octane caustic lifeline and Krypto mostly tweaks to ability times although some big ones caustics gas no longer slows down friendlies which i think is a massive deal you're gonna see a lot more people playing caustic now also pathfinders had a big nerf his grapple cooldown has now been increased from 15 seconds to 35 seconds and that means that you're going to be grappling a whole lot less pathfinder mains will definitely not be happy about that one now you may be wondering if there's any new weapons in season 5 unfortunately not it's the first season not to have a new weapon in fact and respawn say this is intentional because they feel like they've got too many weapons in the weapon pool and if they add more it will become too saturated interestingly they've rejected the idea of both weapons too because players could have bought skins for a certain weapon now even though there aren't only weapons there are definitely a lot of weapon changes the main one is the peacekeeper definitely a metal weapon for me has been moved out of the regular weapon pool and put into care packages and it has been buffed slightly as a result so that will be mad now the Mastiff on the other hand has gone the other way around so that's now in the normal loop pool interesting swap a few other small changes to the wingman longbow and alternator also come into effect but the gold arm has seen an interesting change too no longer does it give you 50% heal speed when instead shields cells and syringes give double the amount per use and wrapping things up I think one of the best updates for this game since it launched but suddenly one of the least talked about hyped features for season 5 is something that I've been begging for since day one and it's finally here a reconnect feature that's right at long last you can rejoin the game if you crash or your internet goes down whatever happens and at one point crashing on apex was so frustrating then I just had to stop playing it for a while it did get a bit better after a few and video punches but I think that you do still get the odd game crash so to be finally able to get back into a game is a huge relief providing that you don't manually exit the game via the menu or you alt f4 or you dashboard the game on console so if it's a legitimate crash or your internet goes down you will be able to get back in by restarting the game and the game will attempt to reconnect you if the match is still valid and you're still alive and the team is ongoing and as with most other BR games your character will remain in the place that you were when you disconnected and so if it happens to be in the middle of a fight you're still probably going to die but thankfully you could still be respawned if you rejoin the gaming your squad picked up your banner it's also worth noting that the death box inventory screen has been completely overhauled and I really like it I think it's a lot cleaner and easier to access certain items now overall I think this is a good start to the season I think I need a bit more time though with the map and lobha to fully understand how much I like them and understand how they play but I think there was some great quality of life updates in here and a map feels fresh enough that it isn't quite like playing the same original Kings Canyon all over the game there's a lot of new areas to discover and fight over here with that said that's all for today folks I hope you enjoyed this one let me know your thoughts on apex Season 5 down in the comments below have you tried it yep leave a like if you liked the video a dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see
