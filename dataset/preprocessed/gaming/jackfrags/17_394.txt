there really isn't any other game like hunt showdown at the moment the tension and heart palpitations that this game brings me is unparalleled now i haven't played it for a few weeks because there hasn't really been that many big content drops but recently they introduced different ammo types and a couple new mechanics to the game and next week they are adding a new boss this weird looking crow guy don't know what he does but it's a bit weird so i thought that i'd jump back in with some friends and get back up to speed before the new boss comes out i just kind of wish that they would do bigger content drops for this game more regularly i still want to see a new map more bosses more frequently new gameplay mechanics and of course new weapons and gadgets along the way the game is still doing really good though concurrent player numbers are increasing on steam always a good look but for a bit of context if you die in this game it's perma-death you can get knocked down and revive like about three times usually depending on what health bars you've got but unless you get revived you're out the game that hunter is dead and you've got to start a new hunter from scratch buy new gear get new perks xp level number etc so the stakes are very high and i think that's what makes it so appealing to me when i jump back in and in these two separate highlights i've got for you on both occasions we'd gone to the boss killed the boss and we were waiting for it to banish so we could get the bounty and extract but while that's going on the whole server knows that we're doing this and they can come surround the building and try and kill us and that's what happens here some really intense fire fights moments where it comes down to literally the last bullet and it could go either way i think you guys would enjoy this if you do leave a like and a comment down below thank you it's a great way to support me with that said there will be more hunt showdown coming up on the channel soon and we'll be checking out the new boss next week i hope you have fun with this one let's see what happened i've got bad guys on me i've got dogs they don't know i'm here they do know i'm here they know exactly where i am i don't that's not good is it this is a problem well now it's two squads he gets a freeman trying to help oh no i tagged him oh this is bad the flashbang yeah come on i'll split it up from the group behind us god i was trying to come and help freeman and the the boss group just headshot me he might be reviving his friend there got one not good careful though because there was a guy from the post office as well who just fired a shot that guy's been down twice jack i mean he nearly had me i think you've got a guide to your north east or maybe east yeah crows this guy's right here though oh my god that was close i'm going in screw it it's lovely work there's one oh my god what are you waiting for the melee okay so while i fight i'm gonna drop down here and i'm gonna revive you guys not like that not like that duck you've gone mad it's fine oh my god yes oh damn it oh my god is that gonna reach ow wish me push me did my molotov reach kind of you can get me differently it's reviver clock deck come on i'll then i'll get freeman okay i think they're preoccupied adam to be honest max just got super saiyan basically geez he just put bees down here beebs these bees beans are bees they're in the bus room these bees bees you put bees down you put bees down bees b there are some bees there i think they're inside the bus room someone just killed the bounty yeah sounded like they were outside though one of my right he's right next to me [Music] oh it was a bad guy was it i'll pick that up right here tagged i have ammo three more he's nearly dead he's nearly dead i usually killed me i've got some mama oh that's all three that's all three run away we're running okay ow the shot made me bleed oh god adam died didn't he i don't know when to pick up the bounty right now i'm not a big fan of this they're burning me now i can see them now it should be right here oh jack is a machine there's two more look down there you actually got one then as well yeah that was a headshot damn it don't show you how to defeat the pig boss in one hit all you do is you get the spade you run in here like this simple i forgot about that you tell him played in a while nice room to hold here i don't accidentally drop down legally it was illegal here he's in the uh the meme over there looking at us that's lovely guys he's wasted a few bullets his group the other group's like oh my god what's going on let's look over in that direction and debate the trap that i set into like on purpose yeah let's get off of that hitch well if you want to extract jack we can just go to allen fisher's sons they're in a fight you want to push him or do you want to run i want to get in a fight but i mean it's i can hear them here they're still in this building okay everyone come with me coming left side bridge there's many explosions in front of me someone had cited me i was just running over yeah where are you well i don't want to be on here oh let's go back what are we doing put those around that corner but okay trying to get behind them they're looking at you guys aren't they yeah i just hope so and shot again that's again i don't like it oh my god i'm gonna go back out onto the head peak i just got concertinated a barry concertina yeah you got me oh there's a guy right here i've got a hill he's low freeman dad do you mean you get him one like above jack he's literally throwing molotovs at me oh i see somebody's in that window was it me you're here man yeah i got tagged good distraction didn't get attacked that time i'm in the building again are they above me there was one of the republicans on the opposite corner i can hear them i've used my last dark side bottom level down here there's one below jack careful you've gone to the top hasn't it there were two below one upper yeah i'm down okay there's only two on site complete that was just the two yellow thing out he's got a tag on me there give me a sec probably be push they're down that was the guy that fired at me maybe anyone on dark side yeah we need to get we need to loot i see him he's in my building now okay okay we're here north side the building where's the gun out oh no one outside what outside of the logs here i've ran away tagged one upstairs in this building jack my building yeah she's up here somewhere i'm dead i'm outside damn it i'm at the top now stop the bleeding or it'll progress a tiny bit got me he's downstairs i think yeah 100 oh oh that was bad adam oh that was close oh there's more i'll jack the flicks don't it was a man me like a zombie i promise you i get no is there another way around to that area uh from the roof on the other side but i got shot from outside to the south east are they on your side adam yeah oh i'm out of bullets that's that makes sense i'm pushing you from where you shot that dead again that full jack you might be able to get me up i'll try and try you ready oh my god he didn't see you dude i didn't know he's that guy at all look he didn't notice me though wow i'm gonna loop two of these guys down here to get a dark side okay i discourage reviving me i've i'm a bag of paper at the minute running that body i'm gonna drop out and try and get this guy that's uh okay bye adam i'm going for a rest that was him right i distracted him yet i think he was over here i hear him what is he here is it the back of this building here we go [Music] i can't face again i'm dead you're slow southeast you're on loot man see if you can get a consumable or something i need this we need to kill that yeah i got it i got it boom um we could go north to puerto rico extract like and he'd have to come and revive his mates and then chase so i think like yeah we've been down to quite a few times probably best extract yeah okay i think he's the last guy live in the server isn't he yes yeah let's get out of there 20 seconds i'll make it free when you know that he might come and oh my god no no he won't it won't there's no way uh he has actually where is he fully joking yeah it does make the ball look good but when you've got like basically jack's mouse you know how like in um sci-fi films like that goes to the shell there's that guy his hand opens out into like loads of wires and he doesn't type in like that but jack's his palm actually integrates into the top of the mouse he doesn't move his hand at all he just he's like like he doesn't move he just he's like this yeah where he plays quite harrowing to watch actually it's strange isn't it you
