hunt showdown is no stranger to brilliant easter eggs and arguably the most famous one can be found on the lawson delta map the delorean from back to the future doc and marty must have got lost in time somewhere and ended up leaving it here although the third movie does take place in the late 19th century the same as this game so there's definitely some crossover here but the game has just released a brand new map called desal and in similar fashion to the previous maps it is chock full of brilliant easter eggs that have been discovered by the community and we're going to take a look at them all today starting off with shrek yes you didn't mishear me if you travel all the way down to the bottom left corner of the map in the southwest you'll find an opening in the rocks head through there and you'll find shrek's home what are you doing in my swamp as you can see it's almost exactly the same there's a nice table out front for a drink and a bucket for a mud shower it even has the toilet at the top of the stairs here what's hilarious though is that the second time i visited this place the game spawned in a meathead monster which does bear a striking resemblance to shrek himself no donkey here though which was quite disappointing moving on whilst there aren't any real aliens in hunt showdown the game now has its first ufo and this is in the very top left on the map right on the boundary of the playable area head out there and look up to the side of the mountain and you'll see the iconic flying saucer crash-landed in the side of the rock that's an unfortunate place to get stuck really all things considered i wonder if we're going to see more of these in the future though perhaps this could be the start of some sort of greater alien quest down the line next up south of the reeves quarry this is one of my favorites because it's so out of the ordinary of all the things that you could expect to see in such a serious gritty game like hunt showdown a giant pumpkin would be the last thing i'd expect yet here he is in all his glory the giant cowboy pumpkin king ready to slay some demons make some pies and scare off a few kids very surprising indeed i only wish that you could make it explode by throwing some dynamite at it i think that would be a great quality of life feature that the developers could add down the line this next one is super cool because it's hidden within one of the game's unique mechanics in hunt you play as bounty hunters who can access another veil of reality called dark site and when using dark site you can see things that normal humans can't see such as clues that monsters have left behind amongst other things head to lower desal and go into the saloon there's a ton of great detail in here and a piano that you can play but this room is hiding a secret on the wall here is a photo of a group of people the port sulfur band dated july 13 1894 and next to it is a note that reads you know where to find us interesting now if you use dark site a qr code will magically appear on the bottom of that note and then you can scan that with your phone camera and it will take you to a blog on the official hunt showdown website that goes into detail on how the audio team there created the iconic soundtrack for the game it is an absolute banger to be fair and well worth your time to read and of course listen to that soundtrack that band must have had some foresight though to create a working qr code in the year 1894 very impressive and now we head over to the desert to the south of darren shipyard remember this yep that is the utah monolith last year in 2020 in the real world this strange 10-foot tall metal structure was discovered in the lockhart basin of san juan county utah somehow though it's made its way into hunt showdown and whilst no one knows for sure except the people that put it there the leading theory based on satellite images is that an artist installed this sometime between august 2015 and october 2016. or we can just say it was aliens i'm cool with that probably not true though but makes the story better for sure and now from aliens to vampires in the crypt here at the first testimonial church it would appear that one of buffy the vampire slayer's descendants has carried out some slaying of their own you can find a body in a tomb complete with a wooden stake right through the heart and whilst there aren't any vampires so to speak in this game we might see some in the future i'd love to fight some kind of vampire boss that could only be defeated by crossbow we've got two more great movie references before we wrap up as well the first one being the godfather and you can find this easter egg over at the pearl plantation head upstairs and in one of the bedrooms you'll find a horse in a bed surely this is a nod to the iconic scene from the godfather where jack waltz wakes from his slumber to find a horse head in his bed showing him that the corleones aren't messing around bit of a job to clean that one up though and the second one here remember 127 hours the biographical drama movie from 2010 and in that canyoneer aaron ralston gets trapped by a boulder in blue john canyon but it looks like some poor soul suffered the same fate near the stanley coal company in this game but unfortunately for them they didn't manage to escape and finally hatfish or catfish with a hat this guy has been a recurring easter egg in both of the other hunt maps so i'm glad that he found his way onto the new one too the absolute mad lad what won't he do he's a catfish with a hat and he's off the chain and that's all guys i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like and subscribe for more i'm sure the hunt community will find plenty more easter eggs on this map down the line and i can't wait to find out what they are thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
