today i'll show you how to unlock the new secret bruin blueprint called firebrand in cod warzone and how to guarantee picking up a juggernaut suit advanced uav and specialist tokens which will give you all of the perks at once this one is an easter egg worth doing for sure and it's easier to do with a friend but you can do it solo like i did here so first things first you need to drop into this building in downtown it's the government building with the dome roof when you're inside take a moment to learn where these particular paintings are with the gold plaques underneath and remember which is which also assign them mentally or write it down with a letter or a name so this is what i called them if you want to copy my naming convention this one is beard lady green horse windows spooky mountain you can then use the first letter as they're all different and it's easy to write down quickly next go over to the keypad here and enter the code two one seven nine this will make a sound the room will lock down and start to fill up with gas now quickly turn around and interact with the computer behind you it will flash up a series of pictures and numbers each picture is a small part of one of the paintings that we just looked at followed by a plus number a minus number or nothing so make sure to write this sequence down once the sequence has finished playing it will ask you to input a code so leave this for now and instead go to the paintings that you were just given and make a note of the number at the bottom on the gold plaque keep in mind that the numbers only appear underneath when you've input the code so you can't cheat and do this beforehand so in my example here the order that was shown to me on the pc was lady green beard and horse my lady painting on this occasion was seven my green painting is six my beard painting is seven and my horse painting is eight so now we've got that information we can reference the code that we got on the computer and that was lady minus two green minus two beard plus two and horse minus two your code will be different to mine so we use that and then we get the numbers from the paintings and work out our code lady was seven so minus two is five green was six so minus two is four beard was seven so plus two is nine and horse was eight so minus two is six so my full code is five four nine six your code will be different and individual to you so now go back to the computer you watch the sequence again and then be asked to enter the code and you've got to do this in two halves top row first bottom row second but it's pretty easy to work it out just visualize the numbers in your head and you can put it together so my code again 5496 if you do it correctly you'll hear a jingle and the room will open back up the gas goes away if you run out of time however you will die from the gas so you've got to do this quickly and that's why i said that it's easier to have a friend tell you the painting numbers when you get the code so when you put the code in correctly head out of the building and go up to the new metro station to the south of the airport it's located right here and it's called airport metro get there head down the stairs and go straight through the doors in front of you interact with the big console here and a special train will be called to the platform go into the train wait a few seconds and it will take you to the secret maintenance metro station and when you get there you can go right or left go to the left to pick up the specialist bonus which will grant all of the pugs in the game to you at once pretty crazy and through that door in front of you on the table at the back you will find the secret brewing blueprints congratulations also scattered around here are a ton of orange boxes and high tier loot there's a load of cash advanced uavs a juggernaut suit miniguns field upgrades galore there is another specialist pickup in here too by the tracks so i told you it was worth it if you want to leave the station head back to the left room and use the computer terminal this will tell the train it's ready to depart and when you go inside it will take you back out into the war zone with your newfound collection of treasure i think if you go here get all the gear your squad will be pretty op in a normal round of war zone with that said that's all for today i hope you guys
