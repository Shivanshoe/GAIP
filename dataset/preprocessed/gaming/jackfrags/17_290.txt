let me show you something absolutely insane this is the c58 one of the newest guns one of my favorites and here it is with the iron sights 55 round mag shooting at the wall full auto no recall control and as you can see it's got a fair bit of recall right up slightly to the right and then slightly diagonal left and that seems fair because it's got quite a high damage profile so a lot of recall this is it with the 3x the axial scope and this is how i've been running my c58 so compared to the iron sights more or less exactly the same that's what you'd expect to see from all the other guns in the game but when you put the four times royal and cross on this gun this is what the recoil looks like it starts off pretty similar and then just nothing there's nothing i mean you know you compare it to the iron sight and the 3x look at that huge difference this isn't a new thing either i think it's been common knowledge for a couple weeks now in the community but maybe you haven't heard or seen exactly how crazy this is because look at the difference that's madness isn't it why can a scope do that to a gun why do scope attachments affect recoil at all i mean surely you should just have the base stats of the gun that's what you go off and the scope is your choice do you want to play longer range short range you want a quicker ads speed whatever it might be but it shouldn't really be having an effect on recall should it and here you can see i'm just pulling down on the mouse as i shoot and you can put the bullets in the same place fortunately they have actually just patched this right now as i was recording this video they released a small update for the game and they fixed that book so ideally the royal cross will be working exactly the same as the 3x now but i managed to record this game yesterday so this is using the old values of the scope and you can see it's just night and day compared to the 3x but it makes me wonder what other attachments out there are busted that people just haven't figured out yet but this match here was playing with tommy westy and tactical brits really testing how effective it could be and it worked great of course it did we ended up on the nakatomi tower at the top within the last couple circles which made for a really interesting few firefights at the end it's a good game to watch for sure and as always thank you to everyone
