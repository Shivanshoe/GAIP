hi everyone hope you're doing well welcome to some more call of duty warzone today we're going to play a few matches and take a look at a massive patch notes i suppose update note that has just dropped on the cod website we're going to go through this because there's like a load of new screenshots and information in here it's going to be pretty chill take a look through it all and then we'll play a few solo matches it's the night before a new warzone season it's it's the christmas eve of cod war zone can we can we go with that does that work warzone eve how about that i hope you're all doing well thank you for coming along today so we got some brand new art up here that's lurch that's someone else from shadow company that i think they give them a name down the bottom i don't recognize her either but there's a ton of new stuff here and they've just posted this so i thought that at the start we would go through this i think season five releases in about eight hours from now something like that so the hype is real it's a massive update honestly this is i think everything they've talked about here on the surface it seems like a really big update a sizeable update season four yeah it had a few new things in there but it was a bit light on the ground i think obviously current situation with the world didn't help that but i feel like with season five they've definitely improved a few things so the first thing that they released was this image right so as we know there's a few new maps coming to the game we talked about this yesterday with the stadium opening up and the train the train station interior we've got ascenders on the exteriors of buildings air 94 iso is the new smg lurch but there's a couple new things in here juggernaut drops down here now does that mean in normal br games we're going to get juggernaut drops because i don't know how i feel about that it could create a really interesting situation but at the same time i think people enjoy having juggernaut royale as a separate thing but we'll see i don't want to jump to conclusions i don't want to form any opinions before i've actually tried that but there's also this mini royale and we'll go into that in just a second but there's a ton of new stuff here and also this thing here i don't know what this gun is it looks like an lmg zoom in a bit what is that is that an lng or is that a shotgun of some kind i don't know i don't recognize that gunner like at all i don't does anyone know what that is and we've got dual kadachi's i suppose they're just a new melee weapon but there's a ton of info on here we've got some new screenshots as well that one to use for the thumbnail so that gives us a better look at the interior of stadium that's lurch i don't know what that gun is is that the odin got a weird barrel on it that but the big one of the biggest things about the new season is the stadium opens up they explode it you can get in here there's all sorts of bars and kitchen areas you take vehicles in there fight over it and this is another new screenshot of train station so there were a few little snippets of this in the trailer yesterday and i was like i'm sure i don't recognize that area but they say here that it's opening up like the side rooms and they all connect it says here the stadium isn't the only large-scale location getting interior access the ornate and imposing the dunks train station is also opening for operators the station buildings feature a number of inside locations to explore all linked to the main ticket hall and platforms this significantly changes the overall look feel and tactical outlook in and around this area of the warzone map so that's going to be quite interesting dropping on train station and then they talk about the train that's another new screenshot there look at this design is that based off a real train i feel like i've seen that from world war ii or something i don't know i recognize that from somewhere but it says here freight train a hulking freight train is on a path of destruction and it's up to you and your fellow operators to use this locomotive behemoth to your tactical advantage the train rolls through one of the main arterial railroad railroad there railroad tracks that circumnavigates the southwestern part of the dansk in a large loop so it goes all the way around over and over again it can be a source of protection and epicenter of firefights and even offers some exceptional takedown potential if your team claims the train for themselves and guards it with additional vehicles and heavy weaponry and this is a new screenshot again of the ascenders i do do you guys know where that building is because i don't recognize this building is that in downtown somewhere or is that undecided stadium i don't think so i don't know whether this is a completely new building also what's this guy shooting at just a load of bullet holes here i don't know what's going on there but it says here need to take down a troublesome sniper during past navigations through multi-floor building interiors usually located in downtown tavorsk district you may have clamped onto a vertical zip line inside an elevator shaft to gain quicker access to the top of the structure in parentheses and probably died to an entire squad camping there or six claim was on the ground in front of you now you can expect additional and strategically positioned exterior ascenders dotted throughout the dansk these will primarily be attached to the exterior of taller buildings enabling you to gain a tactical and height advantage from a different angle and with more haste than ever before so lots of you guys in the chat are saying that's one of the downtown tv offices i don't recognize it but i believe you guys so there you go that's in downtown so based on this it looks like they're just going to be on the tallest structures i'm okay with that because it means that if there's someone camping a building that's like a medium story building or a smaller building you could always zip up one of the taller buildings and use that to jump onto them if you get what i mean so i'm okay with them not being on every single building and also i think that's a great update there was some prison as well in the trailer this is going to be really fun looking forward to this so much because it means if you've got someone camping in that downtown area at the top well you can't just put two claymores down anymore on each set of stairs because someone could just come up here definitely will change the dynamic of the game and that's another shot of train station and get this a new version of battle royale mini royale this is this is really interesting this condenses the craziest parts of the main battle rail mode into faster paced chunks of chaotic and almost constant combat mini royale lowers the number of operators sent in for dansk but quickens the br experience only the first and last five minutes of a normal br game exist meaning rapid deployment constant movement and high kill strategies are set to yield victories that are both short and sweet ten minute battle rail match what's that about how's that gonna go down and they didn't say how many players it just says that it lowers the number of operators so what do you guys think 75 100 lower than that would it be like 64 maybe and 10 minutes i'd say your typical game is about 25 to 30 minutes but this could be really fun if you want to quickly level up your guns or just dropping with a couple of mates play a few rounds of that might be a completely different dynamic and there's the train that's moving through the that's over by promenade isn't it this area here that's cool definitely going to try that out a lot weapon rotation so they're changing the the loot on the ground the weaponry you discover lying on the ground or in supply crates has been meticulously updated to potentially provide new pre-loadout drop weapon tactics for your squad a lot of people in in the chat are saying 50 players for that mini royal i don't know if they've confirmed that but maybe a devas said it somewhere but here they're changing the ground loot expect eight common 13 uncommon 15 rare 19 epic and 25 legendary variants to find throughout the dansk it's cool i always enjoy it when they change up the the ground loot can we just can we just look at this for a second what is this mara skin she's got cat ears i mean is that is that okay are we okay with that i'd buy it and that's iskra i mean come on probably gonna be the most popular skin ever isn't it war tracks jam out to some sweet modern warfare tunes while you're cruising through the dance with war tracks available in the battle pass get three unique songs including the pulse pounding support crate to amp up your warzone experience equip one track to a specific vehicle in the vehicle customization menu then as soon as you hop in the music gets turned up your entire squad can listen to the beat while you drive and let the song guide you to your primary objective survival lots of people in the chat say no they're not okay with the mara cat ears [Laughter] watch that be the most popular skin i'm telling you it will i just hope to god that she doesn't meow or something because that i mean that's that's gonna kill the game so they've added songs to when you're in vehicles like radio so it's it's grand theft auto now you can play tracks right all three tracks are instantly unlocked when you purchase the battle pass i got a free weekend and then some multiplayer maps to be honest with you i only play multiplayer when i need to level up my guns for war zone and it's usually shoot house 24 7 or shipment 24 7. you guys the same that's i'm being honest i'm being honest i might try out the new maps though oil rig looks cool because it reminds me of that modern warfare 2 location harbor long-time veterans will recognize this map from the franchise's first ever multiplayer experiences so is that from cod 4 or like original call of duty like world war ii i don't know yeah they've got the airport as ground war if you fancy that i do like gunfight though i play gunfight a little bit gunfight's fun more multiplayer modes there's lurch weapon inspection finally you can inspect your weapons do you guys remember in the alpha you could actually inspect your weapon and then it just wasn't there in the beta and it wasn't there in the final game they're adding it back in this patch so if you want to admire your customized m4 your meta growl with a little charm on it with the waifu body pillow that's mine you can do that now it's really good for me because weapon inspections make great thumbnails because my thumbnails are pretty much like gun reloading or looking at a gun and then something in the background that's relevant to the video so that's cool there's new calling cards charms all the usual stuff that's one of the new guns the iso smg that's the new go skin as well gili ghost a precision crafted nine millimeter submachine gun with a rapid race of fire lightweight reliable and compact this is designed to control the battlefield at close ranges i i think that's going to be really good for modern warfare but for war zone i don't i don't know because surely the vector is going to fire faster than that so the vector will beat that up close so i'm guessing i don't know unless it fires really slowly and it's just got excellent hipfire or something and then we've got the air 94 here this could be really good or absolutely terrible i don't know because it's a burst fire look cutting edge 5.45 by 39 millimeter russian assault rifle with a unique hyper burst feature so as far as i know that's how the gun works in real life it's two quick shots and the second shot goes almost in exactly the same place that the first shot goes and there's tactical reasons for that the initial shot of a full auto volley is followed up by an instantaneous second round before significant recall is felt so it's like babang ba bang ba bang but every time your recoil is shooting up quite significantly this creates a tightly grouped cluster of shots with increased damage potential the mechanism is fed by a canted magazine and a reciprocating receiver helping control the recoil level up all of these new weapons to find the best custom configurations for engagements in multiplayer or warzone in gunsmith there's a nice looking air 94 skin right there so i do wonder when you level it up will it get a full auto attachment maybe because there are video games where the air 94 is full auto i don't know if it can do full auto in real life but i've played several games where they've had the a 94 and you can change it battlefield 4 for example that had a full auto a 94 and you could switch i don't know what this operator is though that looks new that's like a alternative rose skin i think blah blah blah that's the new operator lurch he's the big lad he's based off a real person the war tracks oh that's a new takedown that's the raven do you guys think this is okay or is this too far for war zone having a raven attack someone as a takedown i don't think you'll see it that often because takedowns aren't that regular there's literally an attack raven that kills someone is that okay is that too far i'm probably going to get it i don't know how the average player will react to that i reckon most people think that's fine but there was a gold like a a guy with a gold mask on in the trailer yesterday and i was like that's i don't know about that that one's called nevermore that's a reference to something isn't it there's some millskin sims there too it has full auto lots of people in the chat is saying that it does have full auto i think there's a mix in the chat there some people saying it's fine some people think it's too much people will buy it guaranteed that's one of the new operators velikon so he's from shadow company a shadow of a shadow tales of his exploits are written off as fairy tales at best gross exaggerations at worst those who know him never speak ill of him whether it's due to fear or respect no one knows that's quite a cool skin it's a bit of a samurai vibe isn't it i don't know if you get this skin for the ebr if you buy him it's edgar allen poe oh it's the poem isn't it about the raven yeah i know what you're talking about so he's one of the new ones got another one called mort morty a skilled tracker don't really know what they look like blah blah blah free stuff blah blah blah blah there's another look at the new operators again new skins at least and here's the kicker guys here's the kicker playstation 4 33.9 gig xbox one 49.8 gig pc pc one takes the crown 54.2 gig and 47.4 gig if you've got warzone only boys ah your internet connection is gonna be ruined tonight but it it does say that once you've downloaded it and it's been integrated into your game modern warfare will have a decrease in overall file size on console it doesn't say on pc all right that's a that's a big patch right there that is a really big patch you can pre-load it on console i think i saw people saying that their preload for playstation went live last night don't know if it's on on xbox yet it's definitely not on pc like icon i don't have an option to preload yet i didn't half an hour ago so what i'm gonna do tonight when i go to bed is i'm gonna leave my pc on and just hope and pray that it that it downloads the update [Laughter] oh i don't know man it's a massive like it will be insane this season it's a massive massive update i did see some developers tweeting as well saying that there's a lot of secrets there's lots of other new things that weren't shown in the trailer and i think what that means is easter eggs and different locations at the map that have changed a bit is he carrying a new weapon there what is that is that that lmg is that gonna be a belt-fed lmg is that the one in the picture i don't know but there's two more things that i wanted to discuss before we play a couple games there was an interview with infinity ward's design director on games radar jeff smith some interesting things in here warzone was built to be a stand-alone game and it will evolve and become tied to other call of duty games as they release in the future although warzone is very closely tied to modern warfare it was designed from the beginning as its own game as the game continues to be updated over time it will evolve and become tied to other games in the call of duty universe this is the first time an infinity war activision rep has said that warzone will be tied to other games in the cod universe in the past the company has just said it would evolve and connect games in the universe rumors about the 2020 cod game which is said to be called call of duty black ops cold war which by the way if you didn't see was leaked by a packet of doritos and how it ties to warzone have surfaced over the past few months one rumor suggested there will be a new war warzone map based around the 2020 game added during the 2020 games launch it's extremely important to us that the game continues to evolve from the beginning we've strived to continuously bring new and different ways for fans to play and continue having fun in both modern warfare and ozone so what i take from that is that when the new card game is out which was officially confirmed in the activision earnings call today they did their q2 earnings it's the first time they've officially said that there is a new card game coming out this year and it's developed by treyarch and raven they didn't talk about what it was called or anything but i think by now it's safe to say that it is call of duty black ops cold war i think we need some more subtitles but i reckon what's going to happen is warzone will change into black ops somehow whatever the new game is it will change into that region that area that time period the weapons will change the vehicles will change the whole map will be different that's really exciting to me yeah it's going to be a fun year isn't it tons of stuff for us to do hopefully they actually announce the new game soon or reveal a trailer or something i don't know but right now we are going to jump in and play a couple games of solo i'm looking at the chat so if you guys have any questions or suggestions please far away we've had a couple of new members already sean lee thank you adriano diaz uh clayton thank you for the 15. time to get rid of another game to make room rip battlefield 5. is bf5 gonna have to be uninstalled so you can download the patch oliver thank you for the two nash thank you name that makes you laugh said i'm buying the mara skin the cat skin i assume that means purely to take the mick out of people who think modern warfare is a milsim she's going to say you woun yeah okay uh chris thank you for becoming a new member it's grizzy and wolfy boy right now one thing that i am kind of disappointed about in that update they didn't say anything about anti-cheat obviously they did a tweet about a week and a half ago saying basically just saying please don't cheat i don't know i'd like to have seen an action plan or something but you know i'm hoping that there's a big anti-cheat update for this season and we see less cheaters in the game because there were times during season four where i was playing day after day and every single match almost was there was an obvious blatant cheater in there and that's not fun especially when you're in like a top five situation or something you've played the entire game and then some guy just aimbots you from across the map that's not good you know they need to get a lid on the cheating situation here i think they can and i hope they do but we'll see i think i'm gonna use ram seven today is the bruin gonna be nerfed tomorrow in the patch i don't know what about the foul is the foul gonna be nerfed is this the last time that you can use the overpowered bruin maybe will we be able to reconnect to the game ben that's a really interesting question i mean there are other battle royale games aren't there that let you let you reconnect i'm not sure i honestly don't know yeah this is our first game elliot first game here uh happy birthday nick thank you for coming along aidan you got the update already really use the grout before it gets nerfed kartik am i using nvidia freestyle no i'm not preparation i think it's too much of an advantage in this game to use it so i don't like to use it uh maxim thank you for becoming a new member papa john thanks for the 20 and sean thank you so much all right let's have a look are we playing so when are we playing for kills uh shroud thank you for becoming a new member battle royale you've got gas closing in fast get to the safe zone yeah you can reconnect on other games like pubg and apex i think the best way to do it is just have it so if you crash or if you lag out your character just stands there and you can be killed if you get killed by the time you come back then that's it you know [Music] unlucky [Music] i don't know why i'm going for a bounty but let's do it anyway there's a few people here eliminate all that gets into ao oh they got they are really quick they're no guns in here he's serious oh they're no guns well that's a terrible drop right there i think they're still fighting out there you can get crates in these planes as well [Music] bison whatever give me more plates give me more plates stopping power i don't mind if i do rest in peace he's got blue mp7 what is that weird scar no place though solos is too campy it can be yeah it depends how you play it i mean i like to i like to run around a lot you know it's probably not the best strategy for winning but if i camp too much i just get really bored oh man i wish hannah lost that little bit of health there it's a bit of a waste of a plate isn't it as long as you have a heartbeat sensor and you get your loadout pretty quick it can be quite fun solos you gotta listen out as well footsteps are really really important in solos and they're not great in this game anyway so always gotta be on your toes nearly i mean i can't turn down the foul can i it's too good obviously they had the foul in a lot of ground loop too in this season probably move it for the next season what do you think do you reckon i'll bring an m4 back i don't know underneath yeah take that problem with this area is that everything creaks a bit of cash there's more cash thank you what's up chapo how you doing thank you for coming there was someone else i think i should have saved that stopping power i'm about to get load out i put the uh the voice comes on as you can tell charger bro thank you so much man that's very kind to you i appreciate that what was it gonna do uh yeah round seven so i keep the foul i can't quite afford a ua there i want some cash in here oh an orange box look at that look at the uav now coming actual because we can fly over oh man a lot of people around they're all camping in buildings of course they are there's two people in that building there uav is out of fuel returning what what did he just jump out and go back in uh thank you for the turn sean i appreciate that [Music] i already had one this is a bit risky but i'm doing it anyway this is different guys enemy uav overhead he's got ghosts and he's got his loadout gonna get shot from there if i'm not careful yeah there we go still a guy here [Applause] come on i know you're there peek me oh come on someone else give me a breather enemy uav overhead i think he's gone up you save zone located yeah he went up the stairs don't come out that door please any place again oh i'm off i'm sick of this johan thank you for the 119. it's kinda yeah well i'm going to get you as well so gets that bye the double threat i'm dead oh this is really bad i think he's behind me because the threat hasn't changed oh triple threat got ghost this guy knows where i am i'm screwed ah i needed armor place fight then you return dammit the front line call 98 okay beat them down or capture the objective ah nice shot it is live albania that's a good shot cue again is the ram 7 still relevant yeah definitely 100 round 7 is really good i think the one of the only thing that beats it up close is the foul and the file is kind of op right so yeah the rhyme 7 is strong people are sleeping on it it's good ruined yeah salim i think if i had armor there i'd have had a better chance but got the jump on me unfortunately just destroyed me what's up zeus6 how you doing you're starting your own gaming channel any advice oh man it's difficult it's really difficult you've got to be consistent you've got to put out quality content your titles and thumbnails are really important try and find a niche have good audio quality good video quality work hard at it man took me nine years to get where i am now what's up mr wiggles love your channel thank you man i don't think it was a sus kill to be honest i think he just got the drop on me and i didn't i only had one armor plate so it felt like aim assist in gulag as well check your gear and weapons we go soon demol dominic thank you for becoming a member maxim thanks for the five you love the channel since battlefield 3. oh man 2011 let's go thanks again charger bro uh roly-poly what's up man thank you for the 20. uh jayred thanks for the five yeah you can pre-load it on

chd how are you doing uh wyatt thank you for the two good luck with the match love the videos thanks man what's obsessions hello sam louie's been a fan since 2013 so that's what like battlefield 4 time battle royale you've got gas closing in fast get to the same zone play the rest of ghost of tashima i don't think i will just because of how long it is it's a quite a long game and it doesn't really work very well for youtube what's up brady you're on vacation i hope you enjoy your vacation man [Music] one of my graphics settings everything on low a moted thanks for the 15. why don't i use

craig seriously on the roof he's chasing me i can hear him i hate this gun oh come on why is this in the game as well i need to get rid of that hopefully season five gets rid of that we don't need that no one uses it it's just taking up a piece of loot on the ground that could be an m4 well that dude didn't chase me i think stayed away doing a recon over there hit a 360 no scope i don't know about that man it's difficult iron sight foul from this distance it's not it's not the one i'm out oh kirby thanks for the 25 it's very kind here just wasted a couple of plates there no buy here

swear to god if this bounty comes down here i'm gonna go crazy i think they've gone up to the ramparts am i playing with rtx on no um just a bit of a heads up as well warzone doesn't have rtx features modern warfare does you can upgrade the shadows and i think the lighting changes a little bit but as far as i know it isn't actually in it's not actually in warzone i definitely just heard someone and i just gave my position away i'm gonna get out of here now i can just chill on here can you uh richard thank you for the 50. you've been watching since bf4 first time i've caught a live stream really enjoy the content thanks for some good times richard that's not a problem man it's very kind of you thanks thanks for supporting me i mean i could speaking of sandwiches what's my favorite sandwich egg and bacon if not then oh man ham and cheese toasty a chick chicken and stuffing like there's so many good ones isn't there i'm gonna throw this out and have a look there's only 11 people left

true i don't have any kids that's a new raven no i don't have any kids someone just got sniped they chill here at some point someone might run through the middle where's that loadout gone there's a sniper in the prison package it's going out the back of the prison though i feel like it might it might be better going out and around what do you reckon let's do it were they killed from above maybe i can see plates i don't know if that's from above right there oh this guy's got me pinned ah that's well played i was in a really bad spot there that was a bad game overall terrible start hit the gulag have to not get well i did have my loadout but dude just creeps up on me stadium a criminal you should make a video of guns that you like but everyone hates is there many um i think most people know what the good guns are what the metaguns are right i quite like the origin 12 the shotgun i like the mp7 mp7 is great in solos if you're playing aggressive um i can't no there's not really any

i've read like different reports about it though some people said it was a fireworks factory that exploded or something i don't know they're saying that it was an accident and the last thing i read was that 10 people had passed away she's really sad i saw the video with the explosion it's like uh it looks like a nuclear warhead going off to be honest it's like a giant mushroom cloud someone keeps asking to see my setting so i'm just gonna show you uh there you go so playing 1080p i stream at 1440p everything's on low disabled anti-aliasing and then 240 hertz for the refresh rate that's i mean the famas is probably one of the worst guns in the game i've used it i did a video on it didn't get a win though it's awful it's just first rifles don't work very well uh divitio thank you for

it there andrew thank you for the 70 from south africa what's up madam do you like indian food yeah i love it why do you use filmic i mean what else should i use i think i use filmic because if you don't it causes like visual noise i can try that one instead is that any better i don't know i don't know if that's more or less performance but i mean my frame rate is really good anyway i don't really uh i don't think i need to like get any more frames to be honest uh where is it frames per second likes that is that any different i don't know [Music] there's no patch notes yet boy but they made like a brand new post where they detailed all the stuff [Music] you secretly enjoy the fam ass no i don't enjoy the famous it's not for me [Music] battle royale right okay i need to focus up move to the safe zone let's try and win a match i got the most budget win earlier in the day it was it was great it didn't feel good though does filming make it blurry i'm not sure have i ever been to australia no i'd like to go there one day though definitely he was late it's a long way though from the uk did i just drop i did i would i'd like to go there someday that's perfect although i don't like the fact that my contract is taking me to superstore uh sam thank you for the hundreds [Music] it's on the roof okay let's get up this side 28 meters i don't know if they're inside or on the roof i think they're on the roof right there someone over here unless that's a decoy yeah it's a decoy have a girl any news on gili seek ghost i should be out tomorrow i think should be able to get it it's floating why is mario floating what happened to him i don't know and the game definitely looks different with this anti-aliasing i don't know if i prefer it though there's a jeep going over into the there it fells nicer with the scope on it isn't it i kind of like it with the scope on if it doesn't have the scope on i can't stand it was this guy doing why did you just go prone to be fair it put me off i was confused so why would you do that he's just got his load out as well he's out there isn't he there's two people one's above me maybe they're both above me yeah the file needs to be nerfed and silly i need this guys i don't know where he is don't like it though it's gone could have gotten that jeep maybe there's someone in superstore here this laser is horrible it gives you away so bad and whoever's here's got ghosts i'm getting out of here i'm scared it's a horror game it's not a br game it's a horror game a cracker thank you for becoming a new member why is that jeep doing out there i don't know where this dude is don't like it there's gonna be an airdrop soon i think there's someone on the roof it's called listen out for footsteps i want to get to that buy station i can't open this is a terrible idea but whatever [Music] [Applause] look at that dude up there i get him he's sniping at someone so he might be distracted let's have a go uav is out of fuel returning to resupply still there enemy uav overhead it's a good distraction and nobody thank you for becoming a member he's on the other side still on the other side gotta be really quiet here still there what do we have hdr what is that it's like a weird looking m4 you going for the loadout no i want it though let's do it [Music] oh it's in a horrible location get my ram nope give me oh my god they need to fix that loot man it's so annoying can get you killed all right i'm feeling good about this now i've got my ram seven i've got [Music] ghosts i don't know where that guy went he's not here though he's running past running the tower i don't know where this guy went i thought he would have gone up there like in that building right that makes sense 50 meters could be up there now he's more in that direction though hard to get up there he's not moving at all he's fine shots he might be distracted could be an easy kill i'm careful yeah right buff troy thanks for the five he's gone no he's not right above me he's just i don't think this guy knows i'm here no he's jumped yeah there's a chance should just be down here somewhere my shot couldn't see him could drop the airstrike on him gonna go left should i hit that shot as well rushed it no he's still there there's a good shot from him to be fair there was a guy next to the dealership i didn't see anyone at the dealership what's that helicopter the hell there's usually people up on twins there let's have a look kind of looks really grainy with this anteriorly thing i'm not sure i like it where should we head those buildings can be okay i feel like that jeep you see that attack rover on the minimap someone's ditched that there i'm not really thinking about power positions here either i'm just playing the zone which is not the way to win you've got to really think about what your next move is and where the circle's going so don't don't play like this if you look at the tips don't play like this yeah don't copy me hobby center is really useful in solos just chill here for a second see if anyone runs in people like to play the edge of the gas in vr games oh man it's a long way to go what's the barrel on the ram it's the longest one uh pony may the one that gives you the longest range it's that one i don't know what it's called sorry just kind of feeling there was someone in there it's more cover at train station although you can get camp from the roof next play thank you no i should play it there okay we gotta go [Applause] so should i put the trophy on it forgot [Music] kind of don't want to get off now switch [Music] it's a bit of protection is the ram 7 good to play with yeah it's really good [Music] oh this is gonna be the train i think this is the route that it'll take [Music] that could be good up there oh why does it do that so enemy annoying overhead up finish the fight gas is closing get to the new safe zone that dude's still there now he's gone oh you're kidding me why are you there so annoying i got my heartbeat sensor out right at the top of the stairs otherwise i'd killed him god that sucks that's solos for you though man that's solos [Applause] oh dear so frustrating that's just how it be sometimes what's up anthrax how you doing hey mr blob hey jp thank you for becoming a ghost i appreciate that munchen thanks for the ten let's see if this guy can get another kill and the goo lag literally just closed as well so i mean he hasn't moved at all this is what this guy does get you right chilled out oh no he's gonna drop no he's staying that jump scared you did it pure skill outplayed is that right christy yeah i did jump as well which may have uh hampered me but just a bit of panic you want to see the rhyme class yeah monolithic fss ranger geo mini reflex the iron sights are trash commando four grip 50 round mag 50 is the most you can have on the ram it's really good in solos in trios and squads yeah maybe not so much maybe not so much i felt good about that one i thought i was on to win that oh uh goodnight fairytale prince noblesse warrior of peace and justice in the galaxy see you later buddy some people were saying that they've announced cod 2020 but we went over it at the start of the stream as far as i know that's all they've announced unless they've actually have they released a trailer or check your gear i'm just looking on twitter i don't see anything treyarch have just said that they're officially developing it that's it oh my i just had massive deja vu i kind of don't like deja vu because it's weird isn't it like not many things are actually weird in real life or considered supernatural if you're logical and reasonable an explanation for something deja vu is just weird and you can feel it from what i've like researched about it it's it's a misfire in your brain like a signal being sent around your brain twice in a loop when it shouldn't be it's completely harmless but it makes you think like you've lived that moment before even though you haven't weird man [Music] uh giannis thank you for the two season five's out in about six hours adam is approaching your position move to the safe zone i will thank you for the five i am a play yeah it's been a busy busy day today we did three hours of uncharted earlier and then i had a bit of a break and now we're on wall zone you're clear to engage getting everyone prepped for

too clever i tried to get the takedown [Laughter] i should have just kept it simple trying to make it look flashy for the stream it's my downfall man it's my downfall what am i looking forward to the most about season five lawrence definitely the map changes definitely the map changes i feel like warzone's at the point now where it's right at that moment where they need to change things but it looks like there's a ton of stuff coming a geek developer are you planning to play horizon zero dawn on pc maybe i might give it a go i played it for an hour on ps4 when it came out deployment what's my top three cereals that's a great question it depends what mood i'm in if i if i fancy something savory and sweet at the same time it's gotta be lucky charms if i want something that's a snack honey cheerios golden nuggets if i want something that's not going to kill me kellogg's fruit and fiber there you go top three cereals munching do i get nervous playing in front of thousands of people no not really you get used to it it's a bit different than doing it in real life isn't it i mean i'm not it's not like i'm on a like a grandstand somewhere or on a stage it's just whatever the more you do it you get used mcu per dude lucky charms are op they are open you know it yo you've got options you can pick the marshmallows off you can eat them together you can eat them separately with the milk you've got so many options there [Music] so many options that's like three options coco pop's a good cross but i've got to be in the right mood for chocolate cereal like chocolate cereal is it's an acquired taste for me targets are up get to work there's another guy here i think he's on the he's roof crates another one outside one on the roof and someone there give me some plates please yes that's only gonna do a little bit of one though oh dude you're killing me nice i think there is still someone on the roof i'm just shooting over there should i go hunt him down i'll try a reason thank

maybe vincent here and your return to the front line okay it's fine it's time break do i have any pet savage kim no i don't i don't have any pets it's crossblade on yeah you can't play warzone on pc without cosplay it doesn't let you play if you don't turn crossplay on same for xbox as well you can turn cross play off on ps4 but it means that you get slightly longer matchmaking times toby thank you for becoming a member rambo i'm a big fan from beirut big explosion happened and it massively impacted all of beirut i'm glad you're okay buddy yeah i saw we were just talking about this earlier there was a massive explosion at a fireworks factory or something check your gear weapons where am i from from england uh mitchell thanks for the tent you turned 25 on the second and i want to know what your all-time favorite game is multiplayer probably counter strike because i've played it the most i've got so many good memories from it single player i would say for me it's between the last of us and zelda ocarina of time on the nintendo 64. i'm gonna go with that [Music] it was ammonium nitrate okay hey joe thanks for the three warm-up is over standby muncher thank you for becoming a member why can pc hold multiple kill streaks i don't think it can [Music] i've never been to dubai steve no james thank you for becoming a member gas is closing on your position suggest you get moving i need to actually play a game where i get a loadout that'd be great [Music] a damian thank you for becoming a member do i sleep it's almost 1am yeah i sleep i'll be up at 9 in the morning i found this supply cash ready for pickup uh windy thank you for becoming a member and jacob thanks for the five [Music] a suppressed eagle who uses that ever look at this thing i mean it looks cool but it's awful oh backyard bbq i see don't think anyone else drops here famous last words now we've been getting spanked tonight though solos is just like that sometimes though it is tricky but we'll get in the end what's that d quite now i think if you're playing this late as well eu the only other people that are playing are the sweats like me so it's tough it is tough how do i get that is it up around here how'd you get that one i don't know you could get on the roof but i don't really fancy that give me the plate nice i guess cheeky little jump there isn't it with four plates as well pretty good that one's underneath oh good just what the doctor ordered solid one have i got time to get my loadout before this dude turns up i'll get cited i think so i wish i had enough for a uav i was just driving around his car having a great time lovely i don't really have far to go either for the enemy contact the zone okay can't see that guy i kept the car 98 sonic do i think nvidia filter is good i mean it definitely helps you see things clearer on pc but i don't think it's fair overhead so i don't use it because it's i think it gives you too much of an advantage over other pc players but it gives you a massive advantage over console players there's another game that i play called hunt showdown and that's got a big problem with nvidia filters because there are some times where the map is night time and if you use nvidia filters you can make the game look like daytime so you can see that's a big problem what was that explosion about yeah i should have bought a uav i forgot please and one-on-one with the stopping power of ram seven i should beat most people there is a buy here i could use uh napkins thank you for becoming a member i appreciate that bro enemy uav overhead he's right there i drove the ripper you got ripped enemy contact thank you get to the new safe zone he's running enemy uav overhead you know i'm just going to leave that dude get uav here get sulfurase coming actual because we can fly over can't sleep uav still out of fuel returning to resupply [Applause] could have got my hdr there but i know i've used that loadout already haven't i losing ground stupid doors man joe thanks for becoming a member i found this if you need it should i go for that you've got to be keen when you're going up these stairs otherwise you get memed by someone camping which happened to me last game as you guys saw you can check this here so you want to check the roof i did show this last time i played i think but we just want to quickly check the roof that's a way of doing it no one up there i kind of wish i had my hdr here and a claymore maybe that'd be good identified you're clear to engage mark on the grid let's go let's go ah i wanted them to be on the roof overhead main fire station where did that come from i don't think that was the fire station guy maybe it was he's right there i just don't expect them to go up the tower it's such a cliche how was that not a head shot yeah that was a great sound wasn't it let's check there's no one around i feel like that guy doesn't have any idea where i am though you know really could have done with the claymore here no one on superstore i just hear a i footstep i just heard a footstep oh man train station again vendor here might have what you need that looks clear he's jumped in a truck out there give me a free load up please i want to get my hdl no looking at me climbing [Applause] horrible nope we're clear i think okay this might be a good building just chilling for a second see if we catch anyone running in from the north here i think we will [Music] what are you looking at [Applause] gonna be someone else what was he looking at there did i just hear a shuffle oh man there might be someone downstairs a ghost nope kidding me i could have sworn i heard a shuffle no one on heartbeat unless they made it to the roof that would suck just the ambient noise you think let's see where next song goes only 19 left it is a monkey isn't it joshua it's probably not that scary to watch this but to play it when someone could be anywhere the second that someone starts shooting at you it is really nerve-wracking it just it makes you like jump just like whoa train station ending not a big fan of this good guy up there are you kidding me how did he have an angle on me there just got the gulag it's kind of a horror game isn't it oddly yeah i think i would have been better there trying to flank and shoot me around because i had to stop environment here and you return let's try and get this one you lose your fight is over flashing a flag it's time to break is he trying to bounce flash i don't know man i need a loadout i'm just guaranteed to be someone on train station like no doubt one of these red buildings could be a good spot but the likelihood of there already being someone there is quite high i feel like i have to do it though to try and get some loot and odin okay not exactly what i wanted but whatever don't have ghosts anymore either that dude obviously got sniped it could be someone below me as well with ghosts where are you are you in the building move up i want to go for that loadout real bad sniper over there you know i'm just going to drop in if you say he's here no he's not here okay odin is a terrible gun for close range as well i'm great it's not a bad position really at the moment but i just don't like the guns yeah it's definitely down there that's better at least i know if someone comes in this building i can probably out damage them with this quad bike they're gonna have to jump on there how is he firing at gas is closing in relocating the safe zone someone in the gas there going silver okay that was horrible one play he's right there was he lower i don't know someone right below me chewing your legs mate sorry guy below me knows i'm here though down here somewhere train station might kill me now really bad position so if anyone's got a heartbeat sensor i'm kind of done you gotta go i gotta go let's just be friends is he gone i think he's gone oh this is really bad i don't know where any enemies are in front of me it's three left it's probably a good spot as any i know there's someone over there no spare plates no it's coming back towards me i'm giving my position away though it's bad yes come on get it whoa that was really really but clenchy oh that one felt good that one felt really good to win i hope you guys enjoyed watching that that's the win that we needed that is it [Music] gg's in the chat boys ggs that was a rough game wasn't it this is how sweaty solos are eu late at night it gets it gets really sweaty but it's good fun when you win a game like that even though it's difficult it feels good because you had to work for it you've had to work real hard for it oh oof close game really close game ah man oh the chat is going crazy right now absolutely crazy right guys that is about two hours and 15
