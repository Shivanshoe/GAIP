boys and girls we have got some exciting news for battlefield 2042 ea just did a live show called the future of fps games and on it they had some of the big wigs from respawn and dice stockholm dice la who have just rebranded to ripple effect studios but doesn't change what they're working on they're still doing this thing for daiso late and they dropped a pretty big bombshell about what that is in this live show so we're gonna get stuck into that there was a few other things in here too quite interesting seeing the inside of these devs what their favorite games were plans for upcoming games they also talked a bit about battlefield the future of it in cloud computing so my opening comments there so let's take a look so we know that dice stockholm are making the all-out warfare in the game they've also talked about a second game mode called hazard zone and to be honest with you in this whole thing we didn't get anything new about hazard zone at all but the third experience not mode they keep saying experience is what daisola have created and christian grass who is the general manager of daisolana ripple effect studios had this to say work that oscar and christian have been doing for battlefield hasn't even been revealed yet but christian i'm hoping that you can maybe give us a little bit of a hint uh so i can't say that much about it uh what i can say is this though is that one of the components in this experience that we're creating is that we're adding some of the fan favorite maps back into battlefield 2042 but the entire experience you have to wait a bit longer before we reveal what that is adding fan favorite maps back into battlefield 2042 and then there's that little bit about the whole experience so it looks like this isn't just a case of oh here's a remake of caspian border on the new frostbite engine in 2042. from what he said there it sounds like this is remakes of maps plus some other big component there too this is a pretty big deal i think it's battlefield fans we've all got our fan favorite maps right and dice have the data for years and years to see which ones are the most popular or not and what's cool about this i guess is that for the all-out warfare mode they've revealed seven maps already and on top of that we're going to get more remakes of maps too so at launch there could actually be quite a few maps in here but i have to ask you guys if you could pick like let's say three maps to be remade for the new game what would you go for i don't want to say what mine would be because i don't want to influence anyone in that respect but let me know what your top three would be down in the comments below there was a couple of other comments about this experience but it was mainly hype they said that this thing they've been working on has been on the whiteboard for 10 years or so so whatever it is it's big they said there's a massive level of excitement about it in the studio they've had big zoom calls and the reactions are always insane and recently they showed it to lars gustafsson who's mr battlefield himself and they said that he was just jumping up and down on his chair because of how good this thing was so they're really trying to drum up excitement for this thing moving on there was a lot of fluff in here but i think the only other real piece of new information that we got here was about cloud computing and how that might relate to battlefield 2042 but also how it will relate to future battlefield games so this is oscar gabrielson he's gm at dye stockholm this is what he had to say oscar i'm very curious as to what your answer is you know cloud computing has really changed a bunch of other industries and gaming is kind of barely touched on it so if you think about a game like battlefield we have things like ai in the game now destruction actually procedural level creation and the next-gen consoles there are of course super powerful but if we move much of that logic out to the cloud which is kind of servers and other language uh we can do some really high scale computing that we haven't been able to do in the past destruction visual fidelity uh and i think it's just a couple of years away and then you'll see some pretty cool shooter games out there i'd imagine but we'll see soon trademark battlefield 2042 being one of them uh no comments so i don't think the oscar was referring to battlefield 2042 there didn't rule it out at the end but didn't confirm it either so potentially they could have cloud computing stuff in 2042 but he did say that it has procedural level creation and i don't know what that means but we've never heard that before in relation to 2042 so that could be something big and they just dropped a little hint there but when he said you know maybe two years away there's some pretty cool shooter games perhaps dice are working on something else which is leaning heavily into that cloud-based computing for destruction visual effects ai and maybe the next battlefield game after this one could be even bigger in scale and fidelity than what we've seen with 2042 exciting times ahead for sure if you're a battlefield fan there was a little note about commander mode as well oscar was talking about how one feature he missed from previous games was how you could use the commander mode app do you remember that for bf4 where you could use a phone or a device like a tablet to play as a commander in a server and he said that he missed that but he wasn't implying that this would be in battlefield 2042 i think it was more of a hey if we could see this one day in a future game that'd be neat so that's all don't want to drag the video out because that's really all there was i hope you guys enjoyed this and found this interesting do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below july 22nd ea play that's when we'll know for sure exactly what this brand new experience is with these remade maps i'm looking forward to it for sure if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
