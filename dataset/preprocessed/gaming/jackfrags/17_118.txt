where are they oh there's a tank we've got a spawn making down there thank you i knew there'd be a guy on top and we've got some support now and that's the end of the tank i thought for sure i was gonna be dead then welcome guys to some vf5 today we're playing on allison dan otherwise known as al soon done what the community called it back in the day because it just kept getting like delayed and delayed again and again and again i'm using the comments yet here ow three four five six four four three two two what that was the weirdest name ever i think this is actually their gimme point here so maybe not ideal but hey it could be fun flying over this somewhere that we shouldn't be look at that stucco there nobody there there's so many enemies on the point then for a second what the hell no i must have been that plane oh my god you hear it that sounds so cool we go there yeah i didn't really play this map that much when it originally came out i think i played it the most in breakthrough i remember it on xbox because i did a couple videos back in the day where i was playing on xbox just to see what it was like and it was a very different experience let me tell you of course we're playing on pc here maximo bernardo charlie look at him go what a legend so we go over to c and d could be an interesting proposition over there i just felt like playing something shooty again you know last week or what i suppose it was the start of this week but like thursday friday saturday sunday and monday i think i was doing dying light to doing a whole live stream play through that so it's nice to actually come and shoot things again and i think that crossfire x game is out soon as well tomorrow i might give that a shot single player and multiplayer because the remedy the guys that make like max payne and alan wait control they've done the single player for that so i'm interested to see how that turns out oh hello i need to put my uh red hit markers on remember a couple weeks ago i did that single player level the one on the skis i love that but i changed all my hit markers so they're all white and uniform so they just looked a bit better i feel there's somebody here good scream objective i think that's a headshot yeah it is yeah i like having the headshots as red so i just know straight away that i've killed someone so next time i play i'll make sure i go in and adjust that that guy dead ah i thought they might walk into that come on let's push into the point lads try and get it we go left on the high ground feeling a bit vulnerable here though because i've only got my sniper i have any flares so no recon it's bound to be someone here i can shoot where are you there's someone on my left i'm gonna go mad they're dead my friend is in there now i think if i move further up the hill i might find some enemies i thought i could hear someone there is another one down here though are they being rest oh don't you dare kill me oh good shot agm 4-2 there was a point where that was so so good and then i think they nerfed a bit is that medic actually oh my god maximo panado what legend and they put the smokes down thank you so much man it's a very conscientious medic there put a grenade in there did that go in no no no on my right maximo you got to be careful though max smokes down love it we need to get into this little building here look oh god they're right here there's another one down here i think somewhere good job max this mouse guy is great i'll try and capture this i don't think so mate right get on the point get it captured can i jump in dice there we go spawn beacon down just in case hello oh wait no was that a falling headshot with a sniper rifle that's one of their machine gunners that guy is sick i got you i got you don't worry only croco grenade hit but no kill that's a tank that's a grenade they are coming in i'm dead i'm dead i had dynamite i didn't really have time to go for a res there that's a pretty decent start that guy's on 45-0 what is he cheating oh my god he's actually cheating i think there's no way someone would have 45 kills as infantry already 149 where is this guy i don't know they're sniping as well so that would be very impressive we got it good just do cheating charlie read your visa number allowed please what the hell how peculiar yeah i reckon that guy is cheesing [Music] i don't know 53 in one maybe i can look at the stats somehow oh come on vehicle let's go oh you got a stoke 61 and two they've got to be cheered let me ask is that dude cheating i can't type see what they say i just don't see how you can have that many kills as a sniper especially on this map oh not a headshot that was i don't know yes hard to tell though isn't it when they're on your team and some of the enemy players have left as well oh missed take it have a look here there is someone there maddie check it out well i think we got to win this obviously but it may have been helped by that cheeser i feel like maybe without score see if they say anything at the end that was a fun game coming back to bf5 not played it since christmas day last year so interesting to come back to three four six to zero again it doesn't feel fair report please i might stay and see what happens in the next game i've joined the next match on hamada and i just want to see if they start racking up kills again like that 140 ping as well give it a second they're not even loaded in yet okay they've actually joined the game now what are they in and they've locked it this is the guy here look let's see what happens i just want to see if they just hit everything they hit that objective that was another headshot hit that headshot [Music] it's like looking through the walls as well i'm gonna follow him and see if they just keep hitting headshots what are you doing here mate i'm sorry steve had to be like that [Applause] steve [Applause] steve you're not steve i've been wandering around for like the past five minutes trying to find them they've now got 38 and three 39 and three i think that's them up there they're just like aimbot sniping people from the top ly lt cheats thousand percent i think that's the guy there no he's just picking off people getting kills 41-3 forty two three yeah it's that guy i mean i'm gonna report the guy but look he's just dropping head shots disgusting how do they even get up there you just go from in here 46-3 they've gone now look they're going back up yeah they're going to go now put a spawn beacon down as well can i destroy that yeah enjoy that god it's so annoying when people cheat like this same next headshot what are you aiming at someone down there is there you see the aimbot working that's a headshot here right here guys [Applause] almost looks like the bullets aren't going where he's aiming that's another headshot yeah this guy's hundred percent cheering we'll get this guy banned easy i can't believe they're at level 149 though that's nuts how they got that 4g well that's a shame another that's ridiculous come on please don't do this guys this is bad i wonder if i could like somehow run them over is that possible i'm not sure you can team kill in this game come on there we go what if i i'll do that nope i just like ram into them with this will that work it doesn't work just stand in the way why does that work what the hell anyway guys thank you for watching shane there was a cheer but what can you do if you enjoyed the video guys leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in
