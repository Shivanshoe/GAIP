now before we get into today's more serious topic i just want to take a look at the bsvm in bf2042 this is the new gun that you can get in the game kind of looks like the vss ventures but it's quite clearly the best gun in the game right now by far it's very versatile so you can use it long range and short range but if you use the high power extended magazine it's only got 20 rounds and you sacrifice the reload speed the rate of fire a little bit of projectile velocity it's a three hit kill as you can see even over long distances to the torso and if you get a head shot and a body shot even at this extreme distance that's a kill pretty nuts and i think it's what i'll put in the gameplay in the background here as i'm talking today hopefully a bit of domination i haven't recorded it yet so whatever's happening on the screen now i hope it looks good as i mentioned bit of an important topic today i did briefly talk about this in a war zone video but there's a big portion of my audience that just watched the battlefield content so i think a lot of people actually missed this or didn't watch that video so i wanted to make a bf video where i talk about this because i've seen five people fall for this already and it could end up meaning that you get scammed or you lose a load of money someone gets your personal information your details whatever so we're gonna talk about it please pay attention it's important you may have noticed in my videos and other people's videos over the last few months or so there's been a lot of bots in the comments and i've obviously been targeted by this and it's been pretty bad really for the last six months or so and i do try and keep on top of it on youtube you can hide users comments so they can type and they think that their comments gone in the chat but it's actually only appeared for them so whenever i see them pop up i do remove them but of course it's a losing battle and this is a systemic problem that youtube has and really it's got to be solved from the top one of two forms this will happen usually they steal a picture from a profile usually if someone not wearing much clothing and they copy legitimate comments and then they're added to a video as if they're a real person and of course these are just cam sites or scams you click on the profile and they'll link to some dodgy website and it's obviously very eye-catching when this kind of thing happens so that's the first one to look out for in respect to those i would just not reply to the comments and maybe report the profile if you can be bothered and the second most prominent method that i've seen which i think is a bit more egregious than the first scammers will make profiles on youtube and they will actually take content creators logos i'm showing you some examples here so they'll download my logo they'll then pretend to be me in the comments on one of my youtube videos and they'll reply to legitimate comments saying hey reply to me send me a whatsapp on this number or telegram me you've won a prize you've won a pc you've won some money and believe it or not a lot of people fall for this a couple of times i've had people email me and just today on twitter i had an interaction with someone where they were saying they were going to add me on telegram but they were waiting for the app to authenticate of course i stepped in and replied please don't you being scammed and it's believable i think because i do try and reply to comments on my youtube videos it's a community after all and i read the comments i don't have time to read and reply to every single one of the comments but i do try my best if i see an interesting topic or discussion i'll try and jump in and reply say something just to get a bit of communication going so i do reply to comments so people will see this and then they'll go oh great he's replied to me i want a prize i'm gonna send him my number text him my details on whatsapp or sending my address so i can receive delivery of this pc that i've apparently won ultimately it's all a scam so don't reply to these people don't send them any information don't dm them i do have the option to ban a few words from appearing in the comments so for example i've banned the word telegram i've banned the word whatsapp so if people are using that and spelling it the same way that i've filtered it then it shouldn't appear in the comments but the scammers have started to find a way around this now because instead of writing a comment they're just creating a new account and changing their profile name to something like you've won a prize dm me on telegram jackfrags and they draw attention to that by using some emojis like top or pointing up so you'll then be reading the profile name and sometimes they even put their phone numbers in the profile names and as far as telegram goes i only recently actually found out what that was i don't have a telegram account and after researching it i think that these scammers use it because telegram is said to be heavily encrypted and the messages can actually self-destruct the only social media that i kind of use a youtube obviously i reply in the comments twitter as well my discord that's it really and the annoying thing is as far as i know the filters that i have for the comments don't filter out the usernames so they slip through the net and that means that at the moment there's not really a solution to this for me personally there's no way that i can put an end to this right now the only thing that i can do is to be as responsive to it as possible and if i see those comments i'll remove them hide the user from the channel and then i'll keep doing it i guess and then i'll just do it again like i said it's a losing battle so i'm just trying to inform you that this is happening don't get caught up in it and don't fall for it now some things to look out for you'll know that it's my comment and my reply in a youtube comment if it's got the gray background and it's got the tick next to it that means that i'm a verified creator on youtube so always look out for that if someone who's saying that they're me has replied to you and on twitter i've got the verified tick on there too and i only have one twitter account so again watch out for that there are people on twitter who have similar names to me and sometimes the things they say get attributed to me because people are skim reading or they're just instant replying and they're not actually looking at the account name it's not me look at the profile is it me does it have the tick so if it's not come from any of those verified sources then don't trust it don't reply don't send them your details it's not my account the one funny thing about this is that i've been looking through and getting screenshots of these comments so i can show you guys what they look like sometimes they actually end up replying to themselves or replying to bots so here you can see one of the scammers has replied to a bot that's copied a real comment saying dm me on telegram that will not get you anywhere now another element to this which again i see people falling for this sometimes on twitter if a player on battlefield whether that's bf5 2042 or somebody on war zone has had their account banned and they claim hey i wasn't cheating i've been banning correctly can you help me jack there's a few times that people have tweeted me and said can you help me out with this account ban to start with i can't do anything if your account gets banned i can't help you i guess the only thing that you could do is appeal it through the official channels and see what happens with that but what i've noticed is that when people use that kind of language occasionally a bot will actually reply to them and say hey we can help you with this follow this twitter account and dm them and they can get your account unbanned and they claim that because they say oh they helped me with my account when it was wrongly banned and once again this is a scam and what these people are doing is trying to get your account details or commonly used passwords and hack your other accounts maybe you have another warzone account maybe you have a gmail with the same password and if they get those accounts they can sell them they can use them let's say you've been banned on warzone but you use the same password for battlefield they hack that account they change the password and what they'll do is they actually sell these accounts on cheating websites so people can pay for them and cheat on a new account that hasn't been banned so that's one to look out for as well the lengths that these people will go to it's pretty extreme and in terms of doing giveaways on my channel i've not really done that many over the 10 plus years or so that i've been a content creator on youtube and i certainly wouldn't just randomly reply to someone in the comments and say hey you've won something and in fact any that i've done in the past it was very obvious it was in the video you'll hear me say we're sponsored by asus today we're doing a giveaway for a new gaming laptop or a graphics card or something like that and then i'll draw your attention to a link in the description where you can click and there'll be like a legitimate form and it will be very obvious that this is like an official thing that i'm doing so i will never just reply to anyone in the comments and say text me or message me on whatsapp or telegram and that's all really i think i've covered everything that i wanted to cover there just a bit of a psa i suppose i don't want anyone that watches my videos to get stung by this so be vigilant look twice think twice and spread the word that this kind of stuff happens and that's it for today thank you for watching once again hope the gameplay was decent let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked the vid leave a like subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye
