let's be honest it's left for dead three and everything but name in it now valve seems to have a issue creating a third game for their major franchises just ask gordon freeman and there aren't many games that fans have anticipated more than half-life three but left for dead three well that's been teased data mined and rumored for years apparently all in vain or was it to explain what's going on with the game you're seeing here back for blood you really need to understand the studio behind it and their history you may know turtle rock studios more recently for evolve and while it was an interesting concept that game never really lived up to its potential but they also worked on counter-strike condition zero cs source and half-life 2 deathmatch and when they went evolve with an idea for a zombie game valve helped with the funding and publishing and left the dead was born and just before the release of that game valve announced that it had purchased turtle rock studios and they would henceforth be known as valve south i won't bore you with a long history lesson but it didn't go all that well and valve allowed the studio to separate from them and use the turtle rock name once more sadly though valve kept the rights for left for dead they owned the ip and while turtle rock weren't directly responsible for left 4 dead 2 they did work on some post launch content so despite the split with valve the companies remained close fast forward to today though and we've got some new gameplay of something called back for blood and it's quite obvious to anyone who has played left 4 dead that there are some striking similarities in the gameplay and also of course the name back for blood is absolutely a spiritual successor to the left 4 dead franchise and there are still a lot of developers working at turtle rock that had a hand in crafting the original game good news first of all you won't have long to wait before the game releases it's due to launch on pc next gen and current gen consoles in june 2021 it's also got a closed alpha starting this week so if that interests you head over to their website to register i've spent a lot of time basically saying that this is left 4 dead 3 but the important thing to remember is that this is a new ip and because of that turtle rock can take this game in any direction that they want and while for us fans we will definitely feel familiar with it and it will have a ton of elements that are almost exactly the same as they were in left 4 dead it's still its own new game and to that end it's also not running on the source engine but instead it will utilize unreal engine 4. the core gameplay well as you can see that's mostly the same it will have a full story campaign that you can play solo or with three other friends and let's be honest that's where the fun begins in this type of game and because it's a different ip turtle rock are free to do what they want with the setting and the backstory which could lead to some more interesting gameplay elements one thing is for sure though based on the gameplay the beloved safe room still exists and of course this is a zombie survival mode and while there are hordes of normal zombies if you want to call them that there are of course the special zombies that offer up more of a challenge although the general term for the zombies in back for blood is the ridden and the playable characters are called cleaners when it comes to the special type of ridden zombies it sounds weird saying that we first have the stinger and this will probably remind players of the hunter from left for dead the stinger can pounce on you from a substantial distance and they've also got four arms nasty the wretch can vomit of acid on you so you don't want to get too close to him and of course they'll remind you a lot of the boomer and then the tall boy interesting name essentially has a giant hammer fist that he can aim at you so keeping your distance is preferred and later in the game play the tall boy is also called a bruiser so either the name isn't yet final or it's simply an enemy type or placeholder and if you thought the tank from the original series was terrifying wait until you fight the ogre a massive monstrosity and genuinely terrifying you'll need to hit his weak spot to take him down this is a small sample and i'm sure that the full game will have way more special infected on release and extra content down the line my only question would be can turtle rock come up with something that's as terrifying as the witch again i remember the first time that i played left 4 dead and that encounter was just so unnerving experiencing it for the first few times but can the witch be topped we'll have to wait and see i mentioned cleaners and in back for blood these are what the playable characters are there will be eight of them on release and if it follows in the same pattern as left for dead they will vary depending on what story element that you're playing in the campaign but during the alpha test you'll be able to get your hands on four of them walker holly evangelo and hoffman every character in left 4 dead was great because they all had their individual personalities and voice lines and of course that's the same here each of them will also have a unique character perk and melee weapon so one of the main goals with this game is replayability and that was one of the big pluses with the original left for dead and left for dead too left for dead had something called a game director and this was an ai system that would change up the game in terms of pacing and difficulty based on what the human players were doing it could vary spawn points of enemies and items to ensure that the game always felt different and a challenge every time that you played and that same director is back in back for blood the director will constantly adjust to the player's actions to ensure that no play through is the same it can change up enemy locations but also enemy types as well as mixing up the locations of items weapons and even change the environment itself sounds great to me so far and the things that you'll find in the world to be able to loot will include ammo health weapons weapon sights and they'll all be in different places every time that you play to further add to that there is a card system present in the game the cards offer up unique experiences and challenges every time you play when you enter a new game the game director at ai overlord will choose some cards for that playthrough called corruption cards and the idea for this is to make the game different and challenging and it could mean spawning larger hordes of enemies adding fog so it's harder to see or making ammo incredibly scarce there was something similar in left 4 dead 2 and then players can add to this with their own cards too and this means that players will be able to add in their own selection that can both make things harder or easier depending on the card that you play they could range from gaining melee damage faster healing gaining health at the cost of stamina fire resistance etc there's a whole bunch that you can choose from and these cards can be earned by completing challenges and objectives and in the final game players will then be able to almost make their own custom deck of cards that they can use when they're playing with friends and it does seem like you'll be able to have a unique experience across all players and that's certainly the goal here wrapping things up we haven't really talked about it yet but there will be a multiplayer component as well we don't have a lot of information on it but expect player controlled special zombies fighting a team of player controlled cleaners plus the zombie ai in hordes and i imagine that you won't be too far off left 4 dead had a great versus mode in the past and i imagine this will be the same obviously games have come a long way since 2009 and it has to be said that lots of games in recent times have tried to replicate the success of left 4 dead with varying results so can turtle rock prove to us that they are the ones with the magic touch i hope so it looks like a lot of fun i love the left for dead games and i can't wait to get stuck into this looks like a blast it's gonna be great playing it with mates and with that said thank you for watching guys if i get access to the alpha this week i'll probably stream it at some point on youtube so do look out for that and like i said try it out for yourself could be good and that's all for today
