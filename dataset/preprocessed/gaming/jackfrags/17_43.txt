oh baby we are back on bf4 today look at this game isn't it gorgeous i've got the sr2 which is like a really fast firing smg fountain playing as engineer i'm playing on a map here called hammerhead i don't know why i thought this actually i'm sure a guy just ran in there didn't it he's dead everyone's dead you're not dead you're dead look how fast it fires there's one more there oh this gun is awesome i've decked it out as well got a little grip on it jesus oh there's another one there can we get another one yes we can wow what an opening six kills yeah i put a grip on it i think there's more of those stairs isn't that hello over the iron sights as well that's a cheeky little claim oh there this guy right here oh my god that guy just absolutely annihilated me i typed so quickly then we're going back in nice respawn they were up there weren't they but there was a blog today for bf 2042 but it was patch notes and i thought that instead of doing a video on that tonight i would actually he just went is that real i'll just do it tomorrow when the patch is out you know that might be better because then i can actually show the changes and whatnot i don't know what those noises were oh i'm gonna get a cheeky res hello dice ma i don't know what happened there we go back out here man i love these maps look at this that broken submarine there you kidding i didn't even get an assist for that wait unless they're not dead oh my god the time to kill you get the head shot man's got the alienware logo on his tank what's going on yeah just fired over this bit is awesome right at the back there well it doesn't fire as fast as the s'more in portal but it's still pretty damn quick it's still pretty fun god eat it yes i will never ever ever get bored of hitting infantry with rocket launchers in this game it's just something so satisfying about it they're gonna take it oh they dodged that one i reckon that went through the middle of them maybe perhaps i was a little bit suppressed there right before i fired yes in the face robbie topher i'm so sorry all right dude we're doing some good medicine right here man i'm proud of you you know when they announced 2042 i really thought that they were gonna lean into more of this style of gameplay and this setting oh i'm stuck on the ladder but there isn't really much of this kind of stuff yet there might be though in that blog today they did say that season one is officially releasing next month so it's gonna be june that's a massive ladder isn't it i gotta cut this i can't just be talking the whole time while i'm climbing this ladder but can i maybe can i keep you guys entertained enough maybe you could like the video whilst i'm climbing the ladder so i know you guys like watching be a full gameplay because every time i post a video it pops off so i hope that you liked the video right then if you didn't then a fairy somewhere just died that's the harsh reality of the situation okay i made that up aren't fairy's ow what the hell was that oh it's a sniper right there sorry i'll rephrase there was a sniper there i'm in a weird mood today oh by the way today is the first day that i'm coldly negative i actually i've been doing tests every day and the first like four or five days the line was like super like you've got kobe's sorry and then it's just started getting like more faded and faded by the day and today is actually the first day where i can't see anything this guy's still here i'm lucky so i'm officially corona free now which is good i don't have any more symptoms really either but i still can't taste or smell anything and you know i heard about that obviously people who've talked about it and on the gov websites it's like this is an official symptom of covered and i just was like nah that ain't that ain't a thing and it totally is so weird you've got all these preconceived notions of how things should taste and how they should smell and then you just get nothing you put them in your mouth and it's nothing that helicopter is absolutely crazy i wish i really wish i had some ammo left can we stop now please i barely got amber left in this thing as well i'm dead [Applause] that was awesome look how quick they could turn go on go on go on go on ah i misjudged it that jet is flying like an absolute mad lad what the hell are you gonna come back here jet come on yeah come back come back let's go almost i mean if it goes for me i'm gonna have it for breakfast lunch and dinner come on come get me i'm here oh [Applause] that's infantry not like this i'm dead and the tank's gonna kill me hey i've got some big logs to defend me though which is good i can go above them as well oh there's another one damn you nobody expects a second tank it's a us server it is isn't it 107 117 hello ma i am master chief i'm not master chief that's a lie i need to watch the show it's still not available to watch in the uk legally we don't get paramount plus so look at the ice break in here that's so cool can you oh wait you can do this yourself can't you yes nice bit of evolution burn it away you can just burn the ice away yeah i really need to watch that show i know a lot of people when it came out were like uh it's kind of bad but from what i've heard and from what i've read online it does actually get better but i'll be the judge of that you know i'll watch it i'm gonna watch it anyway just because it's halo but do correct me if i'm wrong it's not connected to the games it's kind of got its own canon which you know that's a bit weird isn't it was that the heart attack shooting at me you gonna stand there and take it are you going that way i suppose the hobbytown doesn't really care about the ic though right clearly not now there are people on the radar are they down here what are you firing my friend there's a dude right there coming in here now another one i'm gonna nade that did my knee just mess up then i think it did no we got it johnny drama there's so many enemies here oh my god how did i manage to get off a kill there that was so lucky what's going on with these bloody grenades evil lads i just absolutely plowed my teammate in the back of the head there come on we gotta push let's go clear it out there's a claymore there as well watch out the claymore it's fine it's fine good job that's something just dropped to nade oh that's clever look at this they're all dropping down like flies there's another one is there more god i feel like i should go up there so i get this assault kit what is it m416 with a nade launcher guys we are going up the ladder again if you've not already liked the video now is a great moment to like the video this is like that moment in metal gear solid two was it two or was it three snakey so where there's just a giant ladder and it lasts like five minutes and it's just kojima trolling everyone i love it yeah but apparently that covered symptom of not being able to smell or taste anything that does return but a lot of people tweeted me and were like yeah i had that and it took like a year for my smell and taste to come back so good luck i can't wait for not being able to taste the smelling thing for a whole year i'll take it as an opportunity to eat a load of food that's good for me that tastes disgusting [Laughter] you know you gotta you gotta make the most of these situations can i grenade to that dude there's a lot coming in oh this m416 man gun playing this game it's just supreme i love it so much character to it i know i've said that before are you gonna put a little flank though quite get the kill that guy's gonna prone nice finish them off in the end i've still got two grenades left dude this map is sick how sick is this map thank you there's a hover tank there dunk dunk that was close oh he's going for the jump oh my god the atmosphere in this game i'm out of ammo ah oh the hover tank's gonna get me just this map man check this out dude so good the particle effects with the snow the lighting the sky box it's just got it all doesn't it it's got everything i need ammo damn it can i drive this truck i don't think i can no oh no poor infantry up there wait for it wait for it is that the one is that the shot oh what we got a hit marker it didn't kill him i think it was a little bit short there that would have been an epic grenade launcher kill let's see if they're still here though what do you reckon yeah right there i could go for the tags this guy is completely unaware oh brutal give me this iron v sks what else have you got that looks like a nicer kit to be honest oh man ebr [Music] just take this in just take this in how good was this game look at this just look at it this counts as kill i'll have it what have i got here it's an engineer kit yeah it is i think it's that guy's kit isn't it looks like it's the same one into it ah i know you guys want to see that i know that's what you want to see you want to see one of those nice helicopter shots it's a lock on rocket that all right snowmobile why not let's go i don't know where we're going but we're going somewhere should we go to a yeah i've not been to a yeah oh baby we are leaving tracks in the snow we are rapid right now what is it the doc says violent speed momentum that's us right now that's a helicopter that's a tank you're gonna rip that are you oh no oh no he's got the south park characters look at that is that a medic next to me yes thank you so much man you're the best what a legend thank them see anyone in it wait did they just abandon it maybe if they've abandoned that tank i'm taking it no it's smoking wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we can repair it we can save it and we can use it hopefully i don't get smacked right here we go free tank

needle yes okay kill assist it's dead good right there's a lot of infantry over there as well look a grenade right there on there to hp that incendiary grenade nearly killed me oh there's a little
