on the playstation 3. that's a difficult game this this is harder than demon souls it really is i completed it the whole thing 100 this is the hardest thing i've ever done in my life university degree nah that's gone colonoscopy with no sedation this is tougher than that i mean i had double jaw surgery the full mandibular osteosomy they move the bottom jaw back seven millimeters they move the top jaw forward three millimeters six months of recovery two to three years of dental work in terms of braces before that happened incredible pain this is more difficult okay at least i'm the imposter this round so i don't have to do that stupid card thing anymore but i can use it to my advantage i'm just gonna pretend to do this okay matt saw me coming here sorry bong's here as well matt's just checking this is a long con this one oh somebody's stuck there i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it [Music] um what's going on in here what's going on is that body reported yeah so i was doing the upload date huh mug tell me i did it by the way i finally did it you did it no i turned v-sync off and it worked yeah go i wanted to do the upload with mugs i've been following mugs the whole time we did the navigation we did the shield i followed him into admin where he had to admit to the upload data i was on the upload data thing with bong and mugs jack i could just see on the table i come off the upload data mugs is dead bong's know what to be seen i've reported okay i was in i was in at full disclosure i was in admin as well during the campaign again he i didn't see but maybe you're also an admin doing downloads as well and mother was a live okay maybe it wasn't maybe it was like i thought it was blue maybe it was i saw a black character um wasn't that been i was in i got to electrical by the time you reported the body right okay but that's but i was doing the uploads but everybody was alive in admin when i left so right hmm it's weird it's a ballsy ballsy move isn't it there was a lot of us in there long long run off to electric by this point so he could have done it and run that's all i'm saying evelyn possible as well i mean i don't know uh accusations i started i'm reporting the facts like this is not an accusation i'm saying i saw you on it i did the upload i came off the body was saying you weren't there anymore everything i think was there jack and how to do in the swipe where was that's fact that's it i'm i think i've got their trust now and they believe me with the card thing i can't kill lala because she's like may suspect [Music] what's the deal no one's dead can i talk yeah do you have anything to self say welsh real quick no okay tommy came out of event i was on cameras wait there's no fence on the camps what yeah there's no events on the campus for
