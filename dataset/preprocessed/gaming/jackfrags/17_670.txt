would never judge you like that yeah exactly we would never judge you for that very stupid decision Wow woody will you touch me after you touch me now Andrew doesn't matter I'm gonna die no matter where we landed it's easier to bury me in a quarry anyway he's between us I think behind the door John through all those sounds certainly mad dies though I'm actually I'm actually too good kind of bad

do yeah yeah alright three to do what didn't work listen I've got a good idea okay I'm gonna go there what is it not dying vanish that's honestly not a bad idea and now vanish at the back vanish and vanish and vanish and vanish I was a bit late with the smoke but I'm still vanishing vanish I can smell burnt toast it's not supposed to mean that you're having a heart attack or something in real life or in the game in real life okay I think you'll be fine you're feeling healthy short you'll be all right I have two kills I'm feeling good the more kills you have in video games the healthier you are in real life how it works oh if only then I would be the healthiest man on the planet Jack I just feel like we should just take stock and just chill you know I just want to chill we should just back off jack off and regroup yes let's go okay well Andrew what you doing I'm starting a little for tower this is not conducive to us winning the game do is it smoking's bad for you stop it Han drew yes Stroeve yes nice nice nice nice I got a Molotov can I put that on it huh if I balance it it like just right on it one then we just make a dragon yeah but if I throw the Molotov at the drone inside it on fire and then you throw it at someone else I have to admit I like the idea yeah I've not seen that level of imagination for a while that's it they just they're just cool they just want Andrew what's going on Andrew you're dying they're just boys boys boys probably not I'm Sean I'm scared I he's spamming buttons he's talking in tongues I think the devil's got him get the holy water get the holy water and the Blessed Mary are they enemies here Andrew is that what you're trying to say they're gonna be down down boo boo boo are you just all that forward has he been exorcised yet sure no I'm not sure I don't know you're in the water no Andrew splash around in it a little yeah Lord bless us and save us all right he's good like you thank you so much that was good to go for a minute yeah people think exorcisms are hard really not you just got a you got a bit a little devil oh dear I don't smell burnt toast anymore I don't there's loadouts here ooh that's much better yeah it's gonna pair those rocks any second oh god watch out oh no no doubt drop oh I got in the window did you see that that was epic let him do you think yeah yeah definitely oh they're fighting someone guys not for their oh yeah let's not go that way god oh he's right there there he's I saw the left and they're right Oh Andrew can we just go can we go guys to loadout sure whatever you do don't land on us one more I just seen nothing but bullets flying overhead did you get him no he's very low there's one left I'm gonna crawl back I mean you could drop on me and revive me Sean I'll do it I'm getting there as fast as I can now what's gonna happen is you're gonna start reviving me and they're gonna kill us both and then I'm the only one to blame yeah they are running right towards you jack okay yeah okay we're ruined I predicted the prophecy is true I'm very sorry it's all my fault Oh what I did I shouldn't have even suggested it oh I'm so sorry yeah why did you do it right there Andrew get that scavenger there's a buy station there respawn is both we're back in the game imagine if you could spend real money to respawn yourself dude people would kick off you could do that literally pay to win yeah they could quite possibly be the worst microtransaction idea ever put into a game like that a game must have done 9 the pasta right surely in the Wild West days right when everything was just like now what ever buy anything you want my station where you can actually buy Tings yeah amazing must have been a free-to-play game like in the early days where you could do that I reckon back to back to back Andrew fact what confusing I'm Jack thank you get sure he's better than me oh it's too late get the liar she wants to get chat dead well played under good luck Shawn I've got this don't worry about it see that legendary alright where did that other she fancy some Snipes team white there you go nice must have been on his own I do not like this under the bridge situation I don't mind
