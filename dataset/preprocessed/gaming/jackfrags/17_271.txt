battlefield 2042 just dropped a cinematic video in the form of exodus i'm not going to show it in this video because i think it's pretty cool i don't want to spoil it but essentially all you need to know is that it reintroduces the characters of irish and pack from battlefield 4 confirming that bf 2042 is in fact a sequel in a way to battlefield 4 it's in the same universe as that game was and this cinematic sets up the story narrative and law of some of the events just before battlefield 2042 so if you're into that kind of thing it's a bit of world building for you and michael k williams is back as irish he's provided the motion capture and audio work here there was also an announcement about irish being a playable character in the game irish is in fact a specialist in battlefield 2042 and that means that we now know five of them officially what they do who they are and what their abilities are so we're going to take a look at irish now and exactly what they offer and there's some really interesting things here that we haven't learned before and they do have some big gameplay implications we were showing a few gameplay snippets behind the scenes yesterday in a presentation of irish showing what his abilities are like i don't know if they're going to release those publicly they were quite short anyway but we're going to dive into everything now so irish's class is an engineer and his speciality is the fortification system with the trait of veteran and as an engineer irish is a great asset to any team that fortification system has two parts to it as well and it allows him to place down two separate items into the world one of them is the dcs deployable cover and the other one is an aps-36 shoot down sentinel so a little bit of a deep dive into each of these now the dcs deployable cover imagine just a big shield going up in front of you with a solid base and then a bulletproof glass at the top you can place the cover on nearly any flat surface and this creates a small protective barrier that allows your allies to see out through its bulletproof glass this barrier can protect you and allies from incoming fire until its health pool is depleted and if you're playing as irish you can place multiple covers on a map it didn't say how many in total they gave the gameplay scenario here do you need to revive someone do you need to protect yourself against a sniper attack when you stuck out in the open hold the capture point for just a few more precious seconds well using multiple covers you can create your own small outpost to help you buy time obtaining some medical and ammo crates and teaming up with boris and his sentry gun will allow you to build your own castle-like fort so teaming up with a different specialist there boris little meta gameplay moment there and then the aps-36 this is a rocket's worst nightmare and you place this into the world again on nearly any flat surface and it will destroy incoming explosive projectiles with proximity so stuff like grenades rockets that kind of thing turning a once deadly weapon into a simple puff of smoke and they gave another example here of gameplay placing the aps next to a vehicle will give it automatic protection from incoming missiles so vehicle players relying on their infantry to help them out there and then something else like this if you placed it behind cover you could force an enemy to reposition in their attack but beware because emps or savvy hack attacks can put the system out of action and then irish's trait is called veteran this is a really interesting one because maybe there's more to this irish's veteran trait allows him to dig in and stay alive he will always spawn with a small amount of body armor that can be replenished whenever he collects dropped ammo packs from defeated foes body armor is a pretty big deal if you could be a specialist that had more health or more damage reduction against bullets for example and it looks like you can replenish it too so i imagine that irish is going to be quite a strong pick at launch perhaps you could build your gun though so you've got armor piercing grounds or something so that will negate those effects i don't know and they gave us some images that we could share here too of irish in his different skins a couple of different ones here like the battle hardened one for example so different specialists in 2042 will have customization different looks to them and that's all for now really that's all of the interesting stuff that came out of this again go and check out the video for yourself if you're interested it is about nine minutes long so a bit of a time commitment but you might enjoy it but it does make me wonder will we see any other battlefield 4 characters in this game knowing that it's a sequel will we see characters from battlefield 3 will we see rekka as a specialist maybe although yeah they were kind of a voiceless protagonist in bf4 so maybe not but this does confirm that at the end of bf4 spoiler alert you get a choice between who to save do you want to save hana or do you want to say irish and it looks like the canon ending is irish lives so sorry to all those hana stands out there also i do apologize if my mic or the video sounds a bit weird i'm in a hotel recording this at the moment not on my usual setup so might sound a bit different and that's all guys thank you
