today we're taking a look at season 9 of apex otherwise known as legacy and it's one of the biggest updates the game has had so far with some surprising additions map changes a brand new legend linked to titanfall and a permanent new game mode called arena that's completely separate from br a big thanks to ea for sponsoring the video today and with that said let's dive in and take a look so i played all this in an event last week i had a few hours to test everything we're starting off with valkyrie the new legend her father was the pilot from titanfall 2 viper and probably the most interesting of her abilities are the veto jets it's a passive ability that allows her to use the jets to propel herself into the air you do have quite a bit of control here too and it's achieved by pressing jump a second time when you're in the air and you can begin to float so you can still utilize jumping if you need to you do have limited fuel though and it reduces pretty fast the recharge time is quite long too so you don't really want to be using it all at once and then not have any fuel when you're in a pinch secondly while maneuverability is pretty good in the air you're still a fairly easy target to track valkyrie's tactical ability is her cluster missile as the name would suggest you unleash a cluster of missiles at your enemy with a shoulder targeting system this has two purposes not only can you deal damage to your target if they're within the radius but more importantly they also get stunned and i found this really useful for separating enemies from their team and when you get a successful stun the enemy will have an electric charge around them making sure you know that they've got limited movement and it's time to attack her ultimate is all about repositioning though and it's called skyward it allows valkyrie to launch into the air getting extremely high before then skydiving down to another part of the map this can either be used to reposition defensively or offensively and what's great about this is that teammates can latch on to her and go along for the ride take your whole team with you and when you're in the air it just acts like the initial skydive from the plane where valkyrie will decide the location of the team unless they want to branch off also if you come across an enemy valkyrie using her cluster missiles try not to run away from them in a straight line because they form a grid of 12. so make sure that you don't run straight into them also once you fire them you can just move and they'll find their way to the target location there's a really cool nod here to the north star titan from titanfall 2 which had an ultimate called flight core which makes sense since viper's father's titan was the north star titan a nice touch i really enjoyed playing valve but i do think i need a bit more time to get efficient with her vtol jets it's a great ability but using it at the right times is so important they're incredibly strong but if you use them incorrectly you could end up being a sitting duck another thing to remember is that her jets are incredibly loud if you're playing a vr mode you can really pinpoint where a valkyrie is by just listening to where those sounds are coming from now there's a lot to cover here so we're moving on now to the arena mode and this is something that i found really exciting and fun to play it's literally called arenas apex as we know it in the past has always been about that battle royale experience but arenas is completely different and entirely separate and permanent this is not a limited time mode arenas is a 3v3 competitive mode set on its own custom maps so let me give you the basic concept of it before we get into the finer details you've got two teams of three and then you pick your legends like you normally would and then you go into an arena where the only way to win is to eliminate the other team do so and you'll get a point or around and it's first of three rounds to win but you have to win by two clear rounds to at least give a losing team a chance if it's a tie there'll be a sudden death arenas take place on custom maps party crasher is a downship that mirage lost control of and plowed into a downtown plaza naughty naughty phase runner is an early prototype version of the phase runner pipe and there will be new locations added and current map pois will also pad out the map pool one thing that sets this apart though from your typical team deathmatch fight is that there's an economy system here brand new game mechanics at the start of each round you've got to purchase your gear as well as your abilities shields and grenades do well in a round and you'll gain more currency to have a better buy in the following ground not only that but there are canisters around the map that will give you and your team extra currency for the following round and as i played i realized the importance of picking these up while there's no real looting in this mode there are supply pods around the level that have healing items and as you have to buy them it can be really useful to get control of these alongside that there will be a large drop pod which will bring in better weapons during the round at the beginning of each round it will tell you what will be contained in that drop so depending on if you're winning or losing it may be worth going for it it's important to know though that weapons do not carry a cross between rounds once the round ends even if you survive everything's gone you've got to purchase your gear again the longer the game goes on though the more currency you get each round and the better armor is provided to you if the game goes to sudden death as i said there'll be a deadlock and you get more money than you know what to do with it's basically anything goes at that point each weapon can also be upgraded for money this gives you better attachments and scopes it's a simple enough system so you don't have to worry about picking each attachment and i found that in arena picking off the enemy was so critical to success and utilizing your abilities and not wasting them was really important for flushing enemies out i noticed lots of tactics of sitting back and picking players with snipers knowing that shields are in short supply this is actually a good tactic the bow was also an incredibly powerful weapon in the arena too yes that's a brand new weapon and i had an absolute blast playing with it it's got a very high dps but high skill ceiling a bit like a wingman in that respect but i'm glad that there's a bow in a pvp game that doesn't suck and with it comes a new class of ammo arrows and what's cool about these arrows is that you can pick them back up which you'll need to because in br they are fairly rare they will stick to surfaces and if you get a kill on some other you hit with an arrow you'll find them in their death box something interesting i found with the arrows though is that if an enemy misses you but you don't know where they shot from because it's quite quiet you can use the angle where that arrow impacted in a wall to guide you and give yourself a better idea of where that shot came from it's not completely silent though it is quieter than most weapons but definitely a stealthier option the bow also has two hop-up slots that you can use at the same time one is the shatter caps which changes the arrow into one which shatters on impact almost turning it into a shotgun pellet great for short range and then deadeye's tempo allows you to get a faster draw if you can fire the arrows at the perfect tempo so releasing the bow at the perfect time it's actually a lot harder to do that you might think and it will definitely take a bit of practice getting used to in arena though i found myself picking up the bow but not actually upgrading it i found that my money was better spent elsewhere and if you land your shots you can use the bow incredibly effectively even at longer ranges arena mode was a blast i absolutely loved it it's a new form of gameplay for apex and i'm sure that there's big plans from ea maybe to do competitive tournaments on this down the line i'd love to see the best apex players in the world going at this and i'd love to see more new game modes in the future of course this changes to olympus 2 the last map that they added and a rather big one that you'd be hard-pressed to miss a mysterious craft crash-landed onto the surface the icarus and sadly it did not come alone it's brought with it a huge parasitic plant of unknown origin that slowly consumed the ship i feel like there's a big story here coming in and we'll find more about this as time goes on the ship is located where crossroads used to be and it's a huge place of interest it's massive and it's a pretty cool tdm style area to fight over if you can find one of the dead crewmates they might also have a bridge card on them and this will let you access the bridge with plenty of loot overall there's a ton of stuff in this update and that's not even touching on any of the balance changes that they made with the patch arena mode very interesting to me especially if you play with the full squad communicating versus another squad could get incredibly competitive there are a lot of tactics to be had in relation to what you and your teammates want to buy and how to control certain areas and i'm really interested to see how it progresses and how it's received there's a big opportunity here for clutch moments 1v3s big plays with abilities and also gun skill with that said that's all for today folks do let me know your thoughts so far on apex season 9 and it's all going to kick off for everyone on the 4th of may if you enjoyed the video guys leave a like if
