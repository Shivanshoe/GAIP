hi guys hope you're all doing well and welcome back to more call of duty warzone today i'm going to be playing with study and mr pro westy but before we jump into things i wanted to show you this if you load up modern warfare and go to the store they just added a new bundle for rose called behind the mask and you can actually see what rose looks like there you go who knew he's got piercing blue eyes but we're going to buy this bundle today and also use the m13 because this has got acid rounds in it and apparently these were voted by some kind of community pool i don't know what acid rounds look like i don't know if there's any like in the game yet already [Applause] so we're gonna pick those up and we're gonna make a delightful m13 build using that blueprint we'll need to jump back into warzone uh just a heads up guys as well if you buy anything in the store do consider using my creator code which is jack frags and all caps and anything you buy i'll get a bit of kickback from that right see if the boys are ready hello good to go okay we're good to go nevermind wesley i bought i bought four in you come jack come on let's go let's hop drop straight into the game i need to change my operator in war zone don't i do you need to you need to get rose to take her mask off here we go the torn veil kind of looks like a tomb raider outfit doesn't it for the old tomb raider games yes it does that's maybe what they were going for why are the grenades covered in um the grenades are covered in fur they're not are they grenades furry grenades i think ah yes um it could be grenades m13 it's a weird looking gun but the m13 yeah you use the exact one no i'm not going to use the exact one i'm going to change it a little bit because the barrel's too short that's what she said hello site maybe yeah yeah the hollow site's still on it i think you're good with that okay here we go let's have some fun first game of the day is it going to be full sweat or is it going to be okay bronze bronze five let's go okay okay it's taking a little while to load i still have the invisibility glitch in this game for the character yes yeah i think sorry how is that check your gear reload planes are making ready blackboard okay they should change it but they won't take it out because if someone paid for it i bet there's some like legal thing about they can't they can't disable it or whatever that that by boat's getting real close you know has it moved again i'm not seeing it today it's it's full of rose skins coming to infect but dance [ __ ] i wonder how many other people will be using the new roasting no one you got everyone's like that's a nice skin it's not as good as the other rose skin though look at us hey cool look at us look at us yeah i know i mean we're twins as well so you know it's double the effect on the enemy is that how it works double the distraction soldier you've got gas closing in there's another in high level lobbies if you all use the same skin it's actually very beneficial as opposed to giving away because otherwise some people like oh he's the uh default skin's low deep he's low and then he's dead um well the tv tv yeah let's go that's where we're getting hot drop potty droppy oh we're right underneath it here oh god we we're very late is this a good idea pull up here pull up that's fine it was just tv station bounty i just picked it up straight away and i was above them that's all that's all right fine oh self-rest early game dude i literally just pick one up as well look at that what a treat yeah same same we both got the rose skins we both got you're a liar no no no i can see our survey says the study was lying not for far say that never ignore the ground loot for far all growser though what's better ground loot for far grows and more bullets more bullets you get the bullets yeah yeah man the safari is just so good right now godly but in a few days guys is it going to be ground loot anymore are they going to take it away probably i'm telling you right now it's going to be i think drops there it's going to be standing ground loop and um what else we're going to get we're going to get lw3 standard okay and what about some of the new guns do we need some of the new ones they've got the galil and the lc10 you think it will actually be ground lake they'll have like a legendary blueprint of it right yeah for sure do you want to get lordy yeah well we have to go to the neighborhood i think or suburbia sweatsville oh there's people fighting in switzerland it's fine we'll just go and fight them okay nothing nothing bad can happen they can just look out the windows and kill us and sleep down beautifully there's one further back is i mean we could pop our daddies if you want yeah i've got one where's the third player though well one's on blue building and i think they were fighting someone else which is why we saw them shoot so there's like two different teams there glassblowing me on blue i flashed he's in my bunny he's right here one of his near my body uh no he's got an aimbot it's got a name really yeah straight well unless it was a super laggy killcam i think he would have killed me there cam if you had a name but okay then i must have had the glitchiest kill cam in history it must have missed a full 60 frames uh are we close todd i don't know let's go let's go to the bottom yeah yeah we've got enough to res as well yeah we do we do drop it oh you've got the money yeah there might be another team here which is why they were shooting in the first place don't kill the guy in the goo lag i don't know uh yeah he did it he had a super super glitchy kill cam that made it look like he had a name but hey there i've had that all right i'm getting your i'm getting your pp young and the other young uh here you go thank you thank you very much oh it makes a little acid splash on the ground look at that yeah yeah look hey no one's ever gonna see your shots now oh god i don't know i regret doing this now wait wait does it stick to people stand still no it goes straight through you what no can i take a look at your face camera enemy uav overhead oh my god okay broke him he's not down i told you there was another team it did no one listened to me yeah he's gone inside 34 minutes i've only got a 30 round mag in it as well on the fall was it just one guy okay for me as he's inside the building uh daddy rush here go for it even knee daddy he's downstairs he's downstairs somewhere has he gone where did he go i checked upstairs okay he ran away then all right did he go where did he go i've got no bullets what do you need cam uh i used she's got some pretty piercing blue eyes very easy that's the difference there's two two two players two players oh he managed to eat through the building and kill me it's the other player he's just actually instantly killed me i got sniped by someone from a completely different squad in the woods yeah i got killed by the the skin we were looking for i'm cool with it i'm cool with it long gulag as well oh no you're both dead it's all on you jack ah no i don't want it i'm gonna get a double deagle or something i don't know nice assault rifles in a good lag at the moment complimentary reset you're done yeah time to earn your freedom soldier [Applause] are you just afk nice uh what options do i have um jump off a bridge in the game uh press escape you scroll down to uh the fifth option uh i could do that maybe get the truck i'll go there and get the truck well there's a heli there isn't there where's that heli you think i could do that yeah you could probably do that yeah although there is a guy here and there's a guy on that building ah you'll be fine nothing wrong with no one shooting at me or anything let's go let's go seal chain seal team jack go go go i think there is a squad here isn't there uh well it was earlier that's like the worst buy station as well i'm so dead sniper on the roof there's one on the bike

yeah that one more someone he's only got him [Music] he's pushing behind the aircraft he hasn't played it though nice he's just gonna be right here he's played it up oh no yeah i mean wait i needed the helicopter didn't i yeah he needed that heli you got 20 seconds you could still get a free res yeah i got this i think yeah big plays big place pogba's nine eight seven six and he's got it look at that i'll come back your payment has been authorized you see they made the mistake of pushing you one by one there as well like why i don't know why they didn't just wait plus stocks now i know i'm

crap there we go there's going to be some more in here downstairs again in the toilets there's a little bit more very nice you reckon that team are coming down um no there's two teams there's one on the loadout and then there's one on the hills as well and for some reason they didn't shoot each other they're just ignoring each other as usual probably because one's not looking down the hill to the other side i'm gonna go over there there's a vehicle down there on the left you could nick i'm sure it's not got c4 on it that buy station i pinged that's out in the open isn't it uh no it's got the compound yeah that's the compound one i think you're good if you went for that it is edge of zone so you know might be a bit hot a jack in there with the seven kills already me and start floundering around not even having a gun yet we tried to do the gun swap as well stop didn't we that failed uh well we just got instantly beamed a pretty unlucky round i gotta say get shot in the back by the default skin we didn't finish yep definitely a bronze five right bit of looting see if we can we need some yeah we need cash someone just respawned to the south as well uh don't know where we should go man yeah they're pushing around here jack on green so we're going to move on yeah maybe move out where's the next spy over here see if there's anything here is the hole in the hole is it going to be out soon or not sure uh no it's completely in all of it's in and we can still use this buy station is anyone camping atc that's a silly question in the whole ah it's been loaded i think i could do

go back and get the vehicle and then we can just escape well then these guys waiting at the top now of course there is he's got ideas at the beginning of circle three so yeah he might have just killed the guy that was trying to shoot him so you never know but he said we're going to be perfectly fine and everything's okay hopefully yeah oh you don't even need to cut that i'll go first got a pizza

nothing yeah the same oh oh you're too far away on the uav that's why i'm blue here yeah yeah they're on they're wrestling right now two residents just shut the door they've barricaded themselves in on blue yeah they've barricaded themselves in wait for the drops are they done they're behind i don't want the chance i'm glad with my left as well are you kidding me he just got absolutely toasted it's kind of like paintball isn't it look just splats on the wall whatever they've got they've got the buy station that's that's the annoying part here i have a team that's just to my left like coming from quarry splat on cameron it's like we're playing splatoon isn't it yeah where is he they added a paintball gun to modern warfare i mean yeah it did it looks like outside they just got killed by a different spot on the roof i can't see nothing i'm supposed to be sniping dude on this is insane yeah m13 is right 900 rounds per minute you still have to get headshots right yeah yeah it's it's got a lower body multiplier and a higher headshot multiplier the rose looks a bit crazy there running across the right but we can move now maybe moving on the wall to our right yeah rose is so beautiful i love her when's the rose only fans coming out that's why i wanna oh vehicle coming in on the right here guys i just got an assist on that team back there disabled it i need some assault life we got in here are we ready uh i'm gonna go get my ghost light out again i've got a fully loaded uh ar on it we are we're not in the greatest position i think because we're gonna have to run across the big open one of the loadouts just disappeared that king that king's gone enemy uav overhead do you reckon they're on that house they're still by the biceps yeah they are they are 100 whereas i saw a guy on this building as well by the way there's a guy only 100 go up the tower you ran across um are we ruined do we hmm we might be but it depends where the zone goes yeah he goes in towards us then we're fine and i got sniped from behind ah uh i don't think we can save your sd he's up on the hangout yeah i shouldn't have gone up there should i that's the king i think yeah yeah i see how i see my stem jack there to our north west and we'll just have to wait until they fight and we can't beat ever coward in the shack forever yes that's our job right now i did drop 210 assault rifle rounds up there you also dropped the specialist as well oh who's nick that there's one pushing down now we'll just wait for the zone and if it goes to them we'll just digest okay get the specialist quick oh yeah by the way this guy come from blue don't forget i don't know the guy coming from blue hundred percent it's really hard okay okay i mean they have a little better position jack have you got the tactical sprint still on i have also tactical sprint now yeah so you've got auto tactical sprint and specialist which means that you can literally beam around the map do i just run around like a zoomy who needs cars there's someone coming from blue areas good and jack's named him i knew he was coming dude i feel so i feel so fast right now man i'm like sonic there you you've snorted one back haven't you oh sniper top of the hill southwest south west out the hill oh i don't want to pick that unless you do stud well what do we do jack because we're now in the open go for the loadout there's cover on the loadout you go for that a little bit okay they're destroyed hill hill on the south west one in front jacket yeah they go nice we've got no cover at all here yep you've got this i hate this i hate this thanks i hate it prawn hide found him down here down him i'm blue i'm gonna throw in i think i'm just gonna all right i'm down the ground blue oh no it's north west now north west damn fight started we're okay yes i kind of like that oh it's still out now i got stuff from the other side i think they might be pushing up on the right yeah they're pushing up on the right pushing on the right but they're pushing us they're on the yeah they're getting an angle on you on the right hand side plus there's people on the buy station nice nice nice thank you you finished that's the last thing it seemed like there's two down then yeah there's one left behind behind that i need more i have no idea there's one more somewhere someone just rpg tv moving here 2v1 blue and blue blue no eyes he just shot me from blue with a rocket maybe he closer oh play hey nice oh we were up against it i like the zoomies though huh good it's good specialist plus tactical sprint oh man eg that's what it's like playing warzone with adderall ggs a fairly uneventful game though it's kind of cool not to see roses in a helicopter [Music] she's a good looking character yeah right i'll pull us out i think i forgot like how much of a beam the m13 is like it just has no recoil without it yeah it's great it's insane we're using commander or ranger commando yeah it's a beam absolute beam straight line yep all you gotta do is go for the um go for the headshots that's all you got to do that sounds like a good um thing to do in modern warfare only go for headshots over headshots i think especially with snipers especially especially snipers i think it's a one shot don't use the x50 ever don't worry about the bullfrog meme anymore studs oh you don't know you're done with it it's fine it's fine it's fun it's

the 10. rose is actually beautiful it's a good character model i like it i wonder if she's based off a real person or not because they do that with a lot of the modern warfare models hey luke thank you for the five very kindly man i appreciate the kind words thank you rose keeping that mask on it reminds me of tomb raider i'm sure there's an old school tomb raider game where that's basically the same costume right i can't believe that isn't a one-hit kill like a headshot from an mk2 isn't it isn't a one-hit kill i mean i get it because you can get a follow-up shot dead quick and your maneuverability is good but i don't know man like how many people are going to pick that in warsaw morales thank you for the five love your content jack how excited are you for battlefield six i am so excited for that game i am so hyped for the next battlefield game i feel like the fact that they've taken a year off you know they've had three years to make it i've got a feeling something special is

thermal [Applause] [Music] there's nobody about oh where the hell where are they gone they're just completely gone unless they're in the stairwell i can't see them i mean this that one but you'll be able to see them with the drone you see them through they f4 maybe no surely not enemies the car still there yeah the car's still there i've got no idea where they went boom oh there we go mark the target target right here so you got some space some time there's no buy stations here no you're gonna have to go you have to literally go to them we could just go promenade get the vehicle over here got a vehicle here oh yeah you could go promenade eco probably station from me they're gonna have their load i'll see yeah oh yeah this is open all over on the roof of a train stud over there heading out on the roof of train yeah okay i'm just gonna loot this even get some armor do i need plates i haven't i found one on someone's body but that's it it's like it's glitched or something anyway should we get to the bye uh yeah we can do get your best player back got me a cash stuff and i'll get it yeah yeah yeah okay here you go this is weird oh yeah [Applause] there's people over here fighting as well on the green okay did i just say that was it me no no no no i don't know just said something here in footsteps is uh oh they go full team coming in jack i think they've just come back from ghoulie oh ginger crate ended here on blue one of them's landing here you want to take this stud for the fight i've got no heights man uh there's my place there's my plate straight i got a munitions box i can bring over got the yeah sorry oh there's three there so let's get it that was really nice i accidentally pressed my uh lethal button and then hit the buy menu and it held the grenade until i was out at the buy me and then it just threw it i couldn't cancel it or anything another way to do this maybe that's how you duplicate the specialist hey jack john a couple players thank you i kind of just gotta wait for our loadout now yeah 45 seconds we probably yeah let's just try not to engage anybody until this loadout drops in respawn behind us as well yeah yeah disappeared so it was a slightly older one there's literally no plates where are the plates not a solitary plate was found this day a giant egg illegal a giant egg illegally illegally illegally elite not a single play dude what is this it's a glitch it must be it must be yeah and only by find a plate you have to let everyone know right loadout oh it's on the hill all right how many other people are gonna have their loadout over there one one other yeah i bet it's the guys from train station then we've already been looted in here as well dead rescue yeah we got no choice been back on brown and old vehicle to um on the car round our pants brown our pants that's probably them okay that's people on red on red roof this truck give me my m13 now and 13 beams unless there's someone behind us repositioning never mind might well be do you need munitions are you good uh it's too late i've thrown it do you want to get hotel repositioning yeah we could take green yeah there is people fighting on blue roughly yeah they're on red roof as well we can get there there was a rose skin on the red roof and not a new rose skin an old one oh there's the red mark there you go um where was it further back here on uh on yeah yeah [Music] i like a bit of danger me ah look only 55 players this time sweat lobby because we won the first game it was so boring and removed from my memory what was that a guy dropping in here do you hear those shots coming then jack they're dropping in on this roof there [Applause] yeah they shot me i don't know where they were oh they uh they've rest at the buy station straight east i jumped off the roof by accident i didn't mean to i don't see them cam i don't know where they yeah i think they tried to shoot me and i think they then ran away yeah they've rested up again that's a good name what's this rez right in front of us someone's just rest on blue guys relocating just took demons moving position mark the target am i doing the lady now yeah they're on their left oh god i've got to stop standing on the edge man it's not beaming every time i keep they're going to contact straight line yeah we're being hounded a bit here we might get pushed yeah we need to well we we're better off holding this position until the threat goes no plates either though ah oh yeah one that's right one there's 42 meters 42 meters southeast south east southeast they were down frankie yeah they're in car show room and they're on frankie and benny's taxi frankie's this is 35 meters car show room one right below me hey max just below the building on 200 yeah these guys probably got plenty should we drop off the backs we drop off the battery from the now so uh we need to get place we can buy some we can buy it yeah we just need to run up the hill i guess yeah keep moving we just gotta watch out for people coming from hospital as well we've just had no place since we got a lady yeah that's our only it's our only shout really we kind of need to get down the hill a little bit because you don't want to be stuck halfway up here with people running from hospital shots in front milano yeah just in front somewhere on there twins mark the target oh i should have waited longer oh yeah i think we have to we have to we need cover we're just gonna get beamed in the open with no plates what are we gonna do it's modern i've seen that like hannibal like to stitch skin a lot more recently i don't know why was it part of the battle pass was it was it the rank 100 there you go we've had double uh xk here you know some more people would have unlocked it [Music] but this has been an absolute povo round budget round yeah i got nothing 43 players left yeah no place 43 players left when was the last time you posted a two uh a double digit win in warzone i thought we're gonna get beamed here i don't know how how not a single plate not a single no not a single ground loop plate not even out of the um crates either no it's probably bugs i can buy a couple of sets we have to yeah and there might be too many plates in the lobby oh no gosh imagine that three sets i've gobbled three of mine already um it's again it's positioning zone let's go yeah we so iq up with randoms is what you're saying like kind of like what nick most does yeah that could be interesting i've not really done that before i did play some trios with random people on console which was quite fun that was ages ago [Music] two crates in here cheeky run through nope no plates no plates maybe it's just like no this is a no plates round yeah it's a little what order there's a limited time i'd live in some mode but you didn't pick it that's a good point actually it could be why the lobby start out so quick because it's just no place that is actually a very good point the only people who've got plates are people who've got money possible though because well let's let's ask uh answer that question with how many bugs can you think of in the game right now uh at least 10 off of dog what one of those bugs is the inclusion of the original sorry the gas mask animation is sorry intended sorry that's not a bug you found a plate jack yeah i found one and one the other one sniping from you might have yeah who's going moving his teammate didn't have um selfrest so he's have to run all the way [Applause] in the building moving position just peek blue in the corner target right here got it [Applause] how did we get two hits and no doubt there's one in this building as well he's got ghosts in your building jack the one that marks [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's no there's no one behind us have you got a little droney out there jack yeah got another one here double drone you get two drones no plates what did i mean george well there's a skin in the game i showed it at the start basically you can get rose without her mask on like this that's rose that's what she looks like i'm playing as her as well and cameron's playing it looks like tomb raider you killed one there yeah yeah yeah i'm green the guy that you spotted with the ghost oh that was a snipe that came in and zipped past me they just raised one train there's a crate uh someone just called in their loadout relocating did they did the [Music] [Applause] it looks like someone peeking in the door look come to this angle westy tell me it doesn't look like there's a bandit peeking the doorway from the bottom floor right there yes it does actually look like that what we're looking at jack i mean there's no one around at all uh i i'm not getting a doughnut round anymore there you go right here moving yeah i'm blue and blue on the fire station there's two in this town here just behind it where that three [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here yeah i'm green on green one in the window and green one's running across now i'm blue we just wanted to repair living train station the ax50 wesson ground yeah i am actually mad well you said the content didn't matter it doesn't i he's upstairs he's upstairs again he's upstairs he's on the right side he's on the right side behind that plaster wall upstairs oh i just got fired oh where from uh straight ahead get downstairs [Music] where was it from uh from the from the town southeast they have to come to us that town well they don't have a position anymore yeah yeah but from green they have to come together who sniped us though out here that's the guy from upstairs in dream building oh he's he's thinking he thinks we're active he's a jacket he's mel-min jesus i think he was the guy that sniped me i think he was the guy oh uh over here on cruise i can get shot from behind that's what i'm thinking well there is a squad because they got their load out there about five minutes ago someone shot from like over here somewhere they're moving there's definitely things like on green probably moving position there's definitely somebody on bank or there was somebody area is clear we're actually in a good spot here gas is inbound marking new safe zone well next zone is uh we've got some hill cover there's going to be a squad in there do we want to go really far we don't have ghosts yet guys we don't have guys okay yeah sorry let's go for loading then and then yeah this one yeah go around that way we don't have a lot of cover but i'll be alright one thing i thought about is one of the reasons why uh bunny hopping is so powerful in this game is if you look at the third person animation for money hopping it's mental but in first person it's nothing [Music] [Applause] by the way [Music] he's in the train he was peeking jack from he can hear peak in the left side blue 100 in about three seconds it's whose feet can't shoot them though how many plates we've got zero ruined uh i've got zero i can drop one if you want there you go thanks sir we're looking at we might have to be marketed yes this is a good cover here though if we want if you want to dip back yeah just pull back wait oh dude we could have gone to the bye the bath in the bath and the gas one here one already at the lodi watch out there's people shooting from green somewhere i don't know i'm running out of sniper ammo oh they're right next to me right next to me they pushed up two different angles here that's going to be a difficult one no no no no no no we're being shot from the different as well hey i gotta get it i have self-rest on orange oh you got a cover there that's good yeah that's not present orange by the way where is she still there with the lowly i'm here load he's out he's going to move [Music] he's going to probably hide no he's not going to hide he doesn't care yes he does keep the pressure off he does care he cares where's the loot or the guy we killed oh no nevermind i reckon there's still somebody in train you know um we haven't killed him there was one guy left from that squad it was a blue guillotine and he could one in the train in the train target right here and there's another there's two there's and i can't see him because i'm peeking and i can't see him guys pain boy yeah i'm not going to survive that nope nope 7 13. on uh back to work freezing cold hands this is not working properly i mean i literally can't beat i'm a hit what's the guy doing on orange can you not see him wesley no i can't see the guy on orange he's only peaking second on orange oh an orange again literally there head now i'm gonna hit again on the guy in the woods here in blue i'm moving don't know where oh yeah he's running he's running left five players left five players two other teams enemy mark what about orange orange mark is still there yeah orange is still there but he was you're okay here guys we've got no plates all right that's got him one two three one one left that was insane my hands are freezing i could not hit a single thing that game my hands are so cold oh you played well at the end now that's good we just had to hold the position because like we actually had an angle where nobody really could see us properly interesting yeah these are the games that we don't post on youtube but we we live streaming we live stream the budget and then we pick we cherry pick the best you've got some nice shots at the end there start with the old tundra well you don't you don't mess with us under you just shoot on them yeah on the target bang dead boom right i'm gonna queue us up i'm gonna go wash my hands in some lovely warm water to warm them up get a hand with my whiskey i need that yeah i should really the usb mouse mat that warms up is that the next big thing from corsair i don't know maybe don't you jack wow that was like a really weird game that one no plates barely any fights it's two in a row though not bad so someone wanted to see the m13 there it is i've got the acid tracer with it as well the new one commando 4 grip 60 round mag vlk tempest monolithic suppressor it's a beamer absolute beam what perks do i use eod overkill amped pretty much every game and then i get ghost in my second loadout instead of overkill because you don't need it anymore uh morales thank you for the five sandy what's up sandy you've been watching since 2013 love your work please keep it up you're so chill to watch thank you sandy it's very kind here glad you enjoy the content hunting fishing cod clips five dollars thank you sinclair thanks for the one two five roses based on

across any cheers last few days that we've played there was one day last week where we got three in a row but i think they're actually keeping their word and regularly banning people or at least updating their attitude i feel like they are because we're running to we're running into less and less cheeses it's been pretty good uh connor hey jack i'm looking to start streaming and i was interested to know what software you use for your streams um so i use obs open broadcaster software it's completely free it is the best and it does everything you want it to i'm not affiliated or sponsored with them in any way by the way it's just the best software and it's free no premium features or anything you don't have to pay a thing i've used it for years now and then i have a streaming pc which is connected to my gaming i use an pc capture card i use the 4k pro mark ii for capturing the gameplay then for my audio i use a go xlr and that's pretty much it you need a few cables connect it all up it's dead easy how many wins i don't know george i think it's we're coming up to 300 or something that's a chill cat thank you cheers luke good luck for this game we'll try and win it supply box mark all targets in the air anyone else land here uh there was a team that kind of went bank area maybe not sure yeah it might have gone further got a lad here just hanging around i found a plate

benny yeah i'm just going to chill in here i'm coming over to you they're pushing maybe i i'm outside now are they pushing from guys that was me shutting the door uh they were pushing the ball right from bank okay yeah one question now i've just seen him drop down he's just got down i might have anywhere there's a lot of people around down in the back there's one down just in front of the building guys yeah i got that one down on the bank as well yeah this got really hot all of a sudden i don't understand got a team wipe over here that's nice and then there's loads of people angry if you drop back to me it's clear over here the hell is going on there's people shooting from the roof yeah got two nasty snipes with the belly the guy here on me pushing down nice there's the guy on the [Applause] uh [Music] just have to leave that scab it doesn't matter yeah that's fine he's peeking from the right side of blue now guys i'm just getting up on the roof give me a sec i'll see if i can pelly him he's on big blue son yeah yeah he's done big blue he's just running around there yeah yeah actually i think we killed someone at the end about the clan tag mad another one moving in top of blue still two out there target right here right there can we go get a load up yeah okay no way i'm hearing that i'm where are we going well we've got one near stadium or one in sweatsville so um i'm running back now yeah we've got to go into downtown uh maybe take the truck just get the one here let's get ourselves away from there that's a break oh that they got down by someone else nice let's go yeah let's get out of here we're in the safe zone i can selfress potato oh my god dude okay yeah is that guy is that actually a guy is that a man no it's a tree but i think there was a guy on the field there's a guy on top above us nice let's take their position let's take that position i've got a peli can i get peli [Applause] truck coming in as well someone's just dropping on blue right now moving here get away from here this is messed there's someone who's just dropped on blue um higher buildings yeah dude it's getting beam man i don't know where that was from from the roof again i think yeah yeah i'm really refreshed what is it no he's here he's got m4 so he's got his load up he's trying to get to you guys i couldn't get is that his loadout jack i don't know i don't think so it was an m4 so yeah there's no one forcing ground lead is that the moment no welcome if you survive you earn your friends there's somebody at the top of uh just drilled me in the back [Music] the kilo's still really good um yeah the kilo is good i don't think it's mine while you wait feel free to give these wankers a proper durian and if you find something to throw feel free to give them that as well feel free to give them that as well entertainment that's good [Applause] thank you cod gameplay fight's ready you're up next mate get ready hey danny what's up daniel listen up soldier yeah kilo doesn't have the range [Applause] [Music] yeah you guys probably those ladies he knows um should we get in a bit like let's just go all the way back this is what you're gonna do can't play can't beat them with their lolis go all the way back go all the way around as long as you don't get spotted at all ever but hang on a minute zone's coming in yeah i know but we're still in the zone look one place our nearest buy is now yeah is there anything i know but what we have is death or you know run i'll run a 1980s horror movie [ __ ] game show death or run hulk king target right well i mean we could take the money we can't do anything with it but i mean jack's there surely he's inside the building okay right here on that's the guy that killed me by the way nice god are you good um i'm good i hate this tundra build we can hold that we can hold that king we can hide the king yeah we can hold him i want to hold him i want to cuddle him he's literally just bit behind these partitions up here is there a window you can see through this one i don't think so closing in lw3 i don't know like i think there's something when you're shooting down at people on this game sometimes it just doesn't work what's shooting down right yeah like someone who's like directly below you almost yeah maybe i'm just bad maybe it's because it's the smaller target to aim at you're aiming at the top of their heads as opposed to like a full body which is like a stick all right now we're just retracing our steps guys going back the way we came well we can we got to get to zone across now before we get too close to the big tower it's a death sentence either way so and we've got a heli on top of hospital oh no that's the spawn location for it i think i was just leading too much maybe yeah the lw3 is insane i don't know what the build is like on that thing though but on the ground one is awful 69 players left 69 dude nice nice over the hill or can i get myself res or my death [Applause] would you believe it there is no one who no one has used this by our hospital unbelievable scenes you want a uav by the way oh someone's just got their load out of the bike over here [Applause] what res do i play 1440p really good res for war zone see things a lot clearer in the distance like when in the twitch tournament they just did a jailbreak every round they didn't tell anyone but they were playing for money well they forced it yeah yeah every round huh i think that i think there's gonna be one guy coming back in for his gear stop there's like killed one just before head now cancel that just check let's just go on the loadout oh there's time what's happening bend him through the wall [Applause] is there another one yeah there's two of them down here come on why can't i head him through that i can pin him through the back wall but not the side wall brilliant basically it just became my prey we've got people on twitter uh yeah there's gonna be like we could keep the guys at hospital moving here there's a guy here hello that's an easy kill probably yeah that is a super easy kill he's going to come over the hill come on jack get him we're back in here drop him henry yeah lasered and it hello broke his armor in there why is that heavy lagging so bad is it looking for you guys as well yeah it's seriously laggy still got someone up on twins my station i disregard that can we get an angle i don't see anybody up there but yeah that heli is lagging really hard if you land a shot on that it is taking damage [Applause] fully stopping on my screen i'm just lagging as hell it's just going hurt all right we're good all done oh duh anything any airstrikes something like a thousand meters away does that work give it a go jet i need a target first [Music] got gas inbound safe zone relocated let's move up go to the compound up here i forget how much i like the ax50 for its movement speed that's the only thing i like about it is it quicker than the hdr in terms of movement speed yeah yeah but it's just not got the bullet velocity i think it's only just over a thousand meters per second bullet velocity i think it's a little fast i think it's one 100 i think i remember oh vehicle vehicle vehicle he's gone he's eaten away he's heated away he didn't want it supply box location he's coming back ish he's on the end they're making love they've both jumped out of their vehicles they're fighting for some reason we can't hit the shots one two tech rovers love each other very much one of them is just blown up i don't wait we didn't hear any of the shots so everyone's suppressed i guess they're gone yeah i guess so they've eaten i said just switched vehicle yeah maybe well maybe the two of them came together and made they made a truck made a truck maybe a bubby well there's no atv there's no bodies no do you want to take the white do you want to take this white building here or this one head out that one's nice a nice a nice green ping boy i love it yeah i love it i would like to use the airstrike i have airstrike also nothing on heart be good uh this is a shot over here guys close ground level on orange yeah watching truck on yeah the furthest hangar oh yeah see it moving i'm broke yeah i'm a broke he's he's one shot down yeah oh sniper here on the train on the train and there's one actually in front of that one here on the rock head now enemy uav overhead yeah they're still on the track over there got an enemy a young man i climb this without dying um sure you can do anything if you play you can do it if you really want a kill for an orange stud hang on you can meme them if you really want i'm moving a bit more we're kind of a bit isolated over here i need some sniper armor if you got it there you go i got me i got munitions target right here i think there's someone in acc probably you yeah i'm coming back over i'm in the hangar target right here oh that's clear that one striking it's good [Applause] yeah yeah and it wasn't those guys i'm pretty sure they could have run from there right well maybe yeah that guy might be coming over from twins as well you if i can get the guy on atc you leaving him cam no i'm i'm not going to go that far out it'd be uh if i get caught out in the open there it'd be silly all right right here atc stuff i'm seeing hopefully there's no one here you can't get him i'm in maybe a bit too high but i can't fill it oh that was close oh damned one nice one it's broken oh my god you killed brookie i wonder if i get anything you get it oh sniper red roof [Music] this side is completely clear now there's no one else moving here i have no plates i will buy some plates red roof on the green ping yeah the red they're holding us on red ruth they're green here yeah rose skin now no yeah yeah this is a bad roof really isn't anything about it take place awesome oh okay i'm just gonna run right felicia police isn't bad but they can still see you from red yeah it's not ideal but it'll do for now i need to pick up some plates anyway i mean we could just take this large building here large the long building let's buy some plates there's a respawn coming in as well north don't see him i'm blue kidding loads of gear around here [Applause] playing with fire why is that sniper looking at me they're just peeking us now i wish let's find out where it's going to go can we get across there i don't know still got munitions for later on positioning zone then hit the rose skin drop head in your way do we have ghosts already i think i do there's three loaders pushing back oh no no no no they're gonna finish me no come on unfortunately i heard their footsteps is it just one guy cam oh it's three it's three yeah and they've all recovered damn it dude [Music] [Music] you want to move uh yeah i guess they go left yeah we have to unfortunately those guys are probably still in that building on red they may have uh uh i don't know [Applause] really yeah they have to move though i don't think i can get to you without being shot though jax the problem he's pushing me on this side okay [Applause] where's the gun dude i'm just sitting there on the wall oh that's annoying they could be on the wall in the corner you see um i'll mark it they could be right here unless you find one bit of money or you take the truck and just drive around get a king grab a king get a truck yeah you see one there is a beam that that was one of the guys uh mm-hmm yeah rose skin left i've gotta move though he's gonna get he's gonna go along the wall he's gonna go along the wall towards you probably as in the one closer to you [Applause] he was above you yeah but he had he must have had daddy when he would jump in because i didn't hear any of this love this next though i didn't have a gas mask though like if i had a gas mask i would have some options there i think yeah because you could have run around the outside damn it we go again well they're just chilling in fire station then the whole time they chilled in fire station sniped you so i knew if i ran over the road i'd probably get sniped and then they pushed over the airfield that was called the helicopter pad and uh we had one in the back one in the front oh this is this is interesting um jim's hairdressers and non-essential shops could reopen by 21st of april with all limits on social contact lifted by the 21st of june under the pm's plan to lift lockdown in england so we can hug each other on the 22nd of june coughing is now legal again nothing is illegal oh god you may now cough on your children only only if they wear a mask how

purpose because there's no point because i would just waste them because i'm likely to get downed again easily by a sniper so what's the point in me using my plates and then just getting down again and wasting them i'll use my plates when we're about to move again it's just being resourceful that's all hello they're telling me we don't know they're fighting somebody down here on green on that

did you guys have three i don't know i can't remember we got three atc life take us take a sniper and you're fine there's lots of damage that round we should have moved one circle earlier i think yeah because we were right on the edge of that circle yeah that's funny okay let me have a look at some of these plans yeah they will reopen from the 12th of april if if strict conditions are met what's going to be open gyms and shops hairdressers gyms and outdoor hospitality i just got disconnected that's weird okay um uh up to six people from separate households could be able to meet in beer gardens from that date right um uh uh said the plan aimed to be cautious but irreversible basically saying they don't want to do another lockdown again but i don't know what he said he said there's uh no credible route to a zero covered britain or a zero covered world basically we live with this forever i mean 12th of april though like that's still that's a whole month in almost two weeks like it's still a good six weeks away yeah so from the 8th of march all schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed um recreation in outdoor public spaces such as parks will be allowed between two people outdoor gather and then from the 29th of march outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed yeah i did is that is right isn't it when if you've got daddy and you get a kill it gets replenished i think that's great i want editing software craig are you sony vegas hey fatty cakes what's up i'm good thank you how are you yeah i feel like in a lot of those circumstances if i had a galil like the amac sorry i'd uh i'd be getting kills but the m13 does a lot of armor breaks at longer distance it's not great medium range is very good though uh lobster city thank you for the five i don't even play warzone but your streams keep me company during my thesis thank you man i hope your thesis goes well uh deteriorates the chosen thing for the 10.
