apex legends it's really been a while hasn't it last time i posted a video on this game was november 2020. you know like when they bought the new map out and the new horizon character but i only played it for a couple hours to be honest with you that was it but myself and acolyte decided to hop on and see what the game was like right now and we had a ton of fun here now since i played they added a new hero called fuse a couple of new weapons attachments and gadgets that you can use in the game and we just had a blast here finding the game again exploring and surprisingly it was really good fun and it certainly made a nice change of pace from warzone with that said i hope you guys enjoyed this i've got two great games here to show you acolyte just couldn't stop crashing and that led to all sorts of hilarity if you liked the video do hit that like button below thank you it's a great way to help support me and a comment down below as well and subscribe if you want to see more and let's get into the action now let's see what happened i'll try this new guy then if you want yeah can you contract your bloody life he's bloody australian isn't he corner oh yeah mike oh yeah champion squad zero kills that's very threatening uh i think i see another set of shadows oh man they're in a fight already dude already yeah they're fine over here okay i'm gonna try to find armor first this guy doesn't have any uh defensive abilities at all no yeah that you're kind of like a ranged utility character okay okay just try to shoot at me that's rude maybe there he is with a shield ow dude i just got ruined by that guy recharging the shield nice can i get my cue over there it was top level oh you shot that so far did you damage no they put the shield up are we going for this kind of if you want yeah here nice i think they went down underneath okay i got one down that's it well done this is definitely one of those games where like if you put somebody on their back foot you want to push yeah oh air battle what's going on here that was awesome he's got a gold carbine only an apex you want to take that yeah sure that was like the last second i heard those footsteps at least you can hear them in this game yeah stone and i were talking about that the other day like you when you hear a footstep you hear it it's far yeah that's good there's no sneaking up on people in this game no dead silence no stopping power if you crouch from memory you don't make that much noise right like so you can be a bit stealthy if you want to right yeah this is it is a lot more quiet but you do move very slow right yeah although um what's his face the guy the robot guy he has a passive that lets you like crouch really fast um pathfinder does he no no uh the evil evil robot guy evil robot guy doctor robotnik i don't know what you're talking about actually um revenant oh revenant yes okay i could feel you forgot about it evil robot i mean i was close with it right no yeah it's just pathfinder but evil exactly yeah it's great i never even play music when i'm streaming this game there's no point are you crafting i am bag uh i don't have enough only 50. oh my god let me grab this i'm gonna make myself a bag there we go now i can make a you can bag around to the other one while that one's crafting yeah you can craft multiple i need some ammo what's the fall clan then what does that mean oh this is for stone oh right because he yeah we made this a while back and unfortunately whoever's the leader can do like public messages so it just pops up on your main screen before you even get to play yeah we made the mistake of making stone the leader unfortunately what's this um ouch time ouch time yeah look at that big that big billboard there oh it's like rock'em stock robots yeah what the hell you guys ever had that yeah no we did i mean i i was never allowed to have it as a child because it was considered too violent kind of what enemies of the state i absolutely need oh my goodness which one's real the one that fired at us oh should we chase this guy oh he's here khan that's fake oh i'm so confused yeah the so they changed his uh the way his ultimate works don't take this gun i broke that guy what do you need a light ammo oh i don't have any of that unfortunately oh they're going oh they're fighting another squad oh let's go capitalize on that then well i kind of loot this guy you said you need light right yeah maybe maybe sneak it oh just i just love the grenade up there uh how effective is my ultimate i've got no idea it's pretty you can pull it out when you when you press your button you don't have to actually use it i just go boom yeah and it does like a ring of fire i could launch this up if you want i thought i don't have enough ammo really i've only got like 20 bullets in each gun this guy had heavy if you want to swap to a heavy weapon oh you said he's speaking he's speaking uh yeah oh no there it is ow dude what the hell was that if i put my alt on them they're gonna have to move aren't they behind us as well uh maybe we should probably move away from here i'm thinking or get like directly underneath them what do you think let's get underneath them at least this way they can't attack us of course you're charging my shields you just ping me on sonar again yeah he's not going to jump down though they got a good good height advantage there oh ripley it's your right as well um i don't know how we're live but we're live i just went up so i can kill this guy up here there we go good jump there's another guy here oh no i'm gonna die kind of place oh man that was bad timing i'm coming up he is low though the armor swapped there's a guy behind me as well i'm gonna try to go back down all right i'm down yes oh i didn't know that guy was still that guy was actually up there i don't have any shield bats um here you want some heels no i'm okay i oh i can't drop stuff for you i've got medical hills hold on i've got i've got 20 bullets left there you go oh my god do you want my sniper i can give you the triple take it's okay thank you for the memes one minute well we could loot that other guy right where did we kill that one guy i don't know where he went like he i feel like he should be here somewhere oh oh sonar detected that was from our left oh no i hate this corner we could go up and fight that guy if you want i think there was only one okay yeah here here did you make it just never mind i lied there's two ones almost knocked he jumped off okay that's me completely out of ammo i need to switch gun uh loot that guy dude he hasn't got any ammo he's literally got no mama you've got to be kidding me he's got an ark star though there's a team oh no he's so low i can all one of the best writers do you actually have no ammo jack oh god i've fallen down yeah i've got zero ammo you want me here i'll drop you my sniper check it out there's a guy right here nice okay okay okay ammo out he's got 420 yes you're good then and now i'm dead no no you're fine you're fine you guys miss too much what is this game okay it's fine everything's fine everything's fine [Music] i really feel like we could take
