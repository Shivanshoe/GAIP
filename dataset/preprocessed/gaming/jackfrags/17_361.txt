got a lot of teammates here can i get the third still that one i can hear someone charging what's he doing okay there's so many footsteps uh you know what i'm just gonna go goodbye i love this outdoor area that's where the megadome comes out doesn't make any sense but i love it shotgun 50 damage as well that could have killed me there's a dude right here this way johnny quit he was about to bare at me would have annoyed me i don't know if you guys care about this but i went to see uh some of my family today it was just nice you know in the uk now we're allowed to meet people outdoors i nearly died then so i went to see my uh my mama my nan which was cool i want to see my dad and his wife and also a mate but uh it was just it was just nice you know because i've seen him in ages what are you doing here ah my nan is brutally honest though right as soon as uh as soon as she saw me the first thing she said was you put on weight my man just dissed me thank you for the rest just diss me man i love it just brutally honest i was like well yeah you know i've been uh i've been sat indoors during lockdown working away eating a lot that's true occasionally going on walks but for the most part yeah i'll definitely put on weight oh man i was going right not that much a little bit i just think it's funny how my man just slayed me as soon as as soon as she saw me she's moving out soon so she's been up in the attic in the loft and she's got all of me and my brother's old toys up there and she was like do you want any of these and she brought down a box of mighty max you guys remember that did you have that i don't know if you had that in the u.s it's like polly pocket for boys i guess is a way of describing it but little uh like creatures that opened up and they had uh like playsets inside them but they were tiny they were awesome man i just love playing that stuff when i was young still kind of do something else have i got the flank i messed up oh my god that's too many right i'm falling back yeah my max was awesome you must have had it in the u.s surely i don't know about europe or rest of the world it was massive in the uk they had a show about it as well it's cool to you know see some of that stuff from i don't know like 25 years ago that i just completely forgot about that guy's got a shotgun he didn't want to peek again though i've got the how council you not die there's one right here on the radar look like i go first there sell them as the bait no don't dude i want to go out thanks oh no this is where i died last time in it not a good flying cat all right you coming in not grenades i'm going how's the enemy oh okay it's been a really good round actually like i've just been waffling really saying whatever's on my mind but we managed to take all the sectors so far there's so many people on either look at the map this gun's awesome though after that i'm not sure they should have given this to the medics there's one two three four oh beautiful see what i mean four cut down in my prime killed by an auto loading to be fair that was one of my favorite guns in the game we got the win now here gg that guy just hanging out [Music] with ours how
