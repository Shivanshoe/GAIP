hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty modern warfare season 2 went live yesterday and I put together a vaad which covered all of the new stuff a couple of new maps a couple of new guns and lots of new cosmetics and just that good stuff but today we are doing some live gameplay commentary this is live right now and I can see you guys in the chat so hello I hope you're doing well if you've got any questions or want to bring up a discussion of some sorts then please feel free to do so and if you're watching this as a vaad after the fact thank you I hope that we could get some good games for you so I thought maybe we should start with some rust today seeing as that's it's a classic fan favorite map is near 1v1 me on rust bro so we might jump into rust for a bit of a warm up I'd like to get a few more games on the new ground war map because I barely played that yesterday cuz it's a bit difficult sometimes to get the map that you want especially when it's a new ground war game but I really want to try that out and maybe we'll do some snipers only because I've not played that yet but if we look at the Battle Pass I did unlock some of the tiers I've not actually got ghosts yet Simon Reilly where is these appear somewhere I don't think I've been locked it yet but I need to look how cool is this dude it looks a bit different how he looks in modern warfare though in the original you stick now Oh Deary me but yeah I need to I need to unlock that bad boy there's a ton of like new cosmetics and stuff I just I haven't gone through it all because yesterday this dropped 6 p.m. UK time which is getting pretty late in the evening for me I've worked throughout the day and the patch was 68 gig 68 gig I don't have like really fast internet like it's ok I get if I'm downloading from like blizzard I get 8 or 9 mb/s so it's not bad and you know that used to be considered fast but where I live it's the fastest that I can get without buying like a dedicated gigabit internet line so I get like eight and nine mb/s download and it took me wow how long did it take me maybe an hour and a half to two hours to download it apparently you guys are saying if I bought the battle Basha sure I've ghost already all right I didn't realize that so he should be in here somewhere Arius well thank you I'm an idiot I didn't realize that so it took me ages to download the areas it took me ages to download the patch and then by that point I had to like record all the gameplay and then you know get get games on rust on boneyard the IKEA map as I like to call it I think it's called like Atlas superstore something like that reminds me of the the tarkov level you know I mean well he does actually have a yeah that's cool so then I spent ages editing that video and uploading it and I actually released that video yesterday at 2:00 a.m. UK time but uh it did really well because it's a it's about battle rail right I don't know if you guys saw but in the cinematic intro for season two I don't know if I can play it again is there a way for me to play that again I couldn't figure it out but when you load up the game for the first time it plays like a new intro cinematic and it's it's basically I mean it almost 99.9% confirms battle royale because the guy goes we need to exfil the gas is moving in and then it zooms out and there's tanks and the squad's fighting there's explosions and then there's people dropping out of a plane at the end so come on you might as well come out with it now Infinity Ward you might as well say it it's gotta be it's gotta be battle rail but anyways I'm sure we'll be discussing that during the the video today in the stream so we're gonna queue in for some rust warm up a bit and then see if we can get the ground war map on the girl got some double xp so cancer oh yeah but going back to my internet connection in the UK if you live outside of London it's really difficult to get a good internet connection without paying an arm and a leg for it so actually inquired about this and there's a couple of few different companies that you can use the way that they do it in the UK this one company has a monopoly on everything really and they charge you based on how far your property is away from the exchange and because of where I live it's a bit like far out we're gonna ask for five thousand pound to install it and then it would be nine hundred pound a month for gigabit internet so gig down Giga I was just like now there's no I don't want to pay nine hundred pound a month thank you yeah Maura spin oh that stalling thing I mean that's that might be the the saving grace for me I don't know I kind of wish I was from sweet do you guys have mad internet why is the resolution like lower than usual it's weird all three I want to be full screen it's gonna go black for one second yet nine hundred pound a month guys can you believe that like who's gonna pay that as ridiculous why would you pay that no way and I have friends who who living in Sweden and Norway and they're like oh yeah we get gigabit internet a standard in our apartment it comes it's included in the rental cost are you kidding me dude are you actually living there insane enthuse just camping out for some reason I've got a whole trade yes on which I don't like I need to change that in a second yeah Sakai doing it's insane like the whole infrastructure of the Internet in the UK is it's just crazy guys absolutely crazy where is I'm gonna slide behavior toggle I love all the customization in this game it's great I think we're just gonna get dumped on this game all right that feels that way behind me breasts elution yeah the wages are high but the cost of living is even higher right don't make sure Sweden and Norway they get like crazy taxes don't they but they have like a great quality of life so you know does it bounce it out no maybe I suppose it depends on your living situation huh $80 for one gig down an ER doc Foxy's serious $80 for one gig down enough that is insane what John Darrow said UK in Germany of 15 years behind us Internet infrastructure SIM cards larger screaming well SIM card I'm glad you're him and thank you for coming a subsample gun customization is my favorite part I could spend a lot of time in the gunsmithing we only have three players everyone just left the game kinda intrigued uninfected ground war might be here on this also though I wouldn't pay that yeah Taylor in fact your ground was gonna be quite fun I think I wanna I just want to see if I can get that new map I barely played it yesterday I've got like two clips for the video and then that was it what's up zhutka from poland how you doing hello Magic Johnson yeet CID brine Golding Jack marry me or if you've got a good proposal maybe Alex MacLeod $70 for Google Fiber in the USA you're lucky man you are so lucky what's the perp at Jack hey Chris hey Holly Henry Lee Richardson what's a Parker Madden are you doing guys thank you for coming along I appreciate you know listen this is a serious problem Modern Warfare please when you bring out a new ground war map just have a playlist for that map come on it's about time John Darrow says Jack are you going to make a video out of this yes so this will just go up as a video afterwards when this when the stream is finished in a couple hours it

you doing moist rebound what's up Michael alo I don't think we're gonna get it guys hello Dijon greetings from Serbia Wow I should filter that really shouldn't I the new one the new IKEA map is on it's got a few different game modes doesn't it Jochen [ __ ] kill confirms on it don't really want to play infected headquarters is pretty cool I will go with that Cora Adam sonic thank you for becoming a member man there's a lot of people in here today guys a face graphics what's a barrel rex welcome guys I hope you're all having a great day have you seen a glimpse of the battle rail map well I've seen something on reddit which mmm they have been real I don't know if it was doc Fox thank you for becoming a new member I've seen like a day so mind image but I don't know if it's real or not I've not seen 19:17 yet Republic Commando I need to watch it for dansk man we just knock it I'm just gonna quit play whatever we're not gonna get the new ground warmup hey Dario case of fear what's up lieutenant pancake yeah I really want to watch 1917 I want to watch parasite what else there was a cut there was another couple of movies I went to see birds of prey a couple days ago there's a couple of others like I saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that was really good although it does go a bit crazy at the end it was a movie that I watched actually called ready or not which was like absolutely crazy it was quite fun I thought it was gonna be terrible but it was alright what is 1917 it's a it's a movie by Sam Mendes about World War one it's basically battlefield one the movie as far as I can tell from the trailer like it looks amazing apparently the whole thing is made to look like it's one continuous shot which is obviously that's a bit insane right so I really need to go and see that I recently finished watching The Watchmen TV series to like that was really cool I wasn't sure how good that was gonna be but it's really good you would get an aid from here to that just missed a few trench runners are given a mission yeah I've got to watch it most movie slow in the UK come out a bit later than the US like we tend to get movies a bit later I don't know why I think it's something to do with the movie studios but I have a lot of friends in the US and they're like hey you need to see this movie on lights not out for another month so guess I'll guess I'll just have to wait socks here thank you the - yeah Jojo rabbit as well I've heard that's pretty funny honey to watch that location secure a glitch here so this is one of the new guns this is the growl we call it growl or how would you how would you say it case oh come on and I mean there been three seconds you're gonna walk into that but you actually get tagged without named now killer you still in there it's how to trade kill I know someone at the back with a sniper you know that sniper still there don't know maybe he's the old tactical sprint get out of the way I reckon that sniper might still be in there yeah I should have known I should have known broken border Jack how often do you hang out with tag outside a video um every now and again so me and the tag Tommy and Adam they're the guys that I play with a lot we've actually known each other since we were 15 16 so we've been friends for 18 years really and the reason that we met each other was because of counter-strike that's it well kind of cut a bit of counter-strike and a bit over the stick I told this story I don't know if I've told this story before I went to the school where there was a there was a sixth form like college so when you like you know seventeen and eighteen and new new people would join the school and there was a new girl that joined from a different school and we started dating she was friends with a girl who knew Tommy Adam so we we basically went to the cinema to watch the Matrix Reloaded together you know the first time we'd met each other and we just got talking we just like do you play video games yeah what do you play counter-strike oh we play counter-strike and then we just started playing counter-strike together that was it that's how we made sure I missed a sniper second hello my fov is too too low maybe I'm just a too close Jack if you like Joe Joe rabbit watch iron sky okay oh isn't that the one about like World War two isn't it really weird hasn't it got Hitler riding the dinosaurs sure it does like it's it's just for office system deployed some of the voices in this game down out of ten sure my stem on what's my favorite mode to play in this game gunfight I think I would I would play a lot more ground war if the killstreaks weren't in or if it just had passive killstreaks this ground war can get really really blinding with the kill streaks by the vehicles are so good at walling and not easiest to counter either I think maybe it needs to be balanced a little bit ground war cuz it like it could be just way more enjoyable I think with a few different tweaks but yeah that's just my opinion enemy at the barbershop he's just trying to get a haircut isn't he leave the guy alone how that sniper was in there if I put an S I'm going to try this I don't know if that guy he's actually gonna be killed by this book there you go don't camp in the same building or the wells on position airstrike on it oh oh that is a dirty position right there oh it's horrible all I want to do is play IKEA dude grenaded yeah cuz I'm scared let's go Wow a unit gunfire gunfire the most enjoyable games a gerb new perk for pistols akimbo yeah saw that I was watching you know do you guys know Noah J on YouTube he does a lot of streams on YouTube he plays a lot of Call of Duty as well a lot um B's I was watching him yesterday and you can have a Kimbo in this game now he was just running around with like jewel deagles in jaw three five seven they look sick I don't know how you unlock it though I think it's a perk is that right is there a part for the guns if so I need to get it just cuz it looks ridiculous right like a Kimbo sewed up it's so cool who killed you that's dirty angle Josh do you think this is the battlefield 5 there oh um not really I mean like there are some similarities I think especially with ground war burp I this is Call of Duty isn't it's just very different battlefield Jay King oh he's up there again with that sniper right the time to killing this is like insanely fast I was obviously battlefield 5 when it came out the time to kill was insanely fast but they've just like flip-flopped on it so much and nothing it's good my god I'm much preferred playing battlefield 5 when the time to kill was faster oh I want one the time to kill him battlefield will be as fast as it is in this game it's just insanely fast in this game and I don't look that would suit battlefield because the maps are so big right I got the last kill look how bad this one set out 10 and obviously like battlefield has a lot of destruction and it has more vehicles vehicles in this are quite basic they're fun to use but they're still quite basic aren't they so no I don't think so I think I definitely think a lot of people who left bow fill five are probably playing this game though because I reckon a lot of battlefield players want a modern-day battlefield again and this definitely ticks some of those boxes right you'd be IKEA come on give me IKEA IKEA then also there's not there's not much team play is therein unless you talk in gunfight or SMD like team play doesn't really come into Call of Duty in my opinion whereas I think there's a lot of team playing battlefield not so much in bf5 but in games like be a three bf4 bf - yeah definitely what's up D belt how you doing what do you think of the new design for ghost it's cool man it's just thick is nice wall who's been here in the gym look at him he's a big lad oh no no no no no please new map I'm begging you and endless Lamar said what's your favorite movie I don't have a favorite movie I have lots of movies that I like but I don't think I could pick one could you pick one there's a lot of movies that I like to watch over and over again I just never get bored of like the matrix like I've I think I've seen the matrix about 20 times and it's always good I really liked some of the school say Z movies you know like shutter island' The Departed oh it's the beta map god no don't want it I like some of the eighties horror movies like the thing it's a great movie credits are kind of relevant isn't it Saving Private Ryan I think is one of my favorite movies what's up Brian P thank you for the $5 I like a lot of Tarantino movies I love the Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan I think that's just like I've watched that trilogy so many times the aliens movies it's just too many to think of guys but I couldn't I don't think I could pick one movie there's like and it like Leon the professional I don't know if you guys have I've seen that but it's a a movie that came out in 1993 I think made by Luke based on very good film notice it's got Natalie Portman in it I think she was only like 30 or something that's one of my favorite movies I've really not put any attachments on that I'm not a big fan of this map and they found the predatory stirring in bathroom Pfizer no they haven't Willem thank you for the 26 dude you are the MLG MVP well I don't know about that but thank you yeah it's got Gary Oldman in it as well Leon the professional he's brilliant in that movie I like I mean I love the Star Wars movies some of them honest good but you know I grew up watching those movies when I was a little kid like I did me so this is the other new gun here a striker it's called it's classed as a long-range SMG also they say and you do feel the damage at range you can feel the drop off semtex that was a nice grenade we're gonna watch this button right down the stairs ah cheeky double kill of course you went she did yeah feel like I need to increase my FOP a bit how long have I been doing YouTube Parker I've been doing YouTube since October 2011 so what's that eight years and five months eight years and five minutes I've been doing it this gun you know what today is actually a special day as well not really I mean it's just a bit minute it's a bit of a milestone for me a bit of an achievement and it was one of my long-term goals when I start making YouTube videos we actually hit 1 billion views today which I'm I'm stoked about man I never thought I could do that but everybody just holding here if you go on my YouTube channel and go to the About section you can see how many total views we've got and today I actually hit 1 billion crazy like 1 billion is 100 million isn't it place it's insane insane amount it's just a little goal that I had when I started making videos you know that's all you don't get anything for it but I'm glad that I made it and I'm really thankful that you guys are here you know still watching my content even after eight years I appreciate you man feel like I'm gonna dine here on the Left Oh what did it unbelievable I was a thousand million is it I'm bad at math obviously you can tell hang on isn't the definition of a billion different there's like two different definitions of it right am I just going crazy bear in mind that we've already established that I am indeed bad at maths oh you see that there that's where the SMG range just really kills you horrible you miss my super chair hold on I'm trying to concentrate on the game great boss gaming said thank you love your work grey boss thank you very much but tears didn't see what you said sorry you care an American a difference yeah I thought so a chopper pup G has a TDM mode what since when like is that brand-new I know they have it in put G light I didn't realize that it was in the main game I nearly got the third yeah get good moving down use that cover well SMG please that needed oh come on with these shotguns dude that's stupid 75 Mon just the lease absolutely delete you Jack what are you thoughts on the new Rus hey it's cool like it's it's just as chaotic and crazy as it used to be come on we're good we clear we play it's it's Russ isn't it it's the same it feels the same to me it just looks nice it's got a new got a new liquor paint as they say pretty sure the UK was using the term 1 million million back in the 70s in that bit stupid you might as well come up with something new right now we're gonna go with 1 million million it's a really bad spot totally have access up there I want to get up there how thick you BISM tell me you want to play more hell let loose oh definitely yeah a lot loose is really fun well beside hey guys if you're not in George squad can you leave the church please thank you very much for your donation woah it's very kind here hey guys if you're Martin George squad can you leave the church please you'll only understand that reference if you saw my last cell let loose video and we'll leave it at out for now oh actually here that was lucky I mean it's gonna be grenade central I was very lucky that RPG she playful scripta okay and they'd work it's guy with the shotgun how quick was that watch this the lid did we not get that ah die die die grenade it's not gonna go in come on just get the damn HQ please silence there's always enemy at the scaffolding let's be real bro the reason that I prefer hell let loose to polish Krypton is because you have markers over your friendly teammates and you don't get team kills all the time I've tried to play post scriptum in the past and just got team killed so much and I was just like you know this is just it's not fun and I know it's supposed to be a realistic shooter but I kind of prefer it when I can see my teammates and I don't have to identify the in uniform it doesn't break my immersion or anything you know it just like makes me less frustrating I guess because I'm not getting team filled all the time I will give it another go though but I think like the sound in post scriptum is really good he'll let loose definitely needs better audio but I think in terms of overall graphics and level design and gunplay he'll let loose how's it for me and like I said the fact that you can see teammates is that's that makes the whole experience better I think right okay 78 attempt at getting the new ground warm up let's go let's go I'm sore have you ever watched the series Band of Brothers yeah her bangs are brilliant it's one of the best TV series ever a watched in ivory watched it like two years ago I need to watch the Pacific guide I only got like a couple of episodes into that and then I kind of got bored of it but maybe I was too young so if I BRE watch it now it could be alright our super chat question was in the new intro of copy odd is clearly a chopper flying do you think they'll be pliable or do you think of the kill strip base oh well I mean if there is the call of duty Battle Royale yeah I think you'll you'll definitely be able to fly the helicopters like if you think about remember blackout blackout had helicopters that you could fly if you up c4 on that he was going for the old c4 Jeep listening Wow okay they're all over that I you know if they have helicopters in modern warfare battle royale if it's real then yeah you'll be able to fly them surely right probably ah come on I bet choppers will be nothing but transport only said doc Fox Pacific is nowhere near as good Kalama are you gonna make a video going over the info from projects a I am really interested in project a I kind of want to play the game first though before I you know do any videos on it [Applause] well I've gotta tag then but no one here yeah I'd love to play project say it's definitely gonna be a game that I cover too because it's supposed to be like counter-strike gunplay and like I love count dissipate so yeah I think it might be good I know that a couple of people got to play it recently and they've been like tweeting about it they can't like I can't say everything like I think they've limited exactly what they can say but most people that played it have said that it's like really good like the the best thing the best thing since counter-strike oh come on the kill streak was ended but yeah I need to I need to play it I can't wait actually you know if I can get some capture of it soon it'll be really good and it's definitely gonna be a game guide cover as I love competitive shooters actually started playing counter-strike a lot again like off op stream off YouTube with my friends and really enjoying it I think CS is one of those games that you can just all you just always go back to and have fun and I don't think any game yet has like refined the formula of competitive shooters as good as counter-strike house maybe project they will be the one a [Applause] project a sounds like a very generic game says unit seven one three a generic name yeah I think project a is probably a temporary like a codename or something I don't think that they're actually going to call it that look at that Esther I can I think I did I'm sure they'll give it a proper name when it comes out and what that will be I've got no idea because if that was a little rude there through oh wow okay the cruise missile didn't get me for once usually on the one with the big target painted on my head and it just says aim here if you want to kill Jack yeah oh man those proximity mines a Johan watch out for the prim pubs and dribble schnapps I've got no idea what that means but I'll watch out for them thanks for the two books let's try in the back then maybe I like the rest of cab they give me fun project a is just a placeholder it confirm that there I mean yeah it's not not very exciting name for a game is it your boys do you want to come and play project a with me yeah I wonder what they call it it's like counter-strike but with abilities I don't know but like there's a guy that I know called Henry G and he was he got to play it he said that the abilities like they kind of just support you rather than like get kills for you which are kind of like you know if it's a competitive game I'm more I'm much more interested in the skill of going playing the movement rather than what character you've picked I hear someone talk it hits me [Music] yeah it's on my radar looking forward to it I've already done a video on actually [Music] the video was just me kind of like going over the basic info that they released because they they did talk about it a bit but they only released a few snippets like oh it was a few gameplay Clips that was it [Music] come on drop down are you there why did I come out there yes seal a moist rebound have a good night David yeah I like the way he looks any more news on ready or not Jax no I don't think so I know that ready or not the game has that was a great sport isn't it thank you ready or not has like alpha tests but they're under embargo like you can I can't talk about it or record it or anything one that got away what the bloody hell was that oh now is the full send right there I think I would like to play ready or not I'm not gonna get seafood again here oh the VTOL is my most hated kill streak in the game there's nothing worse than a beetle just clear look sir what's ready or not it's a tactical first-person shooter and what I recall originally that game there was only 3 people working on the game but I think they've expanded I think they've expanded their team since then because I've got a long fight and it's on Kickstarter maybe whoa thank you for becoming a new member Johan thank you for the five books Ajay living thank you for becoming a new member appreciate the support guys thank you Parker said John loved your games keep up the good work Thank You Parker appreciate you being a man guys give me those points I'm just gonna chill here come on tape be someone in there still what's up guys they've got a VTOL again haters it's a nice little spot to hold here it comes the VTOL of doom to murder me over and over again gonna be great hey where is it there he is that hey I did it oh you dare point you're gonna make ah poker games planning any hunt videos yeah yeah I've got loader hunt videos in the pipeline so you know the guys that I play with usually Tommy and Adam were throwing again I play with those guys all the time so they actually stream honcho down along their twitch channel so whenever they play I tend to join in but I think I've got like three hours worth of sick games I just need to edit it I need to find space for it too because there's just so much like so much new stuff like in terms of gaming at the moment so there's a lot to cover like there's a lot of new games out like February I thought it was gonna be quiet but really we've had a load of new stuff already I'm not complaining it's just it feels a bit overwhelming at times you know I think we're sport for choice choices gamers why not stream on Twitch it's because my audience is here you know I I don't really have a big following on Twitch as much as I love doing to extremes and it's very different to YouTube my audience is on YouTube you know that's that's the difference and also I love the fact the once I'm done streaming this will be a video you know people can just watch this back they want to I don't think everyone's gonna watch for two hours but you know maybe they can skim through and just and watch it over time or something I don't know but yeah that's the reason why I think YouTube streaming has gone up there as well I me up damn it I'm gonna chase me all that was lucky just gonna go ahead and close that door the next said I always miss you on YouTube it never tells me well if you would like to be informed if you go to my channel and hit the bell and select all notifications and every time I'm live or I propose the video you should get a notification but I only do that if you absolutely want to see everything that I do because otherwise you're gonna get spammed with like once a day with a notification maybe you want it maybe you want that hey I'm not complaining you know I want people to see my videos but I understand that YouTube is so big now and you guys are probably subscribed to sound like how how many channels are you guys subscribe to like I'm subscribed to like 30 different channels so you know you guys are gonna be subscribed to way more than that and can you imagine that if every time anyone did something on youtube like uploaded a video or started a live stream you would just get destroyed by notifications and that wouldn't be good would it near you with that somewhere anyone else here maybe [Applause] ah with that so bad like 20 yeah see so I know a lot of people complain and they're like oh man when someone presses subscribe truly it means that they want to see my videos but you have to think about the user you guys are subscribed to so many channels that if every single channel you subscribe to by default think you've got a notification he would just be like well I don't want this this sucks pain you're giving me way too much to look out here so I understand why YouTube changed everything you know I'd love if everyone saw every one of my videos but you have to be realistic with yourself it's just not possible there's so much content on YouTube on the internet nowadays there there's no way everyone can watch everything you do unless you post it like once a week or something maybe you know like maybe then when you post as regularly as I do I totally understand why people wouldn't want to be spammed oh yeah if you do want to be spammed with notifications and hit the bell and you can see sick players like this one take such a sick play what that's what you're missing out on that is what you're missing out on oh you subscribe to 150 channels holy Hines geez I need to use my [ __ ] Essbase too crowded you have my life [Applause] he's falling back there I could have got way more kills then I want to put this on seal baby's ass right before the game but I mean the game is gonna run out any second it's too crowded Toby oh no how would you get that one kill look how close this game is what the hell everyone Vincent you'll subscribe to 700 channels I don't believe that 300 your subscribe to 600 Curtis and on that guy's got blue laser beams coming out of his good what's the deal with that what's going on there [Music] Wow see I'm subscribed to 30 you guys are subscribed of way way way way way more than me that's mad at so many channels Chuck kozloski said battlefield vs. Cod - not right now I don't think it would be fair yes new map let's go solo runner I swear to god you were in my hell at Lu squad with me last week solo last week I was playing with two angry gamers and their subscribers oh it was tracer rounds I didn't realize you'd get tracer rounds I bought a kinder egg earlier guys I've not had a kinder egg in years I just saw it in the store and I was like you know what indirect time let's go inside it was justice Bieber I'm gonna go with it to Beaver that's how good of a toy it is I literally can't tell what it is so we're gonna go with beaver this is the knife to meet you loadout but we're gonna play em I mean we'll play this seriously soon because this is a rare chance to play the new map from the gecko it's a blueprint for the kilo with tracers just under 15 look at this is crazy man I don't know them up very well because I only played it for about two minutes so it's basically my first time playing the map go well it's not it's like my second time playing the map so if I'm terrible I do apologize more terrible than usual on my heart let's be real with ourselves here so many camping spots on this though that's one thing that I did figure out yesterday I can hear a mad lad gone oh that's out of bounds I'm just gonna drive around in this so I think this is one of the vehicles that was in that

them that often but what i do i've eat the whole box you know that's how I feel about jaffa cakes and if you're not doing it like that then you're doing it wrong nothing like you just have to eat the whole box when was that bit hey can I see this part of the night now yeah this this was a map in modern warfare oh I've got stim on the slowly I think this was in modern warfare 2 was it the first Cod I don't remember but this section here is almost exactly the same I please just get a kill what do you got one yeah one is terrible guys I mean alright we're down to a pistol I'm a thank you Plus strike do I actually eat the box as well no ties so I don't either box do you eat the box I'll tell you what I used to do though when I was a kid which was stupid I don't know why I know why I did this but you know when you get a muffin and the muffin is in that thin white paper you know I'm talking about yeah I would eat the muffin and then eat the paper I thought I don't know I thought it was tasty I guess [Music] I swear that the paper was tasty my ice laughs yeah you eat the paper like did anyone else do that I did too same of course yeah you go eat the paper and my my mom would be like why we did why are you doing that and I would swear it was tasty but really I don't think it was that tasty I probably just thought it was cool but when really it's just really bad for my stomach I'm sure we're not but I'm like 90 years old if I get there the doctor will be like Jack I'm really sorry about this but because you ate all that muffin paper when you were a child take at least ten years of your life it wasn't worth it a muffin paper just wasn't worth it in the end I used to eat the wrappers on the I'm through telling as well you know like starbursts and fruit Ella I used to do the same with that too God knows why I get him I think I did he was ready for me the paper was good kind of GUI are you secure on the plastic from a pepper army oh no that's that's gross demo is so salty

well after second that I move Dillinger do you think bar rail will mess up the ttk in this game like it didn't be a five at the same time I can't wait for it dealin I don't know why I'd like to think not and I think what happened maybe with firestorm and oh Jesus Christ what happened with firestorm is there because they're kind of connected right they're like together it doesn't make sense to connect this game to the main multiplayer does it I hope not anyway you would think it it would work better if it was completely separate wholly screen shake Batman knows a guy there do almost having so much fun then so much fun does anyone know the date of an expected Battle Royale release well it's not even confirmed at the moment the only thing that we saw was that teaser in the trailer that is here although I hadn't but the fact that they teased it I mean it's gotta be coming soon right like it's not it's not on the stage it 100% did on purpose what was it gas is approaching we need to exfil now and then in the in the background there's like a giant gas ring like closing it on the map come on come on Infinity Ward just come out and say it ah I think we've got some box in the chat I

please you're not even real go away good mr. penguin yeah definitely more Sun storm what is going on with the graphics on the gun there why do all my guns have a weird outline how peculiar that booth outlined what has happened we must summon eye care what has happened to my graphics that's so weird yeah another why I've got a shotgun though I should probably have something with a bit of rain my chops are that go finally UAV online now they actually camp in there what are they doing I'm sorry where did that knife go quite clearly threw that knife at that man's face and it disappeared into the abyss apparently then one up here I mean this is the spy isn't it this is a sniper spot right here go right the back there yeah the graphics have gone like minecraft mode on the edges I don't understand what's happened there he's going arrow thing those sounds are crazy on it how that guy's got the akimbo need to work out how to do that all those stupid Minds line stupid stupid mind is so annoying everybody change I don't want a shotgun I that's a really bad idea here I'll go with my beloved mp5 how about that the door there no there's a shadow of something following here that's quiet that's quite deep yeah it's quite deep the shadow could be it could be time it could be the Grim Reaper or you could literally be referring to my grafic split shank [Music] he's a VTOL directly above but then I don't go outside though we didn't wait right there I hate everything about it I'm sorry can someone shoot that please can you shoot Thank You charlie face I like we should think okay if I

Jack console or PC I'm playing on PC dude you see my FS in the top here this game is very really like well optimized on PC get very good frame rates it feels like a proper PC game as well if you know what I mean you know how some games just don't feel like they were paid for PC but this one actually does like the mouse on it's very good very smooth no acceleration or any weirdness like that it runs we're really really well I wish I wish you could turn the announcer off can you actually turn it off does anyone know they spawn on you I'm spawn [Music] okay there's like a whole squad there and these are practically everywhere sorry sorry I mean a fine I go out here I'm dead yeah I'm gonna do it never try you never know need more throwing knife girls I think is this the we yeah this is the this is the we you actually the Wii U version of that volatility don't you guys think it's weird that Paul of Duty isn't on Nintendo anymore because it used to be like I remember when I world at war I think it was world of war came out on the way I think cod4 actually got a Wii port as well but they just don't do it anymore I think maybe for the switches because it just isn't powerful enough maybe that's why when they do like a like a dumb a dumbed down version of it mrs. spot right here Oh because likes which has like adult games on it now like it's not like internal don't have any adult games on they do I was half considering just running at them like a my bladder with their right shoulder I've caught goes for the Wii U but cod ghosts' is a real old gamers now how old is cod ghosts' 20 2014 2013 maybe behind me he was just in the blame I'm engaged oh no got scammed fire thank you for becoming a new member your resolution is done you have a white outline I don't think so I think

for life so I'm trying to find where I can see the history of that so bear with me a second or just ask me ask me what you asked in ciao IKEA IKEA no how you see it then you have to play the holy meatball this one I care Sports Jesus thank you for the 14 what's my favorite battlefield game battlefield - definitely no that's not idea I kind of wanted ghosts in the next game yeah I'm telling you

not IKEA I play hardcore mode or sometimes from zwei sometimes yeah good luck finding I care I'm trying so hard to find IKEA maybe if you call it Home Depot it will work you never know hey mr. night law was so paid in specialist mode for the killstreaks shipment are you having a laugh sona five now that's not for me hey loss home depot Home Depot Oh Depot own Depot I think so skeleton yeah getcha come on um Depot if we don't get it now I'm gonna do gunfight snipers to finish off what's up Andy how you doing a ravenclaw even care dahhh and you use the UM Piett yeah what's my video yesterday okay right engage thank you so much for the ten I'm a big fan I love your videos all the work in detail you're putting in them would love to play again with you one day but anyways what do you think about the new intro if you're referring to the new intro for this game I think it's it's 100% battle royale confirmed hashtag confirmed it's gotta be is gassing the background people dropping out planes the squad's on the ground fighting there's been rumors about a battle rail already anyway so I think it's Battle Royale I don't know how they're gonna do it but I mean come on let's make it happen infinity would I'd love a buffalo in this game and I think if they do it right it could be huge I'm not reading out that name but thank you for the donation nice try like imagine if they do it so it's like all of those because the rumor is that it saw the SpecOps maps and ground war maps tied together ask it looks really big on that date of mine picture that we saw so this is gunfight but snip ins only there's no no tacticals or anything it literally is just my paws off that was like what is one thing you could think of that would breathe new life into the battlefield 5br if it went for you to play and stand alone that's the only way if they went a new content drop if they refreshed the loot table that's the only way job demo said I'm hoping for less looting more shooting yeah I mean if you think about it there isn't really a modern military battle royale game apart from like like a serious one let's say Bob G maybe what else is there brink of Elysium but that's third-person and free to play so I don't know like I think maybe Cod BR is good it's got a big chance for a lot of fortnight players to switch cuz I know at the moment people that are playing for a knight again quite a kind of bored of it because there's just not been like that many exciting update so features for it recently and if call of do come out swinging with a br game you know maybe a lot of those fortnight players would jump over oh I should have got him click click - winds down keep up the pressure Eddie I don't really see that many hackers on battlefield 5 to be honest with you I it just doesn't really happen oh that's not fair I couldn't see that guy at all like I know that there are hackers obviously they were hackers but I don't really see any Asian servers apparently have a big problem with hackers in bi5 but European servers for me I just want being honest I don't really see that many enric is battle rail dying I don't know I just think it needs a fresh injection of something maybe ecology about rails it maybe we go for a falling noscope [Music] I knew is there I saw his little girls sticking out oh no I think I'm a pretty good judge of if someone is cheating or not and yes I know that people can cheat and hide it well like with a wallhack or something but in terms of blatant cheaters like spin butters and just like one-shotting everyone in the game like I don't really see that in battlefield 5 that's quite fun I like that no tacticals or anything it's just literally snipers only one night update too much too fast and now there are out of ideas I'd love I tell you what if fortnight came out next season and when look the game is now there's no building I'd be like yeah ok I'm back in I'm back in is a Korea love youtuber so I'm up against all console players here look at this we've got PlayStation Xbox and PC hey Matthew thank you can you make a video about trying to win a firestorm much you know I've not played firestorm in over a year 5 thought was done dirty little man it never had a chance it never had a chance that game mode was killed before it was even released because it wasn't free to play and it's going up against things like fortnight and pub G which is cheap and free to play such a good morale game as well Firestone was like probably my most enjoyable I'll royale game to be honest I love firestorm I think it was great but they just didn't give it any support it wasn't free to play and you're competing in a free-to-play world like it was really it was just it was ruined from the get-go 1v1 where's this guy ow he's gonna beat me unless I get a six-shot was it no the bots are back please hey Lee no oh they played that well you didn't buy the blue LED light layer beware that that left you didn't buy the blue laser
