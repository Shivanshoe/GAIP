go now yep good oh so this is the first change okay you just fall to the ground yep there's no full damage but no power shooting there's a man here i saw a guy jumping there what he's flying [Laughter] so that'll be the incendiary rounds there's a man flying through the air that was amazing what he hit one of those red gas tanks and flew the other way it's when you get an armor break i think there's someone below me i'll come back to you i'll go i'm a gun there's someone here that's very very weird this body just went flying this body went off a let's go over there damn you could get so many kills in this game mode oh and if you win your um goo lag you get another goo like next time you don't have nick who likes infinite gulags someone over here someone up on the hill right [Music] you can like juggle them in the air like oh god this is really good sniping practice because there's people flying around i feel like playing duck i'll say that carefully i've got no armor whatsoever oh crown a satchel that's handy oh my god nice thank you so beautiful yeah this is so stupid because i'm sorry about it yeah good job good call down here i'll get him with a javelin here we go i'm going for this actual oh that's parachute you can't yep i don't know if that's gonna hit there's a lot of cover there let's see i'm used to joker for years i love the javelin so much i didn't it didn't kill it it just hit it we could go flank this thing yeah moving on did you finish him while he was flying away no he's just downed yeah yeah juggle juggle juggle find one find one where's he gone that's duck hunting that is no oh on me i knew oh my words i'm flying i'm a flying firework if i'm catching jackal oh my god you've gone too far he's he sent me to safety i've got 19 bullets so we'll make it work he's behind the wall there he goes how the hell oh there's someone behind me no way i'm beaming him for your emil oh hello he's in the air he made me fly away he actually helped me he's in the gas now oh we can kill this guy so it turns out stuns flight make your flies are do they yeah we can like fly him into the gas oh he's in the car no way he's gonna make it surely he'll get killed by all the teams up there there's still a bunch of players there broke him he's in the air get him get him yes where's the other team i don't know south east i guess oh yeah one one three there he's bouncing get him away get him out of there get him out of there there's one here in the in the bush in the bush standing what's that with the same i just have some selfies there's one coming in there on green just bounced him he's in the gas bouncing where's the other team i don't know where he bounced to well there he said he'd stop from over he's not behind those rocks there's two left there's one each team can i get to you emil yeah you can't hear yet this is in moving where the hell are they dude i have no idea where they are bouncing around oh i'm being looked at go on there's one there [Applause] ted that's one one more yes he's bounced i can't even see him anymore i've got 13 shots renee now [Applause] both me and jack got our load out somehow things are on the roof hit on [Applause] dude buy station marker what oh you're not seeing those yeah you can drop a buy station [Applause] shotgun haven't won them in a while oh yeah that's making a comeback no no no i did not realize this was a single shotgun right here [Applause] shouldn't have guessed him someone just tried to shoot me with a shotgun from 88 meters away the shotgun yeah tom yeah god that's the quad that was trying to shoot me with a shotgun yeah there's a golden bar that's flawless that's absolutely disgusting well just on this map or on caldera just in general at the moment in the in the circulation in the pool but it's yeah it hits like a bar but it's got a faster rate of fire there it is that's the one nice is it like you can't make it kind of thing in gunsmoke is that what you mean i don't know like i haven't seen one like it but unless unless it's a select array of attachments that people haven't figured out yet i mean the concept of that though would be cool right like if you actually had rare ground loot guns that were better than loadouts yeah that's true but just it makes sense like when they're blueprints like because some of the blueprints are crazy like the way they look and stuff it'd be cool if you had something i think they started talking about having lots of extra attachments didn't they i'm going up inside precision airstrike stroke nice [Applause] [Applause] yep you've got to do this no that was me didn't kill him god damn i don't know they had enough time to reform them all right luckily we've got a loadout right next to there downstairs there's someone downstairs on the ground floor he's going for the loadout nice oh yeah have you seen the um have you seen the swap stations as well jack yeah but i mean i don't really see why you would ever use them they just seem a bit inconsequential it's good if you need money but if you need money and you can pick up like people's um custom weapons and it gives you some really good stuff if you trade basically plus it gets rid of their custom weapons when they left delayed landing that's good you can swap guns for money yes you trade a gun and it'll give you a worse version of the gun but it'll also give you money or sometimes even like specialist tokens and stuff well i've got slight prison top prism ah they've got a good position oh nice fair shake be aware where have you airstrikes sniper in a little [Music] tower guys just jumped off of this tower you might be going for it remember yeah i think so i'm pretty roof again yep he's just gone into that did you get hit yeah i'm not going to push that anymore no yeah coming back it might actually pull towards us if we stay down here you know i mean it's only if we if it doesn't we kind of [Applause] get the headshots boys jesus christ look at that that couldn't have been much better we got a bite you know i'm just gonna keep spamming their strikes behind us yeah down them good down son someone just landed over there how are you not down parking target location you're not down [Applause] [Music] oh everyone gets an airstrike someone just plans [Applause] do you want to buy an ammo thing as well for you run out of money i've got an ammo thing oh you've gone [Applause] i actually feel sorry for them there's [Applause] that's the last team yeah there's someone there someone there jack stand there we go that was cool oh my god that was good dude that was good that was good it was just angry english people on the voice cons as well beautiful
