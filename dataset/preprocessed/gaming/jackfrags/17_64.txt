absolute windfall but with that we need to build we need to buy like what can we buy from her well bong says we need wheat some buns yeah we need to be able to feed all that oh i tell you what tom that electric meat grinder there that's it yeah well we haven't well that's end game we haven't even explored the possibility of pigs and um cows we're just chicken men at the moment we're just we're we're just normal men what's hunter over there can we go hunting i think he well i've never been up there i didn't we didn't range that far there we go what's up here it's it's off road what if there's a bear or like well that's where we've got the revolvers an abominable snowman maybe let's get the wheat back for the chickens the chickens they will you know while we're out here tom the

he's a rabbit thanks what you took some more rabbits around here totally makes sense though the edm let's get back in we need to take a look we need to get this week back to home base we're getting the wheat back to the farm and then we'll have to think about killing creatures i guess yeah we'll all have to go on a hunting trip then nice i've started building the barn as well what are we doing with this grain uh we'll put it in the garage i guess it's gonna get wet out here isn't it yeah uh-huh uh-huh um are we gonna be able to all sleep in the tent i don't know why don't we just make three

this is going to have all our cows and pigs and stuff right oh yeah that's sexy oh no that's lovely though it's gonna be a little long bar as well you finished that one it's red well that door isn't finished yeah you picked the color it's metal there's no gun door arms are in if you're a rancher your barn is red turn off your flashlight i want to see how dark it is there you go oh my god yeah we we we couldn't see it yeah we didn't really playing like that yeah we need some metal to finish this as well these doors take metal okay well look we need to go to bed and then we need to work out we need to do some missions for the rabbit man in the morning yeah jack come have a look and look at the floor of the tent oh wow it's sudden and muddy in the game i can't get the prompter okay i'm in i mean i just see a spooky face your head's submerged in the water guys does that mean you'll die through the night okay easy stop raining i mean like this is why we need three rooms in the house all right well yeah we're like okay so what do we need concrete and a lot like 100 of it you can make cheese in this game apparently yeah horse training what are these chickens doing hunting it's right here on the right it's literally their top hey brenda's not gonna be there though is she i think brenda works all hours jack she's in there she's actually there 24. oh it's closed no open up it doesn't whoa whoa whoa whoa we need to save the bullets we need them we have to buy more oh god okay okay let's find those wolves [Music] maybe we can find their den where they're sleeping i like how she's she doesn't go home or go to sleep she just is still there this is the perfect music for a night hunt i've gone the wrong way what have you said change music up oh god is that bad you can give this meat to the man hey he'll enjoy it have you lost the chicken take it you just dump it on the ground and then you i bought the meat oh wait wait i'm gonna use it i'm gonna do an animal call i've got one of those kazoo things that's a classic isn't it you think this is a good place to go hunting no probably not the hell was that what was that noise what noise i literally heard a bouncy ball i'm serious i heard a bouncy ball i've got a recording of it as well he's gone yeah you've gone you've gone ranch mad you've you've lost in it he's got he's got ranch madness what's the noise about that bouncy ball that's all i can tell you it sounded like a bounce what the hell it's like a stupid superhero low gravity jump keep following this path and you get to the lake let's do it just like that it's not bad [Music] and on that farm oh wow the massive rabbit looks a bit like a wall what is this it's like a wait is that is this an enemy barn it's an fps drop is what it is you've got a tractor wait what can we hide what um i don't alarm you but i'm now running at 10 fps this is a rival barn guys can we torch it none of us have a lighter back in the vehicle we'll go down to the lake we just did a bit of recon there the competition that's all blinding white light there it is that's the lake there's the lake can you swim uh i'm having a little hey you can't go in look you can't go in there what glad to see you partner goodbye you're not that glad also you've got nothing in your house what the g man yeah look at his house jack he's got no furniture wait where are we is there some kind of backstory to this scare that we don't know about i think there is science fiction world we've got these eggs to sell like insane might just cover the fuel that we've used tom [Laughter] look at the sun rising in the mountains jack behind you what a time to be alive you haven't ever seen a sight like it i love how this just does it by itself it's very dangerous machinery just operates itself yeah jerrycan is now empty we'll have to do a fuel run with that it's frolicking jack it looks so stupid tub it looks great and you can jump while holding a log and sprinting yeah the incredibly strong these guys this is farm strong you know smurfs have uh special powers what about the concrete so we can finish the bars well again we're gonna need like more money i didn't really know damn it it's hard being a rancher it is a hard life i'm hoping that the chickens will copulate and and we can make we need pigs well yeah they're 300 depart i feel like i would invest our investments haven't been as sound as they could have been so what have this tom woods the plan you guys chuck it in the barn i've made stacks oh that's quite satisfying actually sleeping with the lord just making stacks of wood oh yeah here we go here we go look at this oh yeah oh that feels good that satisfying [Music] i don't know you aiming your gun at me then drive i was just considering a summary execution see what would happen a thunderstorm but we need some more gas yeah now we know what wow oh god oh god we're fine hit her up jake popping in the outside rear uh that's the jerry can press e to put in oh there it is down there insert there he goes in no no no no no no no no no no no all right let's spit that and then we'll put some of the jelly can as well is there anyone i can't do it in this store no it's completely empty and there's no one there let's see now that's gone in as safe as it is there's a bit of a kink there tom i don't know if that would work how do we bait the animals in jesus christ how are you not dead it's fun what's that noise you just get shot oh it's just understand with ranchers we're made from tougher stuff okay i don't know how we find animals so before there were there were you know there was a couple maybe they don't come out in a storm either no there oh dead head dead where is it i see it get him i need to go i need a clean shot jesus christ jack oh that's a bear tom it's an actual bear how much meat do you think the bear's got him that's got so much meat in it tom i gotta reload tom i've five six shots on it i need a headshot on it though is it wait is it chasing the deer bring it down jack say bring him down jack i don't think my bullets are working in that deer as well just running after it i've only got five shots left um it's just stood i don't think anything is registered it's dead it's dead oh good job i'm out of ammo song oh look at that though we got me is that all four i don't think your bullets were working no they didn't do any damage whatsoever kill that deer nice yeah yours were like de-synced bullets hear the meat from the bear i'll get this guy i'm actually impressed that there's a bear i said it as a joke but it's real i mean the bear looked at one point like he was gonna savage you jack i'm gonna be honest it did but then it turned away or it was just attracted to the deer aren't we all right go to this thing you have to buy some ammo jack i don't know if i can buy it for you because it's like individual press e to use whoa hang on an inflatable mattress time i've got um 209 is that shared
