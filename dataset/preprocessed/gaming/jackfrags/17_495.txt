have you ever wanted to go full aliens well now you can flamethrowers bugs eggs and really really big bugs that's what we're doing in today's video in warface so i've covered this game a couple times before and they've recently switched to seasonal updates and in this vid we're checking out the new special operation swarm and it's quite different from anything that i've tried in the game before it takes inspiration from classic 1980s horror movies which i'm all about from looking at the footage i'm sure you can guess which ones there's new weapons maps armor sets and more a big thanks to my games for sponsoring this video it is free to play on pc ps4 xbox one and nintendo switch if you fancy having a go there's a link down in the description below and i've also worked with them to provide some survival kits to give away to you guys with some real life goodies in them again link down below if you want to enter for a chance to win one of those with that said let's get into the action now with tommy and bong our main objective here is to escort vital cargo through enemy territory and potentially defeat the final boss but will we be able to stamp out the bugs or will they simply overwhelm us with sheer numbers if you enjoy the video leave a like it's time to go hunting that flashlight is ridiculous yeah man you look like you're ready for war i'm ready for war face not my goggles possibly from what we found no it was a rubber duck or something i don't know where we are we're at the marillo hotel it's quite spoopy actually i know that's actually oh there's a problem

the gate's closing activate that boop i don't know if that was a good idea i need to attack anything with intense heat oh defend the air right on the right oh one thousand needed to activate turret two turret one drive look they're attacking the thing they're attacking the thing guys the empty vehicle is getting the bike i'm trying to stop them from reigns look from reigns at the back it's getting demolished this is nail guys they're right about the sniping ones yeah i'm trying to take them out oh my god there's so many there yeah nice i think i can give you ammo okay do the exploding one oh no there's one there's one we did it okay i don't feel like we did it but we did it yes i don't know what the duck is about it's aliens then is that the predator is it oh you can search the rooms for uh resources they're coming out of the grates wow resources where where oh we all get them if one person it's a worm then they are really strong down here there's like nests yeah yeah this is fun what okay don't touch the water at all you just come back i don't really want to go in there back i mean we just saw what happened to tommy you can do it now you can go through and open the door from the other side look come through john there's a door here look oh wow there's a massive machine in here that says activate on it i have to shoot a lock off that's next generation that's me i'm the hacker i'm in the hephaestus flamethrower yes you already get one that's lovely work oh god wait let me let me suck you with this oh it's quite this kind of festus what's it called the hephaestus flamethrower let's just go and investigate all the things and we'll be fine use the planes long you you you lead us now uh yeah we'll do the searching that one we need power to activate that i think what i won yeah that's it oh i've got a flamethrower okay look i don't know what's going on here but i'm activating this machine there we go look simple ow can't believe the armor on it well you need to come to me then guys there's fire in here and you certainly can't just walk past it that's for sure we're gonna need to burn it away but the fire yes you want to burn the fire oh my god yeah that doesn't work okay as far as i can tell you can't burn fire i think we can but i tried to walk past it on this gap on the right and it instantly killed me sprinkler systems the sprinklers got it simple how do we get in there then well there'll be another one uh here okay all right simple i'll open the door i'm using the panel one three two seven 157 we're in upgrade there's one here have you done it have we done it all i think no no i think it takes it does it it upgrades i mean these are a lot easier to destroy now we've got the throwers stand on the top here i think i didn't see him load up the careful exploding bug i know there you go that's great upgrade it as much as we can the turret over here yeah we did upgrade the turret yeah he's doing it now look t-40 sentinel but we can't upgrade the engine we don't have enough to upgrade then leave let's go we must protect samantha she is a sacred sacred chap oh can we upgrade it on the fly don't get run over by salad i got turret going that's cool samantha is sacred why do they just attack her all the time i've never stopped playing is it just shining a red light at them why what's it doing it appears to me does that hurt them he going to barge through here it's about to do something samantha has been taking damage i need help out here guys i just got a load of resources come kill the eggs coming back and i can't even kill it in one grenades samantha's not looking too hot right now you guys abandoned her i went i got a load of resources ah here's the upgrade room look good what do we upgrade what's more important well i think she needs armor really maybe speed though zogs don't want to go too fast because she'll spawn more enemies well i've got 2 400 we can do two upgrades no engine revival engine and armor yeah i don't know how much damage that's how much they are oh it's 2 000. oh it's armor yeah that's a good call let me through i'll keep you down that's not good this room was bad come on jack oh god okay it's fine it's fine no no nothing here use a gun when's the next upgrade room but probably at the end oh we've got to push this out of the way oh my lord was that a free upgrade that's a free cannon are you gonna shoot that well i guess this is the final section she gets her main cannon he's fully armored and ready to go i was just some kind of giant bug at the end oh there's something sniping from miles back yeah see if i can get it i need help watch out for exploding exploding i need ammo guys oh yeah suck me that's it suck me oh god there's something huge behind that door the queen generator come on i'm pushing this one guys keep shooting in the mouth you keep shooting keep shooting guys push i got it i got it cover oh that one's done i'm not taking any damage yet god he seems angry shoots her ass in the face in the face so she's taking damage we need a rocket launcher or something so that's a please samantha needs to fire more at stage one i mean i feel like samantha didn't do enough there barely touched her i suppose if you have one flown through each side yeah and then yeah and then just one person in the middle constantly shooting the ones i'll push push come on come with me you can't bring it because the snipers all right okay i mean i'm healing as well now it shouldn't expose us i don't think it's her ass something oh my god you shoot his mouth to stop it firing watch out for bugs i'm only really worried about the sniper ones to be honest without justin you come out in the mouth in the mouth all right i'm gonna i need to hear you tell you can no kill you that's like a shock wave attack it's angry why aren't you firing samantha's firing a turret do more samantha by the cannon i can't get you no no no it's done unless you could beat this stage oh god swarm anubis blackout look at this oh no mantillas that was really difficult so there we go guys unfortunately we couldn't beat the big boss i think we needed to have a medic there and
