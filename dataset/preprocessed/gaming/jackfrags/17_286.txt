along to the stream and if you're watching this as a vod appreciate that hit that like button as well and if you're new here make sure you subscribe for more i haven't really done a live stream on youtube for ages so i think this is going to be good just going to unmute and see if the boys are ready is the xbox game bar yes dude it took me a full weekend okay that has to be it what did i just unmute to what's going on because of sea of thieves did this happen to me okay hold on let me let me see how did that feel have you heard about the new sea of thieves update no what happened with pirates of the caribbean oh come on tom that's really immature what we're going to do with them what are we going to do with them i i should have seen that one coming man you certainly didn't no i didn't the joke continues what's the problem tom okay so tom random like go to your xbox game bar open your game bar up go to the uh in the top bar you'll see this there's a settings icon on the far right there next to the time uh yeah settings right and go down on notifications and then the top one silence notification sounds that top one needs to be checked on and then i can just press x and it'll save it yeah even if everything else is off you still getting i i still got notifications dude that sound was so annoying it's been happening for like a week or so yeah i bet you that's what it was i have had that second computer i made a new account i added myself and i was sending myself friend requests just to try and figure out how i went through every setting it doesn't matter if it's off i had that off i have all notifications off on my computer perfect i went through tested everything i have all the sounds off for xbox invites didn't matter still and it needed to send me an unknown a notification sound good it drove me crazy dude so it just wants to take over your pc yeah there must have been like one or two people out there because it only ever happened while i was streaming too i would start up my stream and then i would just get a whole bunch of these alerts that would come through so there's like some people who knew how to do it and they just kept on got him got him or they just saw me online i don't know maybe that was it maybe it was just unintentional maybe probably not but he's probably not going to is that actual connor yo get in connor i got him did send him an invite he's in he's batman with a crossbow what up connor yeah yeah we tried we're roaming is this what we're doing already um should we lobby on connor then that's yeah i'm here for anyways just those canadians those sweet sweet canadian lobbies it's all right you know what i gotta get my friend somehow jack you know yeah that's connor's raven software cosplay is kind of a rave guys did you get it do you remember raven the tv show jack standing corner won't but raven what was it about don't tell me it was about a bird this guy was like called raven and he turned into a raven and fly off and he set like challenges through some woods in the uk kind of like uh jungle run if you ever watch that or like i remember that's so raven random okay you guys had a third time yeah yeah yeah that's all right oh damn so this raven was a cartoon tom was it was it live action no no no live action raven uk show oh yeah i just googled it okay right i remember this now although it aired in 2002 and so that means i wasn't really watching cbbc at that point in my lifetime you're just yay i wasn't really a cbee bees at that age you know i still watch i still watch teletubbies to this day do you every night before i go to sleep nunu is my favorite that doesn't even surprise me it's like it's like it's like friends for me you know i can just rewatch those episodes because they're so like classics especially when that one episode when dipsy's go on carry on tipsy is what time carries on thingy uh accidentally yeah went into pose circle thingy and there was all of that controversy all right like writing into the bbc like this is subliminal just join the lobby tom i think i've accepted right okay no you're not in here too busy looking up teletubbies did you hear about the new save thieves update connor which one was it the one we already caught in your mouth he just did that joke on stone wait what i didn't even hear him it well good it wasn't it wasn't great it wasn't great i'm expecting nothing less yeah tom it was another show in the uk it might have been a bit before before your time though called nightmare that was kind of a similar thing to raven do you remember that oh i have i don't need to watch that show but you were on it i just have i just have them every night so they would get the they would get the children and they would put a helmet on them with horns on and then um one of them was like the the adventurer but they couldn't see because they had a helmet on right and then they would be reliant on their teammates who could speak to them to say okay go forward two paces left two paces and and then it was cool i don't know why it went away if they made like a real version of it today where you could just sign up with your friends and just go yeah i'm there i'd do that that'd be great yeah so it was called nightmare nightmare with a k yeah as in night in china like night of this yeah yeah are we are we going to queue is everybody in here sorry i'm making classes well we're all good to go okay should be able to do this in time honestly tom when you were eight years old and you got home from school that was incredible because you always wanted to be the kid i don't think anyone ever won it was really difficult i see it's hard to find information about it because there's so much like it's old black as batman stuff oh right from that nightmare sequence yeah yeah but it's an it's an 8.1 on imdb tom oh wow high reviews then 90 of users on google like this tv show critics loved it they did they thought it was great is it just like a couple of kids submitting their reviews while they're in spaghetti all the reviews just from me tom if i'm honest with you oh okay are you live jack yeah oh the first 10 the first 10 minutes on my vod are just going to be absolute nonsense have you guys played about [ __ ] no no jesus i blame tom entirely yeah [Applause] oh i need to change my uh my mouse dpi don't i i've got some new scenes as well guys look at this check this out wow look at that how incredible is that and then i can do stuff on my pc like alt tab and change my mouse sensitivity and it won't look weird on the stream it will just be that cool thing there how about that wow how about them apples then we tab back in the game just like this then i press the button on the stream deck game and then we're back in the game look at that it's magic why are my textures absolutely chalked what's happened i think we're just gonna go with it you know it is what it is right let's see if we can get this first game in the bag then oh my textures are completely ruined for some reason i don't know why do you see through the floor not quite it's just a it looks like quake one oh yeah then yeah it might come back might come back no i think you have to restart for that one where are we going i don't know we got some action coming in here though contact moving there was one on the roof with you there stone all right yeah he went into the stairwell there standby for coordinates that i saw at least one was just oh there's another one here that's one of you one's just [Applause] oh yeah look at this guy as well

here somewhere i'm above you guys yep nice yeah give a little hug did you yeah yeah yeah we both came around the corner at the same time just we couldn't get past each other i feel like i lose a lot of the fights with the ppsh teammate it's not what it was my time i won with my pistol so i'm happy it's an edition conor is it true that that game broke your graphics card new world yeah that's true really yeah how crazy is that yeah friday that's crazy does your graphics card really [Applause] [Music] yeah they're all dead maybe one landed on a roof i just saw people fall out the sky should we get uh loadout guys over here yeah i'm coming over here i just got shot from here i always forget what i put on the skin the reason i shouldn't be using it i sound like i'm playing wearing a latex suit or something when i run honestly connor if you stand in front of this bus here standing from that bus you blend in so well with that bus specifically but everything else no everything else not so much yeah what about the box wait wait what about the box where have you gone connor i can't i don't know can you see uh need a bit of money son sure connor's gone now so oh there he is i can just see his head right here what how did you do it crazy dude what the hell hey man how did you do that i got extra spring in my stuff okay leave me alone all right that's it that's a me problem i may be using like the worst setup you could possibly use what do you guys think a dragon of penigalo oh come on come on come on now go now come on swiss are you still trying to do that yeah it's literally the worst gun in the game jds is slower with iron sights oh i know i know i picked yours up before i don't like that song nah yeah that's not okay i just i like pain before using that yeah iron sight swiss okay nice see let's see what it looks like you guys got you have any plates yeah i'll drop you come on nope okay absolutely there you go you want to just use a regular optic though um this is going to be so bad it's not it's not as uh attractive in a title oh yeah you get more views that's true though people just want to see you go through pain now there's nothing to do with lord do you like that it does uh yeah no that's true i played warzone but every time i got a kill i stepped on a lego you wouldn't have a foot by the end of that you stepped on a like you stepped on a lego parts of the caribbean don't do the joke again fire to the caribbean he just keeps going until he gets a laugh you know even if it's from themselves actually how to parse the camera and update see ya thieves did yeah got him again he got him again the pain's not just about playing the game it's about playing with tom yeah that's that's my challenge for today that's the real challenge hey jack yeah oh scanner [Applause] if you use that you can tell if they're inside you would say that [Music] uh yeah sure i'm not gonna have any of these shots anyway thank you there you go just so you know chat tomo is running the iron sight swizz loadout tonight he intends to play it like a shotgun so let's see how that works out for him oh yeah no the dragon was horrible recall-wise my plan is just to shoot at people but get no kills today headshot right that's my title i [Music] what uh what happened with you and the dragon of uh tom what do you think about the dragon off the dragon off yeah it's too busy trying to make come on tommy [Laughter] [Applause] oh i didn't even see that one coming wow you buy me new ears too yeah um yeah it's gonna graphics so it did ruin your graphics card what are you using now connor 280ti well that's not bad oh did you get your 2018 oh no yeah i'm good yeah let me borrow it sorry i drove over and snagged it back from him was it an ebj yeah my 30 90 was the evga it seems like those and amd had some issues too i think it was one set of gpus that they had [Applause] i guess it revealed like a weird flaw in the 30 90s and evga say that they would refund them or like replace them though if it happened or something yeah yeah is that what you're doing oh yeah i'll be getting a new one oh sweet you just have to pay 250 for the shipping oh why shipping rates right now are insane jack serious i didn't know that yeah you have to ship it to the us yeah that's why when you when you cross the border like it gets crazy time contact that kind of vehicle yeah oh there's a car behind us oh it broke him i mean i barely shot at anyone in this game okay what was that actually that was it it does sound cool yeah it sounds really nice surprised let's take it back dragon's just the best gun in the game you got one kill with it was that body shot no bother headshots i think oh you got i don't only had one bullet you going for the bouncy stuff um i don't know i'm just kind of seeing where you guys want to go here we got the contract to the left that's farther away yeah the bounty's closer there's no one in our building oh thanks i'm glad that you threw that grenade to check for me you're welcome because we would have seen them like a wall hack yeah oh it does seem like that's the case at least yeah i'm jumping in you could test it for a video [Music] well someone sniped at me oh they're in the comments oh yeah the guy above me right now oh dude he's got beams he's jumped off the other guy he's outside here now we're being tracked enemy soldier one down on the roof my roof yeah yeah right above you i think he's the only one on this roof everyone's always on either one see if you can finish him good job of course do be like that sometimes changing my plan next roof over uh beyond the bank let's see some of this dragon off then connor come on come on everyone's waiting you're asking for a lot of yourself and i've saved you from seeing that kind of two on my bank i don't suppose i could get my gear got off my bank yeah yeah you can land back are you serious uh i'm in this area i don't know where the other team was i killed you he's there tom right there i just marked him he's running into the building now he's in the building i think he's in here my [Music] [Applause] between us now second floor well there's a car over there he might have i mean he might need like stunned or something [Applause] i'm gonna go see if my gear is there what's wrong uh he took my uh my swiss nice i don't know where the other guys don't just kill them kill him i might be part of the same team that was the team oh we got two here is that my sword maybe yeah that's my source i think there's three dead here now one up one up on the staircase and then two on this roof yeah yeah yeah also though there was a res behind us on yellow one i bought jack there oh yeah yeah there you go it's too fighting yeah that's probably the guys that i i don't know maybe there's a lot of action going on hey that's what we like to see let's go [Music] i don't know where these guys are jack uh ground level he was just shooting at you wasn't it yeah [Music] getting i'm trying to shoot down the turret for you guys okay white purple close i think we're clear at the back here stone okay i've got the street sweeper where's the gallow forgotten earlier yeah more that we're looking at us from the south here though right was that that guy up by train yeah [Applause] he's trying to [Applause] [Music] i think there was a there was a buy back here right uh there you go there's a little uav over here uh southeast on that green mark on the hill there yeah gotta bought my this armor box in case we need it do you want someone with tom or are you okay uh i could do with some armor unless there's a load of satchels here if you're quick oh my god yeah that's a cluster there oh my god down here i want to swing around on this hill want to inject or do you want to hold that yeah let's go let's go i was just enjoying the swiss there yeah they're up the hill on the left here i think we can take this just crossed crossings i think yeah far right outside oh my god no hit armor break second floor any tappers yeah i'll get you come on okay thank you out on the roof left side uh okay no it wasn't me it wasn't me or did someone get rest i responded sniper out the east window they're gonna go down right now yeah yeah yeah okay that's that's what i was saying i was gonna yeah yeah gotcha that's what i was gonna say oh he's in that building further we couldn't go up further if you guys wanted to get really high up oh he's in this building there bro [Applause] um i can't see anything it's so blurry durable gas mask with two bars better than one that's full i took the fall over no yeah i'd say take the full one probably i think the durable is just normal there's a guy right here with a streller he's moving back this way we're gonna have to go up the hill we can either do an hour later yeah let's go let's plank right go up here yeah i'm down i'm done come up get a vehicle if you want you're out here to do goes right along right again [Music] oh this is a bit sus sauce yeah it's just a bit no this is big sauce i'm going to pop a uav here should i buy an air strike right now i'm going to buy one this guy's gonna be coming off the buy station and we got a lot that are gonna be coming from that bottom hill there's no grip with a 3.25 ounce right i don't think so i don't believe so we're in safe zone top oh dead oh my god you don't need an optic you're nuts shotgun swiss let's go shotgun swiss it's like slow grounds not better in warzone but better or mozart full tile let's find a good title for tom i used to switch with iron sights it was not worth it and i'm questioning reality the secret shotgun sniper in cold war zone is incredible three times now let's line them up first and then we can knock them down from there ultimately tom if you're making a video and i'm gonna watch it i need to know is it like a wall hack jack yeah that's a good question jack you're really considering a lot of options no that was so close honestly we nearly didn't res him we nearly didn't res him all right wow he's over here it's only one guy he's over here what a game like you know what i'm going to run outside into the airstrike here this should be a good fly 4v1 yeah this is how i'm going to collect it right now watch this there's a building next to me but i'm going to stay outside i'm going to go outside i did it i used the dragon wow good job how many kills you get i think i killed one eleven dude that's really good that's very solid i have 11 kills and i got one kill with the child that's just high all that connor what's your time [Music] it's like slightly off method it's like one day past expiry day yeah i've turned it off i love that extra flavor now are you gonna use that again tom that gun again yeah i actually had a decent match over there okay yeah yeah yeah i had seven kills and five of them with the twist yeah and i know at ranges were more beneficial to use oh guys that was a good first game thank you for coming along to the stream i appreciate all the members and very very generous super chats thank you so much guys i'm just going to read through a couple of these now i need to sort this out so when i press this button the youtube chat comes up because i can do that on twitch i had it earlier but i've not set it up for youtube yet but you should hear some music now as well um but let's see who's in the stream let's have a look uh wba thank you so much for the five glad to see you back streaming nathan thank you for the five appreciate that man it's very kind of you

appreciate that [Music] what's up ebony hello chase julian hey geeky what's up man how's it going good to see you in the chat thank you for coming along hey oak crows ryan jeremy i don't know dave my textures were just ruined in that last in that last match for some reason i don't know why i think they're fixed now though right looks like they're fixed uh inside you thank you for the sun hope you're enjoying the start of the week yeah i've had a very busy day um but uh it's gonna be a good week what's the best class setup right now i think you want to be looking at the c-58 the krig the modern warfare mp5 the cold war mp5 the swiss as a sniper maybe mac 10 smg milano for an all-round sniper support like those are you go to better options right now there's a lot of good choices at the moment what do i think of the tundra it's fine with an i'd never take it over the swiss yes james he is yeah intron yeah the joke about the spy skills why not what's up tim hey jack dono secret dice interviews not today yeah we're playing with stone acolyte and tomographic today yeah ak was really good then jakob it's pretty good [Applause] i don't think that's the real the baby by the way maki i don't think he would be watching my youtube stream that'd be cool though is it blue games battlefield is better though right huh i don't know why we pulled out that one pain kind of just needs to restart he's got the 30 fps bug okay cool you are not the party leader you're supposed to host the party no join it disband it and again so they refunding your evga or trying to repair that i had the choice between the two oh really um i'm pretty sure i could get a refund or just get a new one but with how difficult they are to get that's what i mean you'd have to wait a while probably yeah i'm sure they fixed the issue now anyways right now yeah exactly yeah i saw that uh new world posted an update to fix it on their side as well yeah they're just limited it was just loading screens apparently yeah um yeah for some reason i guess like loading screens ran your game at like a million fps for some reason okay it's so weird because it's just one frame so weird it's funny how like that exposed the flaw in the gpus or the firmware or whatever it was right runs too hot and nathan what can we expect from you when bf 2042 comes along oh boy nathan it's going to be mad it's going to be absolutely mental i think i'm going to be streaming a lot of that game we're going to be playing all that warfare we're going to be making custom game modes on portal and we're going to be checking out hazard zone i think in terms of video content maybe guides highlight videos that kind of thing but yeah i'm gonna go heavily into streaming when bf2042 comes out what's up nova eric thanks for the 20. yeah i'm really really really looking forward to bf now it looks sick man honestly like i said in that last video i just think they're ticking all the right boxes with it you should try uh split gate i've already done a video on split gate cool guy when it was out last year they did a really early alpha for it and i had a look at it then it's cool it's like portal and halo had a baby that's

halo it's gonna open up the game to so many people just the multiplayer is free to play i just want to caveat that i don't i think you have to pay for it if you want the single player and co-op and all that stuff but multiplayer is free to play yeah halo is going to be big this year [Applause] thank you 6. rebirth edition i'm just waiting for it to come back again yeah yeah you think it will oh yeah oh yeah i'm counting well i mean they changed it so now you can if you're outside of the zone for a longer period of time it gets worse right yeah but that didn't matter they made that change and then someone was still doing it past that yeah it's supposed to be cumulative damage right oh my goodness dude the best gun in the game and there's the one kill we've been [Laughter] [Music] owen

the wheel i'll take the wheel stop it [Music] this was connor with a super silent dragon no no no i bet that's like the best thing in dragon of uh in modern warfare what do you reckon what's that jackson do you think the dragon is good at modern warfare or um it's actually yeah it's one of the easier weapons to go in uh oh shoot and i missed them i couldn't snipe them maybe that was why well that variance just got away dude we're screwing yeah [Applause] maybe that's why i kind of hit him does anyone else know you bammo yeah i'll give you a click here then you got your three yeah that's that's [Applause] there's more in there if you want to get there right oh you need me oh i like that for a second faster because we have money i mean i didn't choose the wrong loadout what uh yeah there's a loadout coming in 20 seconds yeah i get it's my right loadout or do i go for ghosts that's the question though you know you want to get another one on top of that i chose the wrong one so i'm kind of not in the greatest position but it's okay i mean it's okay we can get you another logo i'm gonna go back and get the vehicle we'll just get some uavs rolling that's okay someone should use the next game like if you put the name of the weapon you're going to be using your title today because that's false advertising no no i'm using i'm using the qbz right now but i just chose the wrong attack oh my god all right that's good what do you think about it that was great that's what i used last game really yeah it was really good i don't think i've even leveled that one i was messing around well they just buffed it they increased the min damage and the multiplier on it and it finally is like actually killing people [Music] what [Music] unfortunately [Music] vehicles oh i

thank you for coming what's up samuel are my cheats on yes ahmad yeah cheats are on wall hacking aimbot today hey craig finally caught a stream gg relieved your arc videos comedy gold oh man when art came out survival evolved great that was just such a mad time they had a content creator server like a role play server and there was some just really talented people on it who they just got crazy with their characters you know what's up proxy hello jack mcguinness where can we share clips just wherever you want share everyone thank you matthew uh akshay fifty dollars dude that's very kindly man thanks uh abe what am i most looking forward to in battlefield 2042 portal i think just being able to experiment with stuff like i want to see or you know specialists are a hot topic i think in the community some people don't like the idea of a unique character i suppose with a unique trait and a gadget you know battlefield hasn't really done that before um and i know that some people would like to disable that on their own custom servers so let's say you wanted to run a game which was bf3 era on a 2042 map and then you disable specialist but you give the guns you give all the guns so you've got 2042 guns bf3 guns bc2 world war ii guns you know then you've got a traditional battlefield experience i suppose hey johnny mb thank you for the five since daisy love you see super thanks the triple airstrike was so satisfying yeah past trick it was good man it was good ahmed all the love from egypt thank you yeah i haven't played the new version of split gate yet vibe or yeah vibe i guess that's how you would say that class setup yeah i'll show you guys that's what i've gone with works really well it's been doing good doing good in the game so far and the swiss that i'm using this one here yeah that's a really good setup for the swiss and then i just run the classic um overkill to start with eod over kill amps and then switch to ghost afterwards i'd love to play with dr disrespect jeremy i don't really know him though like i don't really have any contact with him uh bearded pizza my son and i love your videos jack keep it up thank you thank you very much bearded i'm glad that you watch the content no it's not my birthday because him did i like black ops 3 multiplayer not really wyatt no hello robin from finland what's up where did you download warzone just on battlenet on pc you just installed that on it does the green flashing dots not bother you now i don't really care you mean like this stuff here no it doesn't bother me the ak looks so ugly with attachments yeah unfortunately though it's not very good without the attachment so i think it looks kind of cool with that classic skin on it uh i see would you say the reason there's no br in poor would be because there'll be a br for 2042. i've seen they said there is no battle royale for 2042. they've said that several times so i don't think it's gonna happen right have i seen some of the olympics yeah yeah i have colombia i'd love to visit daniel one day ever tried foxhole no but i know what that is gw thank you is the wise star boy what's up it's the balkan skin a milsim operator have i played cod mobile yeah a little bit not much so gabe yeah there's a new hell let loose update tomorrow it's huge they've got the east and front they're adding the russians and a load of new guns and vehicles so i'm definitely going to check that out standby for deployment to the war zone uh karen yeah i'd love to thank you swede what's up man thanks david thanks for the five i'm your favorite streamer that's uh that's very kind of you david all right let's do this battle royale be advised gas is closing in did you listen to any of the new phone jackers stuff on spotify no i didn't know that was the thing yes what eight episodes well about 15 minutes no it's brand new but how are they allowed to bring that back well he just did it he just recorded it by himself and put it on spotify just it's just a lot less offensive well listen to it for yourself i mean it's just as funny as it used to be i can tell you that all right okay um i've watched six of them there's eight it's just it's just audio on spotify video okay yeah yeah for free as well because that's a video on spotify podcast now tonight i'm so dead [Applause] see i told you what are you doing buddy i did not see anyone in the entire engagement he's just hiding from me are these are the red doors still spawning uh stadium i think you can get some there yeah probably i don't think they would change it around that fast yeah [Applause] there was a couple games i thought it was last year no problem [Applause] is the ksp actually decent now oh no okay i mean it's a burst i smg it was actually one of the guns that didn't get touched jack but it's still like so the damage profile is still so low it's not good yeah i just wonder if there's like a weird way you could build it like a dodgy build for it that would actually be good a rapid fire barrel or something that makes it more more like full auto they could just make it full auto yeah well that's the unique thing about it right but i think they learn their lesson after all the burst first matters oh m16 cold water i never thought we'd see like the dmr era again and then that came along yeah it's pretty rough [Music] for this one i think i like the sound of that somebody left daddy here as well bringing it with the metal yeah okay in your jacket trophy i know it's quite good quite good actually it's just i can't see it change it really good sniper support weapon the ak all right passenger i'll try no one's allowed to judge me but whatever i'm already good what did you do connor oh my god well you can melee people through buildings so like jack stand he was probably about yeah and i was here and there was a windowsill right at this doorway and i hit him what did it lunge you through the window or did it just hit him it just stopped

it dude i know why have i not done this sooner gas is coming guys we're going to go for rest just outside of gas yeah let's move left towards my bikes go to the cord goes to the cord if someone just

more i got myself rest here nice job a nice thing down to the right as well they'd be risking positioning if you went for it can we i mean maybe we could go for the rest if you can get on that far right kind of far you've got 30 seconds to do it you could yeah you could make it you only have 20 seconds though you have a mask yep here take my money i'll try and defend if you get it cause they'll probably be looking at us going to other teams i love this i love this thanks jack huge true savior oh in the window there you go you can play one of them okay so oh he's here behind the pile on there

top knock on top two more five nice boys that craig is just it's silly man they need to know like it's just it's pinpoint accurate it hurts though like it's not like it's just a female like it hits hard it's not the craziest way to fly it's kind of like all day but yeah even the creek with a 3x and a sniper is what uh i've even been running with it feels so good what's the thing since they added the uh they made the was it the cold war for x scopes are smaller now uh there's less visual recoil because of it the crossover doesn't bounce around as much yeah you played really well there guys please yeah sealed i love that you're using the calisthenics in 2021 in july in warzone using calisthenics jack actually all right so yeah there's no way i'm having voice comes on when i'm on youtube

think he's awesome aka ak now there's see ccd i don't know sorry i don't think i could do that either he's only a knife or around nicholas that would be so painful what's up sparky why is the rest of the party chat so quiet i didn't even realize stone was in the squad i think he's probably just talking to his stream scott he's probably talking to his stream what's up slippery hey rex kevin hunter welcome your cat went to heaven i'm sure that they're living the dream in heaven chasing around mouse playing with balls of yarn eating cat food you know that's what the cat's doing so chris do i enjoy streaming more in the morning or the evening i don't really care deacon to be honest i might stream tomorrow morning with the boys with studying wester when's the next battlefield 4 live stream jack i can't do battlefield 4 live streams i can't do battlefield three four five or one live streams because i play on pc and whenever i do a live stream i get targeted by people um and it's very easy to hack on those games so people can just get a new account really easily on ea play or whatever it is buy a cheap copy of the game and they follow me around servers and just rage hack the servers it's happened like the last five times i tried to stream a battlefield game on pc so i really hope that the new battlefield game actually has a good anti-cheat because if it doesn't it's going to be quite difficult for me to stream it you know so yeah all those people could just stop doing that to me that would be nice but you know i don't think they will it's just the internet man so yeah we'll see i mean i'm i'm really hoping that there's a good attitude for the next game the guy that i interviewed tompkins he did actually mention it as well so you know positive vibes and everything let's hope what's up mr thor me thank you for becoming a member mb dr disrespect what's your whole portal vid the other day you need to play with him again i said earlier i'd love to but you know i don't want to be that guy that's like yeah hey doc you want to play uh robert thanks for the five i'm having a rough time right now watching your vids always helps robert what are you going through man i hope you get better soon you feel better i hope it's okay do i still enjoy war zone jack yeah yeah i mean if i didn't enjoy the game i wouldn't play it i think it's the best battle royale by a long shot you've got gas closing in fast get to the safe zone here's a good spot i'm going for a red door oh there's another one here right now too yeah i think there's two spawns on yellow one on purple and i think one or two on blue as well you guys go through the first one i'll go through the next one uh it will teleport you elsewhere though that's fine don't mind that yeah but he'll get another advanced uav i'll come with you thumb gotta move stack of money down there [Applause] okay that's all yeah that's how i ping stuff now shooter dropping shoes there [Music] can't we do a trick with the miniatures box and the sentry gun on the vehicles you can but there's nerfed it now to it well look at some nerf but the vehicle doesn't transition oh no no no all right then there's a car here do you have the ammo box yeah i'm in trouble oh you have the hammer box on the sentry right because i'm i'm in trouble there's a full team around me but they can't get in [Applause] oh no yeah i think once you open it they can come in so just put it in the middle tom yeah yeah i'm going to take you back advanced don't fight for a challenge i appreciate it okay so put the ammo box on the star i thought it was locked yeah and then just try and put it on you just have to keep doing it yeah until it sticks i guess is that right what are you guys talking about trying to get the turret to stick on top of the ammo box oh i think they fixed that when you put the ammo box down and you try and um put it on top it like bugs the bumps bugs the vehicle out it starts flying last time you remember yeah it's happening we yeah to my knowledge you just put the muni down and then you just try and keep spamming clicking oh is that it's a there you go okay oh what the hell looney tunes or something whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what the hell yeah we went into spider-man into his father verse and god got the 20 fps whilst everything else was in 60. well they obviously haven't fixed

half these inside snipes are at range one of you guys ping someone to shoot whether it was whether he's parachuting oh he's playing the guy was down top that's like 90 percent of my character is iron

yeah we take this roof again i like the sound of that i like it 30 meters there's one at least one in there yeah by yourself jack with commander connors money uh airstrike maybe just think how are we gonna oh yeah it's clear yeah the guy didn't have anything anyways he's the rest of where [Music] i literally can't do anything time to get thumbnail on me very sure i look pretty thanks jack oh no what's up better man ben how you doing victor i just wish you could do more easter egg content yeah i love making easter egg videos victor but you know they don't come along that often you know because it's reliant on easter eggs so i suppose there we go are you shooting us though good got one underneath the building here just in the archway he's broken i saw one running around there so far got one in the window i think back here it's not rendering in though no it's just ice cream res down here yeah oh wow that's not actually nice whoa where did they go i thought [Applause] you've got him [Applause] armor hits on him [Applause] there's two there's a rose as well [Applause] are they on your side yeah [Applause] i had one knocked i'm leaving i'm going yeah 10 seconds careful time if you land there i'm not going to bother you are they still there yeah yeah yeah i mean they're gonna have to jump though we could get revenge for me uh yeah oh it's up high though tom um okay i'll be a bit tricky another one for you [Applause] [Applause] is that is that other supply run lower you see there we go well there is a buy here you see him still um when in the building lost him in the tree line oh my goodness you don't need a creek when you get sniped that good stats i don't see these guys um yeah i've lost them are you saying 50 meters 50 meters in here somewhere i can push with you do i have a pistol but i can be the bait enemy uav over here oh he's not he's up he's right here damn it i thought he's in the building finish the mission well i need to play now because i can't yeah he was starting a rosebush dude is there a most wanted anywhere um jesus boys well he asked answer that question [Applause] try and get one [Applause] maybe grab the truck first i don't really want to go over there though i think he's the last of the group he has wiped everybody else you shot that guy prior to me getting there jack yeah he's fighting back though on yellow [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i wish [Applause] look at that angle it's a popular uh i don't know what to do now is that truck near this one huh uh there's attack rover yeah why not way out there so that might be a person not hiding out there maybe i don't know if it spawns way over there there's this satellite now so like i forgot the most wanted target stay frosty i'll go for this one yeah that might be a team there [Applause] they're behind you [Applause] keep skating on your knees you're fine yeah this guy's hacking he knows where jack is at all times perfect for you [Applause] they're not gonna come over okay i think you're in the best spot right now i don't think there's a better spot to go to be honest unless you hold a building because all the way up here on yellow is just open i'm a very easy snipe though that's the only thing is he's striking you nice i think he's going to someone else i think he might have just like he you know you catch the leaves of it it's happened to me so many times this isn't a bad build is it this stoner right no no no it was the blue it's pretty good it's not loadout but oh yeah i'm lucky man it hurt me down like a dog gg yeah that rose was on alert when i landed she's just sat in a rose bush ready for me i must have heard your shots nearby i'm panicked yeah it was the rose that you buy not the battle pass one the all green outfit i think we fought her earlier yeah not many people use that skin nope well we couldn't win that one guys unfortunately um i think most one it was my only play there and then three people came to get me [Laughter] tricky you know tricky it's some nice snipes though in that one um end goal thank you for the two it's very kind lovely jack keep up the good content thanks ryan cheers for the five hey jack hope your tailbone stuff
