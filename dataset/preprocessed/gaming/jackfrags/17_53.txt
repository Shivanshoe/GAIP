oh my god what is this another weekly mission and it actually unlocks something that looks good what so this is the veil threat headgear for rao come on let's be honest here that's the are you assault from bf4 what we gotta do to get it then earn three intel ribbons okay defeat 20 enemies of vehicles capture or neutralize 10 objectives people are going to be playing the objective today maybe i should play as pake and just spam the wall hack thing in the sensor grenades that'll do you know what i'm going to use the scar because i just i don't think i've ever really used that much and then i want c4 proc sensor all right we're good to go let's do this okay right this should be pretty good up here this is going to be enemies around so a scan there's one person here somewhere apparently what the what are you doing there oh my god they nearly killed me i popped the thing again look oh there's loads there's so many are you coming lads you coming oh god i'll take it back i'll take it back you're friendly it's fine all right let's go back down are they gonna run in here oh damn it [Music] i think i've got my first intel ribbon then well that's like three kills at least there's some up there as well if is that going to keep spotting them i think it will won't it yeah what the look all these bodies oh man that scar is actually pretty good it feels quite meaty anyway when it shoots i don't know how much damage it's pulling out though but it seems high little head there look at that that's cheeky hit my scan yeah it has a lot of wobble on it you know a lot of side to side horizontal recoil but when you get it down it's nice angel with the head glitch there you want to go have you killed him oh you're dead come on peek me let's go yes what is this area of the map i think i've ever been here they've got control over there scanning there's a guy back there okay nice little burst that seems to be quite effective intel ribbon yes and cut this objective that's gonna go towards it isn't it in between the amazon shelves there that's an ntw 50 i don't really want to challenge that who killed you come on oh you're up there that's a cheeky little spot did you see the amount of enemies that were on that point then this could be the ultimate intel ribbon here look at this oh my god there's so many oh god it's not a ranger is it oh it's a centric career god i hate those things medic medic oh my god look at all those enemies there does this count does this count as spots okay right game one's over we didn't get a full game i think we made a fair bit of progress there okay so that's my current progress there 14 kills that round fair enough intel ribbons two out three need one more of those and objectives captured i only got two i'm not ptfo very well am i okay manifest we should be able to capture a couple points dead easy here so we'll get a1 and a2 at least that'll be two objectives in the bag helicopter those transport vehicles are still pretty excuse me tank that's not acceptable dude that was rude you just barged me out of the way bro i got it dude i've got to capture the objectives as well what there's just an invisible nothing there look at that that's literally stopping me from go what is it there's just some there's something invisible on the ground there that just stops you it's not real look that's i'm holding w what the hell should i just yolo to d1 and see what happens look at these lads lads what you doing i need to go capture the d come on pokeball yes oh look there's a balti i'm gonna use my wall hacks blow that up there was a guy here it is kind of hard to see you know when you've got the wall hacks on it's a bit counter-intuitive i suppose but you won't want them to be like super op would you these little guys here come on i need the points for my unlock guys thank you for letting me kept the point back can you get tornadoes on this map you can can't you like the wind is blowing pretty hard what the rocket thank you angel there's someone here yes christian love that thank you okay well there's another one in the bag where'd you go now the old jump peak should i just get another intel ribbon then maybe hang on what the what the condo the american forces are looking for mckay oh he's fine i think i've got enough kills now though now we're losing b1 again unacceptable what the hell was that good i think that was a jet just flying into the ground dog ranger go over there stay there let me pet you you just hold use look at this oh it's adorable nice little ranger i like that animation it's good gives me jurassic park vibes this area does what there's like a dilophosaurus in there could be you never know what oh my god is it gone i think it's good that was the fastest lap be that i've ever seen i don't think i've ever seen one go faster than that it was like rocket powered or something oh look at this that's new isn't it i think i think that's there don't you dare kill me with a 50ml don't you dare angel be careful look i think i've just got to capture the objectives now that should be it it's easier said than done isn't it capture this back nice got air support there get away from me boris okay i'm sure there was another one here yeah look crawling easy target very easy objective captured love that look at this what is going down here panda's dead yeah we've got enemies over here that was weird my gun like fired at a different rate then that was strange did you guys pick that up in the video and the audio i'm going to wait for this angel because i know they're going to res me angel does it again don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes words to live by are they dead okay captured it very good objective ribbon love that weekly mission yes i think we got it there it is the veiled threat headgear okay i'm gonna actually switch and play as rao because i just never play as well before i do that though i'm just gonna go at the top and see if i can take out these guys up here how did you not kill me i will never know oh come on come on come on you want you want this you want this sorry you want this god get rid of that turret everything's fine sector clear good okay so how do i actually like put this on headgear oh yeah you can do it separately can't you there we go look watch out we got a badass over here what is this one looks like a gi joe character i don't think i've even looked at these before anyways with the veiled threat now they're an actual real soldier that kind of looks cool okay how do i play israel i have to like i have to hack things i've never i've never understood this character it's not very good really it was a dozer up there even though they buffed it didn't they pretty sure they both did recently i can hack people as well which is weird like hack their technology on them okay so they have wow they've really increased the range on that is that too far away oh they jumped out look i mean that's easy pickings for the score what's my password damn it you move backwards it doesn't disable the movement does it just the guns right whoa you took the body that's not a hit i'm sorry you're gonna get hacked you've been hacked now what they got a little frazzle on him are they jumped out where'd you go ah i'm gonna hack you you've been hacked i think that should put a pulse out or something i don't know it's just not a very well designed specialist is it it's just weird oh hello ralph's head is uh in an unfortunate position there wait if i hack this does that turn it into one of my people drone i'm gonna get hacked ruined now what i'll just shoot it i guess yeah boom faulty let's get it good to see one again why not here i don't know why i've not got the cannon on for some reason i really should have put it on although that minigun seems to be better than it used to be anyway i think the balti will get this ramp look at that oh that's on the knife edge come on come on it's slow progress there's a guy right here and they're dead and we're back up come on i don't know what's next though oh sundance i can't aim down any further than that it's not it's not working guys i dream of putting the the balti on the ship it's over i'm sorry can i actually take this point how did you know i was there boris no i'm spied now forever oh god okay right yeah spider even more cool cool cool cool cool cool cool you're gonna get hacked is that being soft it is this is being soft and bang it barely damages it though does it of course now with rao he's got hate's old passive so when people shoot me i spot them anyway so maybe like rao was the best choice for this anyway they changed it didn't they i've nearly got the win there's someone in the old golf ball there look he destroyed it ow that's actually really useful there so it took literally a game and a half or less than that really like i would say one full game you could do this if you're lucky with the caps that was good we get number one squad number one squad let's go there's me new gun on the block it looks so cool it actually looks like a soldier boom look at that i'm ready if you want rao is ready if if
