the ram seven is absolute filth in war zone check this out playing true as with study and westy enemy team outside crack one down one and we're gonna push that feeling confident throughout the centex start the stone get the tag go on the right gets beamed ruin that's one team wipe now pop this uav another team dead ahead of us i'm gonna pick the head glitch here beam down down last guy cracked one magazine that was and i throw the nade get the finish in the double kill feels good man the ram seven i think it's actually eclipsed the a max for me as my favorite gun in warzone now a lot of people don't like the ram seven because it's got this really aggressive up and to the left recall check this out so this is with no recoil control and as you can see pretty nasty paul to the left there but not many people practice with this and it's actually quite easy to counter all you've got to do after that like 8th or 9th bullet you're pulling down and then you just pull down and to the right and as you can see there's a really nice grouping there compared to the original now this is a lot easier to do on a mouse than it is on controller pulling down until the eighth and ninth bullet and then you start to pull diagonal down and you can get a really tight cluster on controller yeah it's tricky on pc it's a doddle because of the rate of fire and the damage you can drop people so fast especially when you mount the build for the ram 7 hasn't really changed over the last couple months and neither has the gun but because of everything else that's happened in the game with the other guns the rebalancing fixing the attachments the amax being nerfed a little bit the ram 7 has slowly but surely crept its way up and the ttk is incredibly competitive and it can beat a lot of other guns in the game if you want to run it medium to long range or you put that three times on it if you want to run it close it's still very good and you can go the hollow red dot whatever you want now the gameplay i'm going to show you today is one of my personal best in terms of the number of kills and just how action-packed it was and i was using the ram seven i've just showed you with that vlk scope and i was engaging it close mid and long range just proving how versatile it is and pairing it with the zrg sniper rifle for some nice headshots i think is super powerful right now so before we get into the action i have to say a big thank you to today's sponsors nvidia and alienware they sent over an alienware aw2521h monitor for me to test out it's an absolute beast and that's what we'll be playing on in this match this monitor has a 360hz refresh rate 1080p ips panel a true 1ms greater grey response time and ultra low motion blur tech which means it's exceedingly smooth to play on without sacrificing color accuracy or viewing angles it's definitely designed for competitive play and you feel more connected to the monitor in your mouse movements and what you're seeing on the screen this is also boosted by technologies like g-sync and nvidia reflex there are plenty of games that support reflex now such as apex and valrant but it is awesome to have it in a game that i play regularly like warzone higher frame rates equals lower system latency and nvidia reflex ensures that you get the lowest latency possible for a responsive gameplay experience and faster reaction times additionally warzone also supports dlss which uses ai to boost your frames per second if you'd like to learn more about this monitor there's a link down in the description below with that said let's jump into the action now i've just picked up my loadout and we're about to go on a tear if you enjoy the video leave a like and a comment below do you think the ram 7 is the best gun in the game now i
