ground let's do a bit of sniping you see yes love it excited tank over there oh there's a bomber there look at that started copying me is that okay maybe i'm aiming a bit ruined i mean we've taken the map back to be fair i didn't see that happening support player up on the bridge trying to hammer me there they're trying to send people around here aren't they another i'm sure there was a medic there right how are they dead are they all dead did you kill them oh my god there's so many enemies around here can i go up here is this chill look at the minibar there's people right underneath me all right well unfortunately the way that the ticket system in bf1 works it means that we're not gonna win this one although if it was old-school battlefield style we would have easily won it you know the way bf5 works with the majority flag concept yeah bf1 didn't have that also counts up to a thousand as well that's good game i think we'll play another one albion albion's the one isn't it come on wing damage yes oh that guy's a good pilot well that bomber is going to get us oh no no no no no the music oh my god he's falling out of the sky for an epic start to the game i love this it's awesome yes this is my jam world war one jam right here guys this is war this is true battle on a field they should call this game battlefield it's not like a really good name for a game like this isn't it really i don't know why they didn't go with that oh they're up for d yes love that that's in the sweet spot there isn't it for the good bear they are all over this d point is there a medic there somebody was there what's that what the that's flying solo down to the ground what happened with that tree there why did that tree fall down smoke monster from lost maybe you never know what the what happened to him have i been spied here i don't really know how i'm alive but yeah it's it's whatever at this point i'm gonna stay here see if someone goes with the res uh it's fine it's fine grenade there oh my god he's running at me there's another grenade get out give me this what's this lewis gun there's no ammo in it guys that's a revolver wait i can't get much that's not that's the more no i don't how do i get off this that was just a comedy of errors right there it's fine it's fine we'll deal with it like this boat that's where i want to be on the boat oh no there's an enemy boat how do i oh yeah put me in coach okay right he's jumped up uh enemy vote enemy vote yes ah damn it nice shot dude not sure how you killed me but physics i guess a sentry kit yes army you picked the wrong sentries to fire i'm afraid you picked the wrong sentry to fire at yes oh right where do we go it's all i've got in it i just have this giant machine gun i think is snipers i can't get over there i'm slow i need a boat it's more accurate the longer you fire it so technically i could kill that person i'm not going there across the bridge man to war god imagine trying to swim across a small body of war like this in a suit of freaking armor imagine that but it's not possible surely surely that's just impossible but then again we do have suspension of disbelief and this is a video game and it's fun oh bombs a couple snipers back here we'll go get them that was really really mean you've not done that oh that's the tank hunter isn't it i don't really want to deal with that guy surprise it's me the juggernaut push those enemies around here i can hear them they over there gosh i don't know where they are guys hey hey hey stop it oh oh he's clinton he's going to make okay now i need heels desperately there's no medics there's actually no we've been medics down the juggernauts dead oh that's fun oh in the head yes heavy bomber taking a few hits perform 400 vehicle damage using k bullets i've not done that already and it's gone beautiful did the pilot jump out as well someone's glimpsing me on it no don't pick that anymore it's got really uh like misty all of a sudden yes they've got quite a nice position on this here don't they i reckon we can push up though yeah it's gone very foggy feels good man getting those sniper headshots where they just walk into it i put a cheeky player up here nope can't get it there dice what about round here there's a guy here this one behind me as well medic i'm in trouble there i gotta fall back i'm gonna catch a bullet all night oh god i'm so dead it's a bloody firing squad up there look at that one two three four that's an entire squad didn't stand a chance i'm gonna jump in this bad boy the lewis gun completely ineffective oh you just bombed the crap out of that that was sick we capture this oh i'm gonna use the coaster bed why not is it any good i don't remember at all all i know is that you're a really easy target right how do you even i don't remember how to use this at all do you thank you uh does that work oh no it's gone already pathetic see a little dude down here on the mini map oh thank you for going prone i appreciate that we are losing objectives that's good well i fear we may lose this one guys they pushed us too hard we just weren't world war one enough you know we can't beat world war one every day of the week as much as you'd like to be what the friendly no i won that kill dice please don't don't shoot me don't shoot me oh come on dude i said don't shoot me he go ahead and shot me look it kind of reminds me of how voy a bit this map now the firestorm out may she rest in peace 80 damage nice couldn't quite see the guy on that one kind of went off to the side didn't it there's a mountain in the way all that drag shot i love it love that energy miss that one though one more bullet this is a battle for the ages this one [Laughter] sniper versus miller medics in the shack sniper's outside who wins sniper wins [Applause] i'm dice there we go that's better i'm sure like two of those bullets should have been hits we've got a good old snipe off on our hands here damn it oh they're up in that little bunker there look at that nope oh i'm gonna be pushed now aren't i he's right here oh that was dirty well as i suspected we are gonna lose this one but it was close and i enjoyed it it was good fun are they in there yep 50 damage no no no no no i don't think so [ __ ] bayonet killed on my watch there's people everywhere let me get one last sniper kill before the round's over and there
