I don't know if you guys knew this but you can unlock a cricket back in ba5 I don't see this that often because to unlock this you have to complete some quite annoying challenges in one of the war stories but because I'm a bit of a masochist I decided to unlock it myself so we're going to take it in to multiplayer and see what damage we can do enjoy mate found our first victim little sniper got the Christmas helmet on we're at played nice plane I think it's time your sniping days are over time a key component of cricket bat only is smoke grenade you've got to throw as many as you can and
