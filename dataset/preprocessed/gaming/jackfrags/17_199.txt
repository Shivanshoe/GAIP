elden ring is awesome i've been playing this for the last few days in the closed network test on playstation 5. and we're going to be looking at some highlights here i've left out all of the story cut scenes and moments because i don't want to spoil that for anyone that might want to play this themselves when it eventually comes out so we'll be taking on a few bosses mini boss is also the main boss of the area in the closed network test as well if you're watching this video you may already know what elden ring is but if you didn't it's a game by from software they're famous for demon souls dark souls games bloodborne sakiro and their latest project is this elden ring it's taking that dark souls formula and making it open world so you dropped into a massive map and this is only a portion of the world that you'll see in this video and then you're free to explore really go around on foot you can sprint you can jump you can also summon a steed ride around on horseback for a bit get you around faster from a to b and you can fight while on the horse there's some really awesome combat opportunities here especially when fighting the bigger enemies for example a dragon it's pretty awesome using a sword using a bow and arrow whatever it is it's incredibly cinematic when you start the game you can pick between five different classes or archetypes you've got the warrior the enchanted knight the prophet the champion and the bloody wolf i went with the bloody wolf just because i think they look the coolest and they're all about swords and shields and you can also two-hand that sword putting out some massive damage you're not locked into that archetype though and it really just defines your starting gear and stats for example vigor strength mind intelligence dexterity and then you can level those stats up at sites of grace throughout the game using rooms that you've either collected from runestones or from enemies that you've defeated but if you die you'll lose all of the rooms that you haven't spent but you do have one opportunity to go back and collect them but if you die again while you're trying to retrieve them you'll lose those forever i wanted to show a bit of a mix of gameplay in this one so this is typically what the open world gameplay looks like you can just roam around discover things you can fight mobs that might be at campsites or roaming around the world could be lesser mobs that are a bit of a walk over but you'll also be fighting harder enemies and there are certain areas of the map of course where you'll find foes or mini bosses and if you beat them typically you'll get a better upgrade for your character there is a main quest as well and you see here we've got this gold wispy stuff in the air if you're lost and you don't know how to progress that will guide you towards the main missions in a way but this is a site of grace and these can be used as fast travel points but as i just mentioned you can also level up and adjust your stats here you can mix different things in your flasks to create certain effects you can modify the ashes of war on your weapons and gear and also memorize spells so in here myself and tommy you can't play co-op i think it's up to four players we just did a bit of exploring and we found a cave there are caves or dungeons scattered around everywhere you go down and through the mist and inside you'll find all sorts of horrible monstrums and enemies to fight the combat itself if you've played any of the souls games you'll feel right at home here so you've got your stamina you've got block parry roll light attack heavy attack you've also got ranged weapons and now you can jump too and with that jump you can do jump attacks and they cause a lot of stagger effect or stagger damage to enemies and that will give you an opportunity to deal a ton of damage incredibly useful versus some of the bosses but the jump also enables some extra exploration opportunities that we haven't really had before in these type of games so it's definitely a welcome feature for me stealth as well it's an option crouching around staying in the long grass and weeds enemies won't be able to detect you as easily and you'll have the opportunity to get those big stealth attacks in i found this giant enemy crab look at its massive claws just down on the beach here some of the designs of the creatures are fantastic but i had to take out that because i can't have that existing i'm sorry even it's spawn they've got to go too i mean i've not played many of the souls games i've dabbled in most of them here and there the one that i played the most was actually demon souls on the playstation 3 i managed to finish that and also i played the remake of that a little bit but it's just cool to get into it again and yes it's incredibly punishing and sometimes it can be frustrating but that's the whole point isn't it you try and beat these creatures that have unpredictable vicious attack cycles and patterns and you go again and again and again and eventually you do beat them it feels good you get that reward you move on to the next one or you continue going through the story it's just a big sense of satisfaction there also there are now stakes in the ground which act as respawn points and these are dotted around the world if you die you can respawn at a stake if there was one nearby or you can choose to respawn at the last site of grace that you visited but these stakes just allow you to get back into the action quicker i think that's the whole point of it rather than respawning at a camp that's miles away i feel like they've put these next to those big boss fights to alleviate some of that frustration when you might die and then you've just got a massive run to get back to where you were and collect your souls or your runes and then have another go at the boss which you might die to instantly so i appreciate the fact that those stakes are there now the open world element too because there's a bit of exploration now it makes it more interesting for me like i just found this random door at the bottom of a chasm which was filled with jellyfish and inside there's a little dungeon with a boss and there were these horrible stone creatures in here it's called merc water catacombs there were some traps on the floor too where if you stood on a certain area fire arrows would come flying towards you and if you don't react quick enough you don't block that you can end up taking a lot of damage but this was the boss in here the grave warden they look like a gladiator quite vicious to fight i did use one of my ashes here though you see that ghost thing there that's the noble sorcerer and they act as a great distraction if you need the enemy to take some aggro or get off your case for a sec while you heal you can put that up they also do a bit of damage too managed to finish him off there with a couple of light attacks everyone say goodbye to the grey warden now what you're about to see is the first what i would consider big boss of the game or as they call it in this game a great foe and i presume that the closed network test is the starting area of the game they'll probably be a bit more of an introduction but this was the first major boss that i thought as i'm trying to push towards and get into the castle this guy is called marjit the fel omen it took me quite a few attempts to beat this dude now originally i was using the sorcerer ashes which you just saw that old man who would do some ranged attacks but against him he was just pathetic very weak didn't really do much damage not a great distraction so i changed i left the area did a few upgrades did a few dungeons and came back with the lone wolf ashes and these spawn three walls or dire walls that will attack him and they do a bit of chip damage more importantly it's a big distraction so it lets me get behind him do some of those jump attacks get a lot of stagger damage in enabled me to eventually take this dude out right at the end of the fight here i wasn't gonna die quick heal and then we'll get back into the fight yeah annoying as hell to fight this guy i'm sure if you're a veteran souls player this will be a donald for you but for me many attempts were had but feels good man when you finally get that kill and then we can push up towards the castle i included this bit here just because it looks so damn awesome and gothic there is more after this though but don't want to spoil it don't want to drag the video out too long i had a blast with eldon ring with a closed network test and i'll definitely be playing it some more in the future with that said let me guys know what you think down in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one sorry i forgot to add this when i got to the top of the castle i was attacked by a giant eagle with daggers on its talons i've never seen anything more horrific than that right i'm off bye
