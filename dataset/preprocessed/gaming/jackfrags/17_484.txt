hi guys hope you're all doing well today just got a bit of a short video for you but i did feel quite passionate about this and i think that time is a big factor here so i wanted to get this out and talk about it as quick as possible as you may know warzone season 1 released yesterday new rebirth match 30 cold war guns added into the game skins operators battle pass but it also introduced one of the worst bugs that i've seen in the game and it lets you go invisible and invincible to most things in the game and the problem with this is that it's incredibly easy to replicate so of course people want to pad their stats they want wins on the leaderboards they just want to troll have fun whatever almost every single match that i've played this morning has had someone doing this glitch and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible it's incredibly easy to do i'm not going to show you how to do it but it involves the new helicopter with the guns on the side and those are in every single game mode now so every match someone is doing this and ultimately most of the time they're winning the game so if you come across someone that's doing this you can't kill them with bullets the only ways that you can kill them i think are running them over in a vehicle they're in a vehicle and you blow it up that will kill them molotovs and gas grenades and that's it as far as i know that's the only thing that can actually kill people doing this and even then you're gonna get lucky because it's someone who is invisible and they can just sit in a corner and shoot you very easily without you even knowing where it's coming from so the chances of you beating someone doing this are incredibly low so really i'm calling on infinity ward and raven whoever it is that's making this game now warzone and updating it please get a hotfix out for this as soon as possible ideally if you can today before the weekend do a server-side patch or hotfix disable helicopters whatever you can do because i'm sure that none of us want a situation where this goes on for a week or something because it really is ruining the game it's a game breaking bug that's easy to achieve and it's controlling the online conversation right now it's not hey look at this cool new map and look at these new guns it's just oh have you seen the invisible glitch i hope that they're responsive with this because the last couple months or so with the amount of juggernauts in the game the glitch where you could replicate the juggernauts that kind of stuff just seemed like it went on for ages so i do think that they need to be more reactive with this stuff and i think that getting this out there getting visibility on it talking about it will ensure that it's fixed quickly as far as what you can do well if you come across this in a game report the player at the end of the match because let's be honest it's intentional cheating at this point yeah maybe the first person that discovered this it was an accident but now that everyone knows how to do it there's tutorials online and everything like that so it's most likely intentional if this is happening in a game that you're in so report anyone that's doing it also something else you can do at the start of the game if you feel like if you're in a squad or solo you can actually try and get to the helicopters first and just crash them go high in the sky or line them up with a building jump out destroy them because then there's no way to do this glitch so there we go hopefully it gets sorted out as soon as possible thanks for watching guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
