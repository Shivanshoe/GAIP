[Music] welcome back to part two of dying light 2. yesterday we played for about four hours and made some good progress through the starting area of the game whilst there was a lot of exposition and cutscenes i've been told that from this point on the game really opens up so i'm looking forward to jumping back in today unlocking more abilities and carrying on with the main quest our first port of call is to meet with hackon on a rooftop up ahead also today i have to say a big thanks to nvidia 4 sponsoring we'll be playing here using geforce now which is nvidia's game streaming service using the new 1440p 120fps setting so effectively i'm connecting to a pc in the cloud using an rtx 3080 and playing remotely on my own steam account i can also enable ray tracing and other fancy graphics settings in the menu like dlss the great thing about this is that if i had a really old pc or laptop android app ios fire safari or macbook for example i could use geforce now to play modern games like this without needing to buy a crazy high spec pc geforce now has three tiers available the first is the free tier which is running 1080p 60fps and that will give you one hour long sessions but you can just log out and log back in the priority tier which is paid and that's 1080p 60fps but that's on an rtx 2080s that will give you like ray tracing and dlss and six hour long sessions and then the 3080 tier which is what i'm using today enabling 1440p 120 fps on an rtx 3080 with eight hour long sessions new games are added every thursday and if you want to try it out for yourself there's a link down in the description below with that said if you enjoyed the video leave a like let's boot up now and get back into the gameplay right this is going to be good welcome guys we are continuing hacking i think is over on that roof somewhere we starting off with a bit of physics there as well i didn't expect that [Music] love a bit of physics it was really half life too you know it started

right i know a guy who trades stolen goods and other [ __ ] he gets from thieves offense part-time fence full-time scammer and heartless one too he's got half the city after him for death right now if anyone in vilador is full enough to buy a peacekeeper weapon it would be him what's his name hubert kabatos that's a good name also known as half-ass hubie half-assed he sets up my windmill and waits for customers probably selling booze and weed to the pks if you want to find the lazarus talk with hubie i'll chase down some other leads okay let's keep in touch i mean he sounds like a bit of a character but i want to get these knuckles don't i these brass knuckles how far away is that 130 meters [Music] um i realized as well that in the stream yesterday in part one i did actually get the ability to like do an action landing or a soft landing so if i fall from a big height i can roll or just give myself a little cheeky little buffer so i don't take damage that's got to be too high up

i think it's a human i don't think it's a face lazarus yeah i used to belong to lucas the late pk commander don't try to tell me you don't know who lucas is well then i won't know anything about the lazarus are you kidding me even if i'd been offered those brass knuckles i would have refused i'm not an idiot that weapon is way too hot how do you know the lazarus is a set of brass knuckles how did you know that lazarus is a set of brass exactly he's lying come on everyone knew about lucas's little love glove love glove i don't like that come on anyone thought i had them love gloves which is [ __ ] but someone tried to sell it to you right i told you i okay fine maybe someone did but i can't say who client confidentially tell me or her name is maya i met her in the tenement building at meet packing square near the old bush pack and square but i don't know anything else leave me alone it overlooks some army barracks or some [ __ ] all right i can find that hubert please stop lying to me ooby i know you're lying hey heck on hubert said someone tried to sell him the lazarus do you know amaya no strange because i thought i knew all the women here i'm ready to meet you very funny parking square it's a [ __ ] up place throw some barracks there the army set up at 23 when [ __ ] went south she supposed to be in one of the buildings that overlooked them okay stay in touch bro can i open this [Music] oh baby maybe not maybe not now no that's pain 204 you gotta go look for maya and my pack and square they go there's a roly-poly so i don't take damage anymore when i drop i imagine if i dropped from like a really big height i'd end up dying though but you know i'm not invincible out here that's all i'm saying i did actually watch a couple of guides as well about which of the best upgrades to get because i don't want to waste my points you know because as i said at the start apparently after that bit that we just played yesterday those first four hours the game really starts to pick up pace and open up a bit get a bit more interesting what's that then just loot why can i hear dogs oh hello i wanted to try this molotov [Applause] hit me oh okay that's interesting he was charred parkour parkour i'm going to try and say that as little as possible today look at that that's nice man bloody bludgeon or something let's burn to a crisp do you like dags that's a lockpick as well roly-poly what's wrong with the roly-poly everyone says that that's what we call them in the uk it's what we're taught when we little kids ah close medic cap common headwear i never look around for the opportunistic weapons like i'm just detected i'm too smooth night activity oh that one's gotta hurt i presume that they're on the roof yeah i enjoyed this yesterday but lots of cutscenes you know maybe it is in the building on the balcony all right where's mayor then on maya [Music] we've only just started re-backs you haven't missed much so far uh you may have missed the sponsored bit at the start we're actually playing this on geforce now today which means i'm live streaming it from a computer in europe somewhere which is kind of cool like this isn't being played natively on my pc this is actually being streamed from a server [Music] what is going on downstairs [Music] i mean it sounds like they're having a blast down a there indeed where are the stairs [Music] it doesn't look like the stairs there [Music] i was expecting to land on the little ridge there hang on wait a second it's giving me goosebumps i was giving you goosebumps did i just miss the stairs maybe i did have another look what are you doing sir sir here he's here can you take it i just got robbed i actually just got robbed then [Music] are they above me or maybe they're above me yes okay hold on let me just check this container go use that are there little kids hey kids um i'm looking for a woman named maya it was so funny maya ain't a grown-up she's just a plain old girl what you were the one trying to sell a pk weapon to hubert yeah but the jerk didn't want it got all freaked out and chased me away whoa how did you get a hold of a peacekeeper weapon we all found it was wandering around with these punks and ran across a corpse happens a lot he was totally dead we searched him and i take the brass husa watsits cause i figured someone would pay a pretty penny for him give it to me now maya i need that weapon i want the brass knuckles you expect me to just hand that brass who's he what's it over are you nuts the who's he what's it's real name is the lazarus and it belonged to an important pk we might have a war if i don't return it he could help us find a murderer okay i'll give you this stupid thing 500 i don't have 500. that's a lot of money kid of course it is life's damn expensive i have to buy water and a marker for my brother he's turning 12 soon you know i can give you ten and that's my last offer deal nobody wanted to buy it anyway i mean 500 to 10 like that's i think you just got robbed lately although you robbed it anyway right so god this world must suck to be a child in it it's a megalodon i have the lazarus cool get your ass to ato with it it'll make the perfect birthday present for him though i have no idea when that prick was born i'll be near metro station okay i will come and see you oh it's getting night time careful what voice [Music] yeah now that i'm starting to learn the parkour system a bit it's a lot more fun [Music] i think i could make that jump what about this one although there's a howler down there so not a great idea i'm gonna go down here instead i must ruin myself then [Music] why are all these trees growing on rooftops by the way that's a proper tree isn't it that's unusual it's not a weed [Music] [Applause] [Music] first time they've done that [Music] i am the matrix i watched that the other night the new matrix movies are on vod now [Music] oh what do you guys think of it have you seen to do whatever he it him to do okay we're back here i'm gonna give this guy the knuckle dusters back my lady [Music] what's going on in here has returned i hope not empty-handed i found the lazarus i was on the top damned i was right that you could open doors we couldn't where's the [ __ ] who adam in meat packing square you didn't let him go did you that could have been the murderer a girl had him she's 10 or something she didn't kill him just looted the corpse what's the tattoo it looks like a constellation on your arm those are ranked tattoos when we ran low on resources tattoos eventually replaced medals they show our hierarchy like in prison prison or military is all the same there's always a pecking order i did what you wanted it's your turn get me to the center opening the tunnel to the central loop is beyond my pay grade pilgrim command wants me to find the killer adam you promised cool down pilgrim i keep my promises simmer down first take this token of gratitude oh is that a new weapon vader i have to get to the center get it you're looking for someone right i want to go to the central loop too my wife and kids are there and i can't protect them when i'm stuck here the tunnel will open when i find the killer is that clear you can help me or you can wait until i find him myself i see traces of blood on the lazarus's blades lucas managed to wound his killer before he died bastard's got to have a nasty gash nasty ghost if you find him you'll not only help me you'll be helping yourself okay do you have any suspects the commander was murdered in the bazaar there had to be someone from there i'll try to find lucas's killer splendid that's your ticket to the center head back to the bazaar is there anything else i should know before i go yes as a matter of fact oh nda ndh word of this cannot get out sounds serious whoever killed lucas took a little trophy carved his tattoo right out of his bloody arm they cut into his corpse that is seriously [ __ ] up yeah seriously men found out lucas was desecrated like that they'd lose their [ __ ] and it would be total war i'm telling you this because if you find that little trophy then you found the sick [ __ ] who killed lucas got it i'll head out right now um he's got a cool office what did i think of the matrix um the whole like fourth wall bit in the first half of the movie is really difficult to like overcome i don't want to spoil the plot but there's a lot of that going on worried about me are you of course i have high hopes for you aiden meet me outside uh it didn't really have the grittiness of the first movie either there were some cool action bits in it but um i just felt like it was a bit unnecessary peter wants me to find lucas's murderer only then will he help me get to the center not doing his dirty work well that's no surprise i'd never watch it again with the bizarre figures pk and the bazaar really hate each other only two people matter at the bazaar one is that overblown preacher carl i know that who else is there sophie his right hand she has a way with the bazaar's more rebellious souls helps him keep control there's also dodger a local gangster he knows what's going on and about the bandits led by joe but they're afraid of the pk okay i'll talk to sophie and you look into carl unless do you prefer the girl sophie she's not really my type you know and headstrong she's he just loves women she can't help like just always always talking about the women i thought he has a wife or a second wife or a third wife he's got so many wives or he says that he has i don't know i don't know what's real anymore now i'm gonna have a look at this new weapon that i got it was um it was a blue axe wasn't it this one the chopper oh baby check me out it's got mods on it as well oh could i modify it now oh this one modify spark oh that's in it already is it no it isn't i've got the shaft as well i don't think i've got anything to put in the shaft [Music] okay find the gap i'm gonna sell all my valuables to you oh wow this guy's got purple weapons the damage isn't really that high though so where's the craft lad he's over here weapon mods shaft tip critical hit chance grip buy that buy that i hope you purchase this do you proud they will do me proud thank you very much and then i'm gonna modify this put that in the shaft there we go i think we've upgraded it a little bit there what's the point putting the charm on it i don't think it changes the stats does it hello cisco the menu reminds me of assassin's creed valhalla um yeah a little bit someone just said fling is really good though so i don't know i feel like maybe i should maybe i should get it change that one round at the top i'll put it on a different weapon [Music] i'm gonna put it on this one modify oh there's already electric on it though can i remove it i can't remove it can i no remove delete nevermind save that for another weapon he's responsible for the black monday bombings and the death of two million people cool two million that's a lot of people damn [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] can i not fast travel there how do i fast travel guys do i have to actually be like inside the hood at night get back inside the terminal quick you better stop talking to me i'm gonna go on the roof it'll be fine what's up nicholas i've got some decoys now too and uh a pot of meat which i think i can use as bait that'll be interesting [Music] oh my god they just love getting in these little vents don't they i was done ladies you haven't equipped the gloves that you looted i don't think they were better than what i had though right oh no they were totally thank you cheers for the heads-up chat what would i do without you what's that boulder call it okay is that the one that was orange before what pretty sure there's no fast travel i thought there was maybe they just save houses then pilgrim will you teach me some of your parkour moves no in that dressing gown ow you get changed maybe and then we'll have a chat what's a blip blop how you doing what a great name flip flop open up hey who the [ __ ] are you you know who i am easy chief he ain't pk how do you know they're creeping around here all the time he's that outsider outsider the pilgrim he's from outside the walls well [ __ ] me i don't know what brings you here but watch your back pilgrim and stay away from the pk's they ain't no one's friends there is fast travel but you have to unlock the metro stations thank you this time with a biomarker uh mocha appreciate that jack is their co-op yeah there is to bring your own so he can introduce himself what a nice change from wanting to hang me [Music] and remember humanity created a civilization that turned out to be a colossus on clay legs we cannot make the same mistakes he didn't want to he had to you were a threat to everyone of course do not listen to the ideologies preached by fools calling for reconstruction there will be no rebuilding why he's dressed like a medieval night or something or a temple look at that who would have thought a pilgrim in the bazaar welcome yeah i'm still alive despite your best efforts it's clear to me you're holding a grudge but if you were in my shoes you would understand we are responsible for the safety of our community and we treat this seriously looks like robbie downey jr we did what we did i hope you can forgive us oh yeah i'm iron man so pray tell what's it like in the outside world these days sucks dude it really sucks bad and getting worse settlements are shrinking in size and number i'm afraid soon there will be nowhere else to go doesn't surprise me son humanity must reach the bottom in order to rise again and this is why we are here any more news not really he just wants the gospel he wants the team more about your people i'm not gonna give in we are called the people of the bazaar simply because of where we live but who we are truly are free people free from lies free from money free from religion wars politics and the dark cloud that has blanketed the earth that sounds great too good to be true in fact oh we have our challenges water is scarce for example but with courage and patience we will someday create a paradise well you seem almost thankful for the collapse of civilization it was as tragic as it was inevitable consumerism belief in the almighty dollar led to this catastrophe so we here strive not to make the same mistake twice it would be a crime communism a new order based on social bonds yeah on family and community a society where people support each other and adhere to justice no need for the police military or false authorities to shoot those they are meant to protect we have a place for everyone but let's get back to your stories [Music] is gossip all you want from me carl no but you came from outside and you're walking around my flock so to set things straight i need to know if you're a sheep or a wolf a wolf what are you then you better watch out you better watch out you better watch out you better watch out a wolf you better watch out i'm relieved then the true wolf doesn't have to announce he's a wolf you know what i think it's time i said things straight too i'm looking for sophie are you and why pray tell i need to ask her about lucas's death oh why would a pilgrim care about pk business what's in it for you let's say a man's death should be another man's concern isn't that what separates us from the infected i guess you have a point lucas's death is our concern as well but mainly because we are the prime suspects i have never hidden my views on the peacekeeper i don't have the grapple hook yet claim or not because of people like them greedy power-hungry fascists building the new reality based on the old values would not be wise to say the least of course according to the pk such claims automatically make me and all of us potential killers so the sooner lucas's murderer is found the better for us hmm go that way you'll see a giant of a man herman sophie's bodyguard i'm a monster he was in for he was in yesterday just to be clear i'd be surprised if she knew anything about it sophie is a fighter not an assassin yeah thanks for the heads up i'll see you around carl i don't like this guy uh ricky b is this running on geforce now 3080 series or pr uh we're on the 3080 uh i think i can bring up the overlay don't stay out at night that's when the monster there you go look top right 120 fps 40p i hear you've been to the outlands while you're there listen i'm going to go speak to herman okay [Music] sophie can we talk tom is not that big let him talk you're saying hi my name is aiden you're that pilgrim that came to town recently you're sure well informed don't have much of a choice i'm in charge of safety here besides yesterday you made quite an entrance i'm looking for a job would you happen to know of any hmm people here say you can be useful i'd rather see for myself how about a small errand first i'll do it what are you proposing go to one of the craft masters alberto or vincenzo both know the location of the purest crystals i need some for a certain transaction fine i'll go talk to one of those craft masters they should be at the bazaar do well and we can think about giving you bigger jobs okay uh chill cat we're playing on the server at the moment on geforce now so this is i'm playing on my pc but i'm playing on a stream on my pc so you guys are watching a stream of a stream does that make sense it's very purple [Music] back in the day i had a huge always spread dust again a workshop that is a workshop so where is it you're not in one now alberto welcome she says you know where they can find some crystals [Music] don't think this that guy on the left looks like tom holland i don't think it does already sent one of their [ __ ] who that fellow sophie's brother what was the asshole's name barney the asshole's names barney the dinosaur the same question about a dark zone with crystals yeah that's news to me so where is that dark zone it's a hundred a hundred and twenty uh hundred and that can i tell him oh please a hundred meters from the metro there's a big screen looks a bit like tom holland and a windmill on the other side of the street thanks yeah for real it's a stream of a stream streamception it's what's going on he's beginning to believe in the stream section uh tactical potato will you make a vid on crossfire x yeah yeah totally thank you i'm really interested in that sophie come here wow come here what did you find i know the location but

he's tatted answer me barney damn so that's why he's gone offline he's looking for the crystals on his own and throwing a wrench in the works yet again this isn't the first time i gather no he's always trying to prove himself last time he got wounded wasn't that long ago either a [ __ ] kid i'll kill him i'll just kill him [Music] why blame yourself we all make our own beds listen you said it yourself you're new here so you don't know much i'm responsible for security here and he's my brother i promised i'd look after him he promised promised who never mind i'll kick barney's ass when he gets back [Music] uh ripper there is co-op you've got four player co-op on this game how'd barney get wounded he didn't want to tell me my guess is that the pk's got a hold of him your brother keeps secrets from you that's none of your business barney answer me damn it all to hell if he went to a dark zone in his condition he's a connor i can try to track him down you i've been in the dark zone before the gre hospital division st joseph hospital really if you save him you won't regret it go at once you have to find him before dawn i'll do my best imagine if the big lad turns into a zombie it's gonna be a horrific zombie in months because of this ridiculous blockade of the center parkour so what should we get then guys firm grip increase the height which you land from okay maybe that's good then although this i'm gonna spread it out i'm gonna spread it out we are at nighttime now aren't we should be all right should be sticking to the rooftops really oh there'll be a chase a bear oh

don't want to pirate it you know i just i'm not about that if it was available in the uk i'd just buy it but i don't think you can get it yet actually that's it they gone yeah he's all messed up there's some air your sister mentioned you're stubborn she didn't say you were an idiot hey i should beat you down for that here take your radio we're leaving no bernie we gotta find birdie who he lured away the infected when they were about to get me down there if not for him i'd have ended up like kojak you're in no condition to look for anyone he's just a kid man i promised his old lady i'd bring him back understand he drew those bastards to himself you get it so i could grab the crystals for the bazaar i have to find him you're in no condition to search for anyone barney i'm not going back without him [Music] where can i find him he was on the ground floor when those [ __ ] surrounded me they ran out after him through the side door okay you stay here and wait for my signal i'll find your friend and then come back for you got it hurry okay uh gingerbread thank you for the five haven't picked up this game yet is it worth it i love the first game um i didn't play the first game i played it for about an hour so i don't really have the same expectations as you i suppose but i think if you like the first game you'll probably like this one [Music] um there's a lot of talking though lots of cutscenes um the combat's quite fun i'm not really into the story that much i think some of the writing is kind of bad blood must be birdies i'm enjoying it i like their parkour running around and stuff okay i think you know when i was upstairs and i did the takedown on that naked guy i had to do it twice i think that's because of the level of that zombie and also the level of my character but yeah i think you have to remember as well that this is an rpg so there's going to be a lot of talking and cutscenes and character building and side missions and all that stuff [Music] so i've got to use my spidey senses here follow where that guy went in this building hey you find birdie not yet but he was bleeding badly i wasn't going down without a fight killed zombies on the [Music] did way lose the trail then [Music] he went up i can hear him [Music] um [Music] oh no he's ruined who are you a maiden can you move barney sent me he's a little kid of course good old barney

everything um can we can we really trust barney chad can we trust him i don't feel like we can trust him he's a bit suss i don't feel like i die that much so maybe stamina is better i don't know okey-dokey okey-dokey 24 damage was it where's that gun okay it's a big old two-hander test oh yeah [Applause] bye oh my god this thing's amazing you know we were just talking about peacekeeper and buying it from the us using a vpn someone mentioned something called soap someone said you can buy it using soap now were you joking as in pay for it using a bar of soap or is there an apple or something called soap where you can like play things internationally like what were you referencing because i'd actually be interested in that ow here's me saying i don't die and then i do that barney may be impulsive but he truly cares about the bizarre just gonna massage all the bees it's no big deal eric sophie i don't know things are better for us now right depends doesn't it veronica the guy was a prick the pk were a pain in the ass with him in charge conclusion's pretty straightforward lucas is gone things are better for us amen it'd be better if you just shut up barney where's sophie you again what are you doing spying on me you were supposed to wait for me supposed most plans changed afraid i was after your crystals huh afraid of you give me a break always a crystal we've got our own interest to look after pilgrim and they're none of your business to your men died for your interests you used birdie to distract me you don't know [ __ ] about me my people jackass birdie was like a brother to me for some reason my sister wants to see you so go bother her augustine i've heard this game is quite buggy what's been my experience i played it for four hours yesterday and i ran into one game breaking bug where i got stuck underneath the desk that's it that's the only bug that i've had like game breaking wise anyway i mean i've had like stuff like characters clipping through walls a couple of times but that's it really it's been fine for me we have to kill them carl they used to be family we must negotiate you don't negotiate with extortionists you're nothing like your mother this dude again besides i'm in charge here carl prepare your men and we're giving joe those goddamn crystals [Music] [ __ ] coward i know what you think but we have to listen to him herman that's for the bizarre only for the bizarre sophie relax herman he's saying he's like a monster interesting guy your little brother you two didn't get along i take it let's just say it wasn't love at first sight barney has his downsides but on the upside he is unshakably loyal and with so many problems plaguing old vilidor i just need people i can trust what are your problems you're the curious sort aren't you aiden just ask yeah i want to find out about the crystals why did barney bail on me crystals are valuable we needed them for a transfer is it lightsabers just tell me if it's lightsabers like i did with barney and birdie it didn't feel like much of a help barney was in shock when he heard about birdie that's why he bailed on you he he wants what's best for the bizarre aiden he thinks he'll protect us all can i build a lifesaver he did he was just a teenager when our mother died but even earlier when he was little we were always on our own now he's an adult and he doesn't need anyone but he hurts himself the more he tries to help others [Music] let's spat with carl what was that about let's just say the pk commander's death only made our problems worse look around aiden what do you see something people outside the walls could only dream of utopian people will be dead by the end of it why because in short order our water supplies will run dry two weeks ago a local thug named joe and his pal jack oh no you're the only one it was me they were in the area it was me not long ago they lived in the bazaar but carl threw them out for pulling scams and now they're taking their revenge they mind the tower and they're threatening to blow it up if they don't get a weekly tribute in the form of medicines food and crystals [Music] and all these people don't they know anything not how low the water reserves have gotten i was gonna handle it but carl was afraid of causing a panic instead he went to the pk for help of course he came back empty-handed they're only here to help themselves certainly not us they could care less that joe took the tower and demanded protection money my mother used to say never bargain with extortionists when she was still in charge here so before carl took power you she led the bazaar with an iron fist and carl listened to her after her death he became full of himself and he got cocky didn't your mother want you to succeed i know what she wanted for her people community and freedom that's what she always said but don't ask me what she wanted for me i don't know if i even existed for her at all she was a great leader but a shitty mom what are you gonna do about it what i have to do i promise to help carl so while he's in charge we're gonna pay off jack and joe and they're gonna keep squeezing more and more out of us and so on and so on the most important thing is for my people to be safe you've proven that you can be trusted i want to ask you for help carl believes joe will live up to his side of the bargain and that he'll give us access to water but i'm skeptical i have to send people to negotiate with bandits and i don't want any surprises carl and our people have already set out for the spot where the deal will go down make sure everything goes smoothly so i should guard them yes from a discreet distance [Music] are you guys saying that that guy looks like true geordie is that what you're saying in the background a scrapper hammer [Music] imagine not having water oh my god aiden something's up susie what is it you there sophie we're under attack what susie what's going on it was a trap run [ __ ] susie ralph ayden hurry they've got all the crystals everything we have no how we're gonna build lightsabers we're gonna go get em chopped don't worry [Music] okay i'm going to put a decoy well that didn't work i use this in warzone i can't figure out how to do this stupid dropkick i need to work it out these guys got armor on [Music] there was a spear over here i'm sure there was a spear [Music] guys wait i'm just looking for the spear wow oh my god the head i made it there how do i do the thing i have unlocked it yeah someone was having the same problem look i'm going to show you guys this is what it says ready air kick when dropping onto enemies from above nail them with a power kit while high in the air look down at an enemy and hold i'm not holding e i just pressed e that's why now we know chat now we know you need to hold it not just tap it everyone's dead i don't know what to do saying backup susie carl they took carl what where to their cab we must yeah this thing gay susie where are the crystals susie sophie i found susie she's dead i can't believe it everyone just keeps dying in front of adam now her damn damn damn there's nothing you could have done no except that i sent them there what's this joe's men have kidnapped grenades and i don't see these crystals c4 maybe uh [Music] hello maybe the crystals are still there you can see me there god i don't think they care about the meat do they what if i throw a spear in that thing i got something though didn't i there's nothing new in my inventory there's no grenade things in there hey can i kill him i kind of want to try massage massage i did see another javelin as well don't get trapped here [Applause] i want to find that spear where is it let me see it there's one all the way back here excuse me i did nothing sophie everything's been taken probably it's just a giant monster no big deal i appreciate it but don't get your hopes up not the marion kind of thing don't see a drink no i heard sophie's brother mention something about lucas's death that's all so far now they have a bigger problem the bandits you mentioned they took carl hostage ah [ __ ] yeah exactly i'm helping sophie get him back propane gain her trust that might also help us find out what they know just watch out they might be surprised but if you can do it oh my god what's it made of it's not tough okay okay i think the propane tanks definitely helped he's not that tough i thought he'd be more difficult than that big lads brick i got my own head just knock yourself out boom game over i'd actually love that if that was possible [Music] what are these things that i picked up did i not pick something up chat i thought i picked up like it looked like a grenade or something didn't it i don't see it in my inventory like c4 or is that just part of the quest maybe it's part of the quest physics don't apply to me [Music] stop it [Music] i think i've got a parkour point as well didn't i [Music] he put them back did he but why i mean surely something like that is really useful in this apocalyptic age do [Music] carmen hey herman does he talk or sophie oh oh hey why were you on the mission i could have used you he's like big peanut butter baby i guess that means that feel good oh it's one of my favorite videos on the internet that is maybe you did just throw them back in it was all confusing oh it's another flashback isn't it no [Music] this music reminds me of the last of us or joker you know the joker soundtrack mia it's a flashback i need to watch joker again they just announced they're making a second movie with uh todd phillips and joaquin phoenix [Music] aiden what's the matter with you mia where are you in the burning room [Music] oh no no no no did this happen or is he just dreaming [Music] joe will pay for what they did i had a bad feeling about it from the start i had a feeling carl's plan sucked and yet i let him lead i should what's the plan now from now on i'm following my gut last time something like this happens on my watch if you'd hurry back there maybe some of our guys would have made it i thought a pilgrim like you was supposed to run like a [ __ ] gazelle barney shut up what if he'd have made it in time to help we'd be having a party not awake in case you change your mind he can be a real pain in the ass but we'll do something good for the city one day birdie to your health if you manage to take out those bandits it jack [ __ ] and joe [ __ ] oh wow okay [ __ ] cart will change something is that necessary usually changes a lot in a person's life carl was wrong we should have gone after them right away but right or wrong we have to help him he's one of us we'll rescue him and retrieve the crystals from jack and joe besides i won't let them get away with killing my people ralph suzy logan birdie they deserve revenge and jack and joe sentence them to death so they'll die i have to kill myself and picks up static sometimes go see alberto he can fix stuff like that on the spot thanks hey tour here leave but make sure no one sees you you two make a pretty pair aidan i'm on the roof nearby we have to talk now it's about saving your life was it pathetic i'll tear them apart i swear i'll tell you my board there's a layer i can do a dodge stagger into a stick craft a couple mollies throw knives maybe maybe baby maybe baby and then i'm gonna eat myself off this roof see you later lads leroy kids no good idea that's another big boy there i'm not i don't have any health kits you can do 15. sheesh i've barely crafted anything so far inhibitor container detected is this 4k no we're playing at 1440p today blip so geforce now does 1440p 120fps and that's how i would prefer to play because like the input lag is basically nothing and the quality is great like the fact that this is a stream you're watching a stream of a stream and i'm playing this isn't that a bit crazy what do you want i don't like what's going on here aidan first jack and jose doc is talking about me again what's he saying now sophie's getting ready to retaliate you're not a part of that are you but you said you wanted me to get close to them i'm gonna search sophie's camp that's why i came to warn you he's watching this okay you found the lazarus for me i don't they may suspect you of being a pk spy my algorithms are incredible that's good you here to tell me this why would that be a problem you came here just to warn me you helped me with the lazarus and i take care of my allies he wants to know my algorithm that's all i don't think she suspects anything hi all thumbnails she hates the piece i'll come at the start she blames us for not helping good watch time there you go and for a mother's death so when we start questioning her people you better be careful thanks for the warning you gain any intel for our investigation sophie's also wondering who killed lucas what else would she say they know if we can prove they killed lucas it'll be a bloodbath find out from sophie he's watching it from yesterday okay cool keep me informed where you are be careful one day we might play some war zone together that would be cool one day i don't know what i just went around and hello sir sir care of yourself pilgrim i will mate don't worry ugh that's cool you just stick to the side the building like that that stamina boost has definitely helped though [Music] it looks like sophie's not here we're gonna have to search it must be dad it's still early this is the quest area just the this me and you are the same i'm looking for sophie where'd she go i'm looking for sophie where did she go [ __ ] which doesn't mean you have the slightest chance with me what the hell this is not natural speech if you think i was interested in whether you have a boyfriend i wasn't which doesn't mean if you change your mind about my chances i'll change my people do that fine what brings you you take care of barney today that guy is like a neon sign that reads big trouble right and here's herman munster i mean he ain't gonna give me anything is he quiet yeah i think so hey have you seen sophie there's big tom holland uh yes she went she said that uh the doc is watching right now okay cool exactly thanks wait there's more one more thing something's wrong with not working with the it's broken that uh oh dad's asking if there's something wrong with your radio oh uh it hisses sometimes but as long as it works no point messing with it you can fix it can i ask you a question sure call me ayden vincenzo aiden how do you become a pilgrim does that mean you're a murderer no vincenzo why would you dad i'm asking because i'm curious will you tell me aiden i'm not that exciting i've had to kill people but i'm not a murderer all being a pilgrim is to me now because it means to an end to what end vincenzo leave him alone to find the only family i've ever known did you not yet but i might be close i hope you succeed i've never found federico who federico he was my best friend we were like brothers we'd known each other forever he disappeared like the other kids because of those [ __ ] tests i hope he's alive and that you find him someday um it has the voice actors from borderlands is that right jb you can't play it in co-op people so yeah are you playing on g-force now yeah destroyer we are not interested i'm here how's your radio working now sometimes it works sometimes no roll the dice susie logan i swear i'll tear them apart and eat the pieces [Music] birdie ralph do your health i love you i love you more now do you remember the beginning of the fall aiden vaguely i remember it as if it were yesterday we've been defending the church against infected for some time my mother was in charge she was losing dozens of people every day she was keeping everyone alive while i was keeping an eye on barney she begged the peacekeepers for help but they ignored her eventually she was injured i'm not going to push her off he led me to her i don't even know if you can to the roof of the sacristy she saw me and made me promise to look after my brother she said it as if she was lending me a car and asking me to have it returned intact after that she appointed carl as her successor with me at his side you'll grow up to be a far better leader than carl she said but while the world is burning people won't listen to someone so young she was wrong i've been thinking like that all my life but not anymore now i understand my mother you have to be ruthless to be a leader i wasn't ready then i am now you can't push her off guys you can't do it and i know what loss is like talking about someone in particular about my sister i'm sorry yeah maybe you don't have to be we'll find out that's why you came to town for her yeah sophie we have to talk [Music] time to act the quicker we do this the less prepared jack and joe will be aiden aiden i'm gonna kill this dude and we started on the wrong foot his sip of courage should you be drinking this much before the mission barney me i got the toughest liver in philadelphia he looks like drama from the expanse about yourself you guys know what i'm talking about where's sophie there on the rooftop amina drama i'm watching you pilgrim she's not there anymore guys otherwise you know what would have happened don't you oh you can't kick or use weapons in this area dice please come on we talked about that didn't we [Music] i press the button let's see who gets who doesn't work guys there's no hitbox or anything apparently the peacekeepers are watching us i'll let them see what happens to jack and joe and that we can do it to them too well you said it was time to act we're acting i sent three scouts towards the camp carl and the crystals must be somewhere inside the building [Music] bandit camps oh no oh it's far cry then kill the camp leader and then claim the tower okay here we go not many guards not many gods the front one suicide they've got the most guards you go in first we'll move in from the other side and then we'll catch them in a pincer movement if anything goes wrong we retreat to our base where the tango motel respect for trying you gotta try [Music] okay kill jack and joe's lieutenant so there's an entrance there that looks like oh there's another one there as well [Music] here we go there's not many guys there's only 50. it's advised to use stealth here use the environment to distract your enemies sneak behind them i think i already burned it wait a minute they attacked our safe house who sophie you have my men there fine carl save him and get our crystals fast i'll do what i can okay so i've got decoys i've got coins i've got the old golden coins we're gonna go stealth mode guys are you ready for this yeah stick to the shadows it's about your speed don't you dare don't you dare [ __ ] sorry what i mean the electric is so okay ow he just killed him flashlight's on guys the flashlight is on oh i'm an idiot i have my flashlight on oh my god so stupid so stupid oh my goodness [ __ ] just kill me now i can't believe i've done that anybody else seeing this anybody else seeing this yes mate what do we have here i'm gonna try the dropkick yes we did it [Applause] okay physics don't apply in this game [Music] i think it's too late now uh yeah yeah not so big now are you i like how it was like stealth is advised on this mission immediately got noticed because i had my flashlight on and then they called several alarms and i'm ruined can he's got a predator mascot [Music] that is a predator mask isn't it look at that i'm right here dude now what are you doing i could have used that as well it's not stealth is not an option for me okay stealth is not an option i think everyone's dead though right dave there we go everything's fine [Music] fatality okay sophie i did it i keep telling everyone we should be getting ready for winter you guys came here quick pilgrim the greenwood family any time of day we thank you remember pilgrim greenwood green greenwood greenwood you coming with us pilgrim carl pilgrim where's everyone else they were attacked where are the crystals over there he's gonna like me now that i saved him i was gonna betray me radio sophie fast sophie i have carl he's okay what about you guys sophie sophie are you there you have to help the maiden where should i go tango motel sophie's hideout is there run fast i can't believe i let them fool me like that i admire sophie she has ten times the courage of carl oh you know i've only seen the first season of the walking dead is it worth watching at all i mean there's so many now isn't there and there's like a spin-off and everything i just don't know i'm gonna go with the yellow stuff oh sh i did not read that [Music] detected hey then i heard some noises coming from jack and joe's little village that's not all hack on sophie and barney's hideout was attacked oh no it could be peacekeepers not like this [ __ ] remember what you're here for aidan we were supposed to get into the central loop and not get involved in local conflicts don't get involved in this go back to the metro we will share what we have with atar mustard everywhere it does look a bit mustard hey golden dino what's up um i have to go hack on i promise to help sophie i think that's the first big choice that i've made in the game okay i think i made the right one uh john i'm not playing this on my computer i'm playing this on g-force now and they use a 30-80 for this machete 28 damage [ __ ] i'm too late sophie barty you there sophie sophie report in [Music] oh yeah look at that oh [Music] yeah i think i actually watched the um i watched the first and second episode of season two and then it was so bad that i think i stopped watching and then that was like 10 years ago what the hell is going on report in is she not in there [Music] [Music] uh [Music] climb up there maybe [Music] i should have enough stamina for this i think [Music] oh no you can't actually get up that can i get up this one yeah yeah nope okay pipe here i'm going to end up getting stuck in this aren't i [Music] [Music] nope [Music] okay i think that way and then up there [Music] what is going on sometimes it just doesn't it just doesn't work very well [Music] that totally looks like you can jump up it doesn't it [Music] what am i doing wrong here [Music] [Music] no hey that doesn't work either hmm that pipe there [Music] there we go and jump up here what [Music] it falls down am i being baited here guys [Music] i hate you i hate you so much [Music] there's a one this one nope let's see if there's a way in from inside the house maybe [Music] try this how are you getting subtitles when i'm live it's because youtube has a little bit of a delay on it that's why so it's like it is live but there's like a 30 second delay basically between what i'm playing and what you guys are actually seeing if that makes sense so youtube has the time to transcode what i'm saying and put it on the stream [Music] it's cool i mean it's it's good because you could actually watch live streams with the sound off like if you needed some you know privacy or you didn't want people to know what you were watching you could actually just you know turn your uh your speakers off and just have the subtitles on the live stream it's really cool i don't know if does twitch have that maybe they do does twitch have auto subtitles i think i'm gonna have to go that way aren't i figure out a way of that scaffolding [Music] oh my god it was right there i'm such an idiot actual dummy [Music] what's up we're going to be dead so what do you reckon chat uh hey thank you for the 100. you made me laugh so hard yesterday during that scene where the boss's voice only changed accents during the fight great on the on the vod though there you go great content thank you man that's very kind of actually starting to like you you brought the peacekeepers here i helped you you betrayed us and now we have to kill you help aytor and yourself helping us was just a byproduct what are you waiting for don't know what to do i have to file these hey barney barney wait i knew i knew it was gonna be barney with the betrayal [Music] i want to test out this stagger i'm getting the [ __ ] out no i think i timed that wrong hold on here i come you don't really get much opportunity is there you go that's it that's it choke on this ass i've got you now [ __ ] yeah baby ready for this a little bit quicker what's up sniper that was pretty hilarious good yeah i'm glad that you guys can see my incompetence live it's brilliant it's what makes it entertaining isn't it like i tried for about two minutes to climb up some scaffolding that i couldn't climb and all along i just had to go out the window and on a zip line it was that straightforward [ __ ] no figures no i don't want to kill her man he's he's not too smart but you know he's likable he's like hodor okay i want that weapon maybe i will try and kill him damn it this isn't about you herman get out of my way no i don't want to herman please can we talk about it big hammer for you let me talk to sophie i'm gonna die okay so if i that feels a bit cheap doesn't it if i go into my inventory it pauses the game l3 gen i'm doing molotov i'm going to throw a molotov at hermann herman i'm sorry bro [Music] okay it's fine that feels so cheap give it up let me talk to sophie i block him no no okay so you just can't block any of them maybe block the kick that's a double attack trying to heal herman herman god damn it herman i need to like throw molly at him and then then i can heal i'm sorry that didn't get you what hang on there was an electric thing in the corner and it exploded and basically killed him home and i'm sorry that's the first time that i've died in the whole game and it was at the hands of herman the german he's i don't think he's even german but we're going to go with him and the german anyway um what the hell's that catch always [Music] i mean you could have put it down a bit lower mate can you [Music] um [Music] pain [Music] any more of those boards on the windows oh it's up there okay [Music] the spawn traps on the walls etc one hit you can kick an enemy in there oh i see speckles so i could have actually kicked him into the electric thing where did you come from i've got a sixth sense i don't trust him anymore i just don't trust him barney wanted to kill you means he has something to hide something about lucas or worse what do you mean the murder of the commander now the takeover of the water tower that's no coincidence aiden barney has long been looking to get out from behind his sister's shadow and read villadore of the peacekeepers himself i'll try to find him be careful i'll go one ato let's keep in touch no i don't trust him why is he just showing up here he's working with him surely what new weapon did we get i might as well get rid of that 26 that's the one that i've been using i'm 18 15 20. 28 hello hey come out come on man i will find you i will find you and i will kill you hiding in here yeah nope oh it's safe with nothing in it debated okay cool i guess i mean it's gotta be through here cheeky upgrade love that some scraps in there love that he's in here isn't he um i'll go health this time if you ask nicely i'll shoot i won that crossbow and if not you'll spend a long time dying so you'll be the one dying barney you're supposed to stop him not kill him oh no give me the weapon give it to me brother the trail hope you know what you're doing sophie was in on it too this is the thanks i get for helping death is how we thank traitors you didn't say you were working for adam i don't work for aider i worked for myself no one can remain neutral in this ayden we're fighting for survival without water the whole bazaar will die in under a month and the peacekeepers they won't help us just like when my mother died they just sat and watched us die turns out you're one of them you don't care about us tell me why should i not kill you sophie shoot what are you waiting for can i have that [Music] we can help each other or try me i mean it's not very descriptive is it we can help each other because we can help each other who killed lucas he thinks we killed him sophie talk to me did you do it no sophie what the hell why do you care about this murderer what did aydor promise you hater promised me passage to the center that's why i'm helping him and you believe him just like that at least he didn't try to kill me he wasn't the one you betrayed but i can help you too help us with water and i'll take you to the central loop myself okay first i did not betray you i'm helping investigate a murder and that's different as for your offer isn't the only way through controlled by the pk there is another way i feel like that decision was pretty big again i don't know we you didn't tell us you were working with the pk so we made assumptions things are getting more dangerous and we all need to be careful you tried to kill me sophie i swear on the memory of birdie susie logan ralph and herman i'm sure if you help us we'll take you to the center will you help i mean i feel like i've already offered to right so i'm fine that's the plan as long as i get to kill barney jack and joe is kate we have a chance to take the tower oh yes home is not dead for fights pogs in the chat for hermann with the peacekeepers and getting you to the center immediately afterwards first we need to secure access to water how do i get up the tower it's almost impossible without a winch and joe's men sealed off access that's why i'm asking you so you want me to climb it if you do you'll save a great many people aiden we won't forget this [Music] i'm just glad that herman's not dead you know i think i got his weapon then as well didn't i oh herman's bludgeon come on i've got any mods on at the moment but they don't have slots all right we'll go to the water and that'll be the last mission for today i don't want to fall down there face i beg this is my break i hate this i hate you goodbye i'll never see you again goodbye forever nice come on just pretend it's skyrim there you go there you go there you go you go oh yeah look at that skyrim [Music] on the roofs again what's the food fire yeah stuck hey then what's the status it looks like the bandits fled the water tower it's unoccupied sophie says once i help them get the water back she'll show me another passage to the central loop sounds good she grew up here she knows every inch of this place and better than most taxi drivers but watch out for joe ayden the guy's a clown how about joe i can't take him out that's taller than i thought it's quite the tower st it's easy sophie jack and joe are in the tower they're gonna blow it up no dear god if they do we will have no water source come on aiden the tower is mined try to follow the charges [Music] can't just be one there right he's gear level based yeah is eric i guess we go further up [Music] i thought he was going to swing that and just blow it all up have i ever shopped at aldi yes i have someone alive it's a strange question i think most people in the uk have shopped at aldi right no one will give me the detonator jack we weren't supposed to take tribute just collect money jack give it back [Music] we on the moon or something it does feel like that sometimes huh [Music] oh shhh that was dangerous try and blow it i dare you best way to get a ps5 in the uk waiting lists i guess newsletters i don't know local stores that are smaller maybe either the bizarre jackholes or the pk you'll be honest hey boys stop over blow the goddamn tower i swear i found the bombs let's talk the time for talking is over we're gonna [ __ ] this place up you're not listening you're done i want it to be over and to leave the city safely i help me and i'll help you you're fooling yourself jack nobody's letting us out of here alive look i am a pilgrim let's just blow it up already i dare you i know you won't do it don't listen to him jack it's over [ __ ] it up i don't know i'm scared joe wait joe hey isn't that the pilgrim who showed up at the bazaar recently maybe pilgrim or pope so what don't you get it if he's a pilgrim he can get us out lead us out of the city to some place safe i don't trust that [ __ ] you don't trust anyone i told you to play nice with barney when we had the chance [ __ ] listen to me for once well play nice with barney what for to make him get the [ __ ] out of the bazaar after what we found out from the peacekeepers we tipped off the [ __ ] gave him a chance to run but he thought he was too clever for that i warned barney about what well about luke is wanting to take him in on weapons charges among others but set a trap for him for weeks and instead of politely getting the [ __ ] out of here he tried to play cute instead so barney knew lucas was after him the [ __ ] wanted to start a war in old villadore and you ask me war's the last thing we need money crystals that's a different story that's why i tried to put an end to that rabbit dog and his sister so pilgrim will you get us out of the city or what calm down joe i won't [ __ ] calm down get us out of the city pilgrim to the nearest safe settlement and no one will die here i can get you out of town but first i have my own business to take care of you need to hide somewhere and wait sounds like a huge risk no risk no gain he's lying jack there's no other way [ __ ] i don't like it i [ __ ] don't but okay we'll be waiting for you in the tunnels near the tango motel we'll give you a signal when we get there good choice now give me the detonator jack can i use the c4 now i'm kind of glad that it went down that way because i feel like there's a whole mission that's opened up there that i just wouldn't have had if i'd have just like fought them you know all these weapons that you throw them [Music] all right so what now aidan smart guy who gets control of the water what when you assign a facility to peacekeepers or survivors they start controlling the zone around it when the faction takes over zone it introduces its structures peacekeepers start installing combat focused traps while survivors build parkour helpers and make traversal easier [Music] so that's going to be easier to kill zombies it's going to be easy to parkour [Music] i'll start with survivors [Music] [Music] [Music] i like how they took the piss out far cry and it's basically far cry rotate backwards to open the city alignment zoomer level [Music] i did this [Music] okay hey then where the [ __ ] are you bonnie knew lucas was trying to capture him jack and joe warned him he could have avoided the trap but he went into it anyway that's when lucas was killed maybe we should check out barney's hideout at the hotel tango i'll make sure the place is safe cool right i think that's a good place to end the stream today guys it was a nice couple hours there enjoyed that i think my assumption about the well it was an assumption based on articles that i'd read about the game opening up after that first full level was correct so i think there's definitely been like less talking and more fighting more exploration more gameplay parkour that kind of thing in this session than it was compared to yesterday so i enjoyed it a lot more today not as much exposition but we'll see i think we'll be live again tomorrow to carry on and then maybe sunday as well so we'll see how it goes um and just another reminder as well this was all played on geforce now so i've been streaming this from a cloud gaming pc in europe which is pretty crazy um so i'm playing a stream and you're watching a stream of a stream stream section i thought what would be cool is if i just show you guys the process of like what you actually do if you load it up so if you bear with me one second i'm just going to check that there's no secrets on my desktop because there's always secrets on my desktop hopefully it's safe there i think it has jack messed up the water reservoir and the real jack saved it you're done right if you end now you have to jump um yeah so this is geforce now again big thanks to them for sponsoring today it's an nvidia program and i just logged in with my steam account and there are free games on here as well but basically you just log in with your steam account your epic games account uh there's some battlefield games on there as well um apex of course fortnite if you're into that but dying white too if i just click play here this is actually going to connect to a pc somewhere in europe with a rtx 3080 in it and now it's on my steam account and then it just launches the game and then you just and i could be playing this in 1440p 120 fps on my grandma's old laptop that's the beauty of it there you go then we're in the game and it's got cloud saves as well so yesterday
