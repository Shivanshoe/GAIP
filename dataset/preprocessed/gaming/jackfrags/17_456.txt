hi guys hope you're well today we are taking a look at star wars battlefront 2. if you weren't already aware up until the 21st of january you can get this game for free completely free on the epic game store and it's the celebration edition with all the extra skins and cosmetics all that good stuff and all you've got to do to claim it is you just log into your epic games account you click on the store page you click get and then it's on your account forever and you can play it forever but you have to claim it within that window so if you weren't already aware of this and you wanted to check out the game for yourself you've got until the 21st to do so and because of that me and some friends we decided on friday that we would download it again on origin origin and epic play together and give it a whirl again and it was a ton of fun it's a really well done game and it's kind of a shame in a lot of ways the development on this product has stopped so the game came out in november 2017. there was a lot of controversy around it with all the mtx stuff which was completely botched they turned it around they fixed it added a lot more content to the game and i do think it's quite a fun accessible casual shooter now especially if you're into star wars there's a lot of things to like here but then in april of last year when they released the scarif map the remaster from the first battlefront one map dice announced that they were going to cease all development on the game at that point and obviously that was a huge blow to anyone who played the game regularly or was looking forward to additional content down the line and in the statement they said that they were working on the final summer update for bf5 but a lot of their team were just focusing on the next battlefield game so they ceased production on battlefront 2 they seized production on bf5 and they just fully focused on the next battlefield game and with nextgen available now i think it makes sense why they would want to put all of their eggs in that basket for now but as i said it is kind of sad for the fans of the game and one of the most interesting things about this is on friday the game hit capacity when i downloaded it and tried to play it gave me an error saying the game was at capacity and i kept trying couldn't get in getting an error message all the time and then i got another error message saying that my account had been banned from online activities i thought well maybe all the years of wall hacking and aimbotting have caught up with me but luckily it was just a bug and error and eventually we got on we played some games together had a blast and yeah you could get this for free and it's on epic games i don't think the epic games user base is as big as steam but the fact that they hit capacity is pretty impressive and ea dice actually had to make a statement about this and update the server capacity multiple times to actually meet the demand and the amount of players coming on board that's cool obviously there's a lot of interest in this game epic have done this before with grand theft auto 5 i think that's the biggest one from the past but i wouldn't be surprised if the free version of battlefront 2 is in second place now and on a basic level it made me wonder is there any chance any opportunity that dice or ea or another studio revives this game and actually starts developing content for it again because there's quite clearly still a big demand for a star wars multiplayer title like this and i'm sure that there must be some people at the top of ea and dice now looking at those numbers looking at the concurrent players saying to themselves hmm okay well that's quite impressive maybe there's something we could do here in reality i don't think there will be and i think that a new product is much more likely but in terms of new content that could be added to star wars battlefront 2 there's just so much to choose from now that they could add in there especially if they were to decide to go ahead and make it a full free-to-play game supported by cosmetic only mtx it would be incredibly popular on pc and console no doubt there's already a ton of content in the game and i think before all of the latest disney announcements about future star wars projects there was quite a few stuff that they could have added to the game still maybe a few clone wars locations and definitely a ton of stuff that they could have pulled from star wars rebels but since april last year there's an absolute mountain of star wars content on the way from movies to tv shows and to games and a lot of that stuff could be implemented into battlefront 2. i think the most obvious one that most people would resonate with right now would have been the mandalorian that show has definitely pushed its way into popular culture and reignited people's love for star wars my dad watches it my dad as far as i remember wasn't a massive fan of the prequel trilogy he thought the new trilogy was okay but he's recently binged the mandalorian and he loves it and he says that it reminds him of when he was younger and he saw the original trilogy in the movies and then they started to release all of the side comic stuff about characters that weren't necessarily in the main trilogy that much but they were part of that expanded star wars universe and he would love reading the comic books and graphic novels and really getting into that and that's what the mandalorian reminds him of so if they were to put any kind of mandalorian content in battlefront 2 they'd no doubt be a ton of hype for it and i'm sure it would be really cool the mandalorian himself was a hero with the best car staff or the whistling birds on his arms the little flamethrower the jet pack some kind of game mode where you're protecting the child i'm totally down for that i mean you could even have moth gideon as the evil hero the villain with the darksaber so that would be the most recent obvious one but then again because of this explosion of people actually getting into star wars again they've announced so many other shows that could be put in battlefront ahsoka we got the live version of ahsoka she's getting her own series more people will know who that character is now there's a live-action version of it we've got the rogue squadron movie coming up so perhaps there could have been additional space battles based around that the ob1 series wherever that's going to take us the ranges of the new republic yeah that's set in the mandalorian timeline but those characters i'm sure there would have been plenty of gameplay opportunities and environments to visit there and then you've also got the acolyte which is a new show based around the high republic era not really seeing that in battlefront 2 and then of course you could go all the way back further to the old republic era and have some completely different gameplay opportunities even if you wanted to do more clone wars stuff the bad batch they were introduced in the final seasons of clone wars and now they're getting their own show too so they'll be more popular jedi fallen order calcus wonderful game some great good and evil characters in that too all sorts of stuff that they could have done but of course i'm talking with a lot of hindsight here and obviously they ceased the development of the game for a very important reason i can't imagine that it was an easy decision to make either it's not difficult to come up with these kind of ideas but what i really would have liked from battlefront 2 was to see different gameplay styles and game modes you know how a lot of live service games like apex legends fortnite even more recently warzone have started to introduce limited time events or different ways to play the game i think battlefront 2 would have been perfect for that kind of thing whether it was raids where you played against ai or something like that they've added ai to the game of course they've got bots could have been done perhaps making it more appealing to the destiny audience or that type of player and then silly stuff like pod racing i used to love that pod racer game back in the day imagine if they did that in battlefront 2 and then they could have done more intense smaller game modes too the engine's very good it still looks absolutely fantastic as you can see it runs great on all gen consoles like the base ps4 and xbox one they could have done a next-gen update for ps5 and xbox series x 120 fps 4k 60 autographics if you wanted that as an option all that good stuff do a full next-gen re-release i don't know i'm just thinking about all the possibilities that could have been and i like to think that there's an alternate timeline out there where dice had twice the number of employees and they had a much bigger budget for the game and battlefront 2 is still receiving updates it's a live service game that lasted for five to six years rather than two to three as i said before i don't think this will happen i don't think the game will be revived especially as the creative director recently left the studio but isn't it fun to think about what could have been and that's all for today folks do let me know your thoughts in the comments down below if you weren't up to speed with the other star wars video game news it was just announced that ubisoft are developing a open world star wars game with massive entertainment and they're responsible for the division franchise not much is known about the game other than that it will run on their snowdrop engine which is very impressive indeed and that's definitely a game that i'll be covering in the future with that said if you enjoyed this video leave a like thank you if you didn't a
