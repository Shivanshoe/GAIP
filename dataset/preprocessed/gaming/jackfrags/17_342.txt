is there anything better than sniping on battlefield one maybe an apple pine custard i'll give you that one but apart from that it's pretty damn fun that's what we're doing today sniping on suez i like to exclusively play sniper on this map there's some brilliant opportunities here let's get into it is that enemy horse over there i think someone got it i've got the russian 1895 sniper here awesome weapon missus great picking people off a distance like that and also missing them like that oh love it it's at the center there see yeah someone's got it i wasn't gonna pick it up anyway because i wanted this to be a sniper video that tank there looking dangerous right now but so am i the great thing about this map is these sun jeans you can just pop up and down get those head shots i'm not gonna be able to take on that horse unfortunately so i'm gonna get into cover i could do some chip damage the no scopes on this are insane absolutely crazy oh the tank's on us oh no i was killed by a small white cat giving me the finger i just it's only on a sunday morning i can't be dealing with that hostility hello what are we doing here then are you looking for snipers up there mate i saw some enemy infantry there there's a bullet over there too slow nope all right that guy's definitely going to know that i'm here so i'm falling back again that's the bayonet challenge is it right in the sweet spot that was let's go more snipers here cooler oh no no no right there's so many snipers there okay i'm gonna get these just have to do one at a time there's someone else shooting at me there yeah there's someone here isn't it oh he's got the little sniper shield you don't often see that dear i can't believe someone's using that you know it's kind of cool to be honest always got to watch out for the horses any more snipers up there i think there's a yeah that's a head oh the train's coming what was that you just explode them like melons it's so satisfying right that's the train absolutely destroying me got a fallback i should move position now i think i've been down there for a bit too long head over to the southeast here what's on the cannon can i see the head there oh my god he got a sharp on me mate that was close wasn't it that was too close that effect is so cool you see it come on you just wait for that perfect moment and then send that bullet that guy's lagging like crazy have you ever tried to explain to someone who doesn't play games what lagging means it's quite difficult really i managed to take the d point back i don't know if we can push them off one of their soldiers that trains definitely help them too that dude was just about to go pro and put down some fire with that lng i'm looking right in an enemy soldier so the same guy oh it's a snipe off it's a snipe off why can't i i can see a glint through the rocks there or something see that guy's hit me you can smell the blood once we get the finish ideally i want to push up this right side here and get the flank on that would be perfect right now that dude must have been low hp there he is i think that's the glint that i could see through the rock all right chill here for a sec let's go all this smokes come in i don't know what that's about just kind of came out of nowhere okay we all kind of getting around behind in here gotta watch out for that e point though give me that to play assault for a bit god [Music] there's a lot of enemies around oh my god hp all right where do i go i want to find some stairs or something put a cover grenade there someone just threw an aid at me i'm getting out of here mate goodbye ah oh i was gonna have a blast with that thing teammates still alive there somehow i know he's on the fire no let me spawn let me spawn yes right who was shooting at you that's a bad miss okay okay okay there's another guy down here somewhere there's more grenade there i love this type of gameplay oh my god this is the true war now look at this people everywhere what the hell [Music] otaki knows love that voice line is there more here no no there's smoke stirred up now that's the guy that's really laggy oh god i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead oh i was trying to hang in there for as long as i could this map is absolute chaos sometimes but you know i've had fun let me get someone up here gonna get a knife kill before the end of the round all right oh i did okay hey we got the win though it's gotta be cyano doesn't know those two well thank you for watching guys although it is a bit chaotic i always find this game really chill and enjoyable i hope you liked the video if you did leave a like and a comment down below thank you got a ton more battlefield videos coming up very soon june is just around the corner it's nearly time subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next
