everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more call of duty war zone today I'm joined by Matt imio very good friend and Stone Mountain who I've played a few games of war zone with before and it's just been an absolute blast so today what I wanted to focus on was using the growl so I've seen a bit of discussion in the community a few people have said that maybe the growl is a little bit overpowered there's a bit of a stigma behind it but I've used it a little bit and I really like it like it's arguably one of my best loadout weapons between this and maybe the m4 the m13 in squads mp7 is definitely my favourite in solos but today we're gonna be testing the growl and this is how I've got it set up I got the monolithic The Tempest arc angel tack laser commander for grip and the 50 round mag you know what I'm gonna put the 60 round mag on instead well I that might be better for warzone that's what we're going to be focusing on today and of course having some fun with stone and meta me oh now just a warning I am playing on US service so might be a bit laggy at times but I'm gonna make the most of it we'll do our best and have some fun thank you so much for coming along and watching guys and yeah let's do this right ready to rock let's go they should do it well here we go yeah I really like that skin stone because I feel like it's the only one that has a fall ghillie suit yeah this uh this bushes is dynamite I like it of course when you're like on the edge of a building or something then you really stand out pretty hard but you know I've had some nice place where I sound a bush and got a reload off and they didn't they didn't look they missed it many people just hiding in bushes and soullow and I literally cannot see them because that skin like I'm literally you feet away I see them on their mini-map I'm staring directly at them and the only reason I'm able to see them is because they moves lately yeah there's some other some bushes that are like tree type bushes that you can't go into and then there's other ones that are small enough that you can get into like some of some of the trees - I noticed if you've been trying to drive through them you just you hit that tree and stop and then you can kind of use them for cover I don't know gotta up your [ __ ] game man Matt you're the one that's got over your bush game right now does it come with a dog too and get your dog tea now the dogs from the battle pass level level 20 I think yeah you need the dog assault look a dog execution on you imagine if you could get a ghillie suit for the dog really be styling water Infiniti will do in Minot by that in a second where is the dog cameras that's an easy couple million oh dude dog have you guys played any today no I'm gonna be a bit rusty it's been a couple days for me a couple days even on tolerant not valor indeed Final Fantasy 7 hey is that we make it I never played the original because I didn't own a Playstation because it was a child and I didn't have money but yeah the remake it's weird though it's weird I'll just say chapter 9 is what do you mean I I don't want to spoil it because I write yeah it's it's we it's just wave you once you play chapter 9 you'll know exactly what I mean right okay I never I never played it back in the day so I didn't know if you how well it holds up to playing it today the remake I didn't play the original one you know like I thought it's quite different like they changed a lot yeah that's what I hear too but like I said I don't have a reference so I can't really say right anyway there's no

sometimes those Recon contracts are so far away yeah yeah 150 meters out 200 meters sometimes there's one over there but I assume that's a different squad like 205 205 yeah I saw one earlier over sir east as well other side of the river but I was a little while ago okay so vortex gamer are you doing hello shall se asked of its we are we're gonna get sandwich there I think we should get to the UAV

ammo for that fight so there's a loadout drop are we going for that stuff that's what I'm thinking man am I thinking the boys will get us button right now I think we grab that and try and go back to this city over here or something okay I'm down there's also a pic up there too yeah let's do this thing Zachary Chadwick thank you for becoming a new member small fries seeing Jack and Matt play reminds me of the bar filled three days yeah we had a lot of good times on bar filled three you know me Matty me Oh x-factor level-cap we used to play all the time for only we had plates I know do you that was the last fight we didn't like Noah couldn't reset LJ and Kay thank you for becoming a new member oh man now your armors already popped Oh I named my growl Oh doubt mine brah they surely spawn armor so it's a good name hopefully give it some armor give us the money we need to get Jack back here what ping do I have on this server then matter as long as doesn't take us too far we should be all baby what I'll keep an eye out see these guys are crossing dealing with it oh no they're still up in the window there though what's up Nagi hello da the next one Tanmay was a while thank you for becoming a new member and Aaron Williams that's very kind you guys I appreciate it up so you need a mother's a mo station in here something I've been working on I don't know if you guys have seen the snake shot three five seven revolvers in a Kimber if you guys play war zone you may have come across them or you may have seen other content creators using them but you know that really terrible 357 revolver if you level it up enough and get the Recon purr and then you get three kills in five different matches you can unlock a Kimbo for it so you got a Kimbo when you put snake shot and laser on it and it just deletes people is insanely good so I'm working on a video where I look enough because it's it's hilarious it's so broken I think it's quite funny but that maybe tomorrow coupe thank you for becoming a new member a rose if you want to send me a clip you can tweet it to me hopefully these boys will buy me back if there's no one camping that by zone man we'll see Edward thank you so much for the five love your streams after a long day as a doctor fine covered Edward Harmon you are you are essential you're the best do you doing what you're doing man farmer inside for you as well thank you Oh Jax got 1500 he can buy armor hey there we go okay get him some guns though other any guns are on this m4 there looks like those are no yeah it's like a custom loadout they're not Lodi so far away 500 meters somebody killed them or something here Jack thank you yeah this is all been looted it's not a bad come up no not too bad one edges on here it's basically there's a ram if you need it will do is that suppressed yeah I probably should pick up that bounty just some skinny give us some Intel there's some money over in that building there Oh big one has a bit of a [ __ ] thought you've identified your gauge what's this guy I don't mind that saya I think all right we should be good I wouldn't pick up myself let's go grab a stack of plates I'm rocking three plates now I got three as well I'm gonna buy a stack you can take the extra extra sounds good oh man I want I want to get down low down again we a firefight here yeah I've got my perks you guys got here yeah I mean I got overkill but I've got good it was gonna be online me but we can make 10k no my guess is we're probably enough to just wait for zone 5 here the next loadout although it's cut I've realized it's really hard to get that second loadout which is good in my opinion yeah I know that's good but the zones so small that it's like unless you get really lucky and it drops next to you it's probably not worth it to risk it and go get it mmm I've died so many times trying to get that loadout I think we go try and kill this kill contract dude you want to go for it try I mean I don't know the thing is there's no more buy stations left so we're pretty much money's not gonna matter anymore jam streak thank you for becoming a new man back and hold on the alchemist is dream legendary Carl thank you for the sin and death greet you thank you for the 5 what sensitivity mdpi I plan 9 sensitivity and a 400 dpi oh this thing it's tomb there we're good on armor though looking down this route oh there's another buy station right here yeah that's nice we might get people coming for it is this gonna be the last one in really exposed - yeah I don't like going on that roof I want to jump inside cuz I'm a coward up there how many did you say up that day a Stassi Betty I don't know I mean I don't know how many I didn't see I didn't see anything okay yeah they're probably dug in a bit worried here Aaron did you see the hacker on nadeshot stream that got 49 kills no I didn't that's insane it shouldn't be allowed to happen a Fredrik thank you for the 35 more than 1 billion to all views yeah Fredrik we're trying our best man trying our best took me eight years to get 1 billion views but I'm really has the widest use RPG so I can use ghost it's a good call but sniping is way more important in trios yeah I just feel like it whenever my team has snipers and I don't I just feel like I'm so useless yeah yeah that's what I don't know because this is the last the last my station as well it's gotta be people coming for this we just can't that hard wiping out itself raises for us you know about being nice come up kill you a V or two we're a separate game damn did you put that proximity down there no I did not okay I was already here dirty dirty neck zones just the help result do we want to go far right loop around yeah I'm down remember that's where all the problems are going so there are people up there they're gonna be moving in either that or left now I think we'll probably run into less here we'll see I guess it's quite laggy should just stick together so we can trade at least I don't want to go on this building but probably I've ever been down over here mm-hmm so he's got a neat it's like an adventure it should be a crazy end zone here like still shine [ __ ] is it he's just by yeah Amazon got the RPG nah I do but it's a little far away he's going for the drop I'm the road check Raider on the right on down you got one edges on there good blood that truck I'm working

pretty deep south zone any of options there could even go to like promenade here yeah I like that this area here is gonna be really busy so it could be quite hard to beginner I'm cool with that Quinn tree we're trying to get the load out I get the ground as fast as possible Han another teams landing on that exact contract so be cautious go on I'm in trouble Toby it's too outside found one I was preparing what a green marker one here LMG not really yeah further in sonar level Mountain just hum disco he just ran in the door there behind them there you go there's more in there okay there was at least two shoe thing I didn't broke the glass on the other side of the building on the roof yeah right in front of a stone yeah yeah in that window I hit him he didn't have armor so he's hurting in

celestial sky thank you for becoming any member Rico thanks again and Ezra thank you for the five [Applause] [Music] so like a so like it team up on one team here well pledge done well this place is a nightmare dude it's been living here jack there's nothing okay I wonder like this building here baby yeah that's so I'm gonna head to yeah we got one open crates can you get out of there stone or is it ruined yeah I'm backing off I was just flying a little pressure okay little reset world it's all good how many more squads of that it was still two squads fighting each other there okay oh they just had to go company mom I'd have been a Gulager coming back and then gotten fine I don't know I teamwipe to one of them now II don't really want its the Dragunov isn't it yeah it's not it's not for me the Dragunov is just awful I don't even know why it's in the in the game like why is it in the game how about I think Acula is playing with a couple other people today you want to go for that there's some zoning to although we do want to go up north which is fine work our way there have you guys had any use with the gas need ever oh yeah really but you got to use it a very specific way how do you use the strategy where I used a riot shield it's gone oh they're fine somebody's pushing them don't like that though yeah I got roof right now but stone I've got plates for you oh I got one I'll take it just get out TAC pro tip yeah he's on the roof he's on the roof I'm some safe I'm safe whoa I'm just worried about his friend do you want to back out of this guy's yeah I'm cool backing out yeah that sounds fine I just feel like that's really messy because it's two squads fighting in that building hit him a little bit could get that quarter maybe and then could we score on to off like I don't know how do you think I'm gonna buy some other place potentially they'll probably probably dive on it yeah I need armor plates too I'm gonna buy extra armor plates as well okay you want to grab some extra on the ground actually got powerchute coming in here way out there we want to loop around well loop around towards green so we can start heading towards this bounty or we given up the bounty um we could go kill the guys up on the spine station okay oh yeah where does it clean more work on vehicles well we got us it does doesn't just don't fly put a claymore down and then the Hammond just drive right anything to the death okay he's there he's just Lou I see if we can just scrape this guy out I think he's on at least two miles Jim chill here Wayne see if they're getting the call we can just lime up ready wait wait wait okay go one zealand ones living there shattered just jack he's inhaling on the right yeah right there to the right I can see through the wall think that's

guys did you see that growl it's like no recoil on it whatsoever like just absolutely beam that guy got one live ping another coming from the opposite direction live things I downed one thank you to your rear he's coming into the building now he's on inside blue building if he goes on the roof I'm gonna bayman this one still I think this is the one you down right still both threat gas is pushing as well guys we're in the zones pretty close that's far far away I'm coming to you guys hopefully I don't get killed I'm gonna try and I can't make it to that guy we can get the other guy you knock though gas must care anyway get his loot you mean yeah I don't know where he crawled off to you oh here he is verted job guys run around and this time we got actually got so for us to keep thinking behind most oh we got a distance to go on this one yeah let's get going do I hear someone behind me then we do have an enemy UAV up as well well I'm scared guys I'm so scared redo photo husband Bob I'm amazed I have enough for one but stop on our way this is gonna get crazy I've just got a feeling it's gonna pop off soon it really is cuz we got distance and the zones about to start closing Oh Wendy thank you so much I appreciate the kind words do you feel it you're kilometre I'm gonna grab a UAV if you want to grab I don't know can grab two of them actually I grabbed one UAV a drop some cash man I'll get another one yeah it's a good idea yeah okay that's three three levels that very very interesting now I gave you everything I don't know why I dumped it like that all right I'll pop mine a call thank you so much for the five appreciate you walking home for the nhsn path so far at least counting four ghosts keeping us all safe and sound yeah I've made that mistake before my just been piling on the pounds in isolation I'm afraid to miss chocolate over here yeah stones got some legendary videos ending especially on put you try and just make it deeper into like the blue building here I don't know if we can make it but I know I just drop that ass try spreading out of this blue building though pretty you steadily I may be showing up on radar at least do you want to pop you AV stud I just popped mine okay I don't do I did see I dis your microwave oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you try and take like this building or something hole squatting the fire station go ahead all squad in the central building fire stations looking I see that man did they see us maybe there's ones out on the roof take a shot we're still not in zone here though you're right maybe we can neither are they though they're that neither are they we push now straight straight there is a team in this building we could try and silent approach them both guys close to us yeah you know that's that team okay this was a team of three here window shooting me I'm down and above and above huh another um another downstairs at that window still I'll try gay okay building yeah they're close built specifically the big building this well we want to hook a little bit right now there's no way we can go right come on clean we can work our way in here do the fire station teams moving now you gotta go we gotta go I down one behind I'm pushing now alright fire station is moving off our left side might be okay here yeah it's gonna be real rough with these guys on elevation on us still one behind I got an air strike find me another behind c-4 put an airstrike on you guys [Music] does an airstrike on you careful above us in the building with me anything more closer I maybe not yeah good cop how are we alive right now I don't know is anything inside an outsider Oh both sides boys both sides stupid automation so there was an entire team in the inside oh my gosh show us so many people did that animation with the mask it gets me killed so many times yeah my just late let people manually put it on like come on so frustrating to be killed when you guys a mask on mask off mask on once that wasn't that huh I want to say was that how was in battlefields in Firestone firestorms don't know didn't have like a mask I don't think I'm thinking I feel like there was a game where you could toggle a mask off field one you could do that but the guys just like for ya general gasp that must been when it was mud they were all throwing needs over I mean hindsight's 2020 rival I think the best play then would have been to go like far left around the fire station and maybe avoid does big buildings I don't even know we could have gone because there was an entire team at fire station well we killed I I killed to off of a fire station steam there was one more and he drove off byah okay um that building's roof stills has free rein sniping at us there was no way for us to know that there was gonna be a squad inside and outside yeah yeah that was the bringing together they're 2020 let's go get definitely a lot of people there though that growl though I mean it's nice isn't it like without serve some of those long range kills that I was getting whoa you just hold mouse wand and it's just note no recoil on it I don't think it's great at close range but in a situation like that you don't have any other choice right like unless add an mp7 as a secondary but I think medium to long range like from what I've experienced so far today Brow's nice one it's real nice oh just thank you for the five hope you get a drink after fighting the whole server thank you very much hutch just a random person yeah i played insurgency sandstorm it's really good fun I just wish that it would be regularly updated I'd be interested to see how that does on console Battle Royale Monica drop point for your team you'll need them in molt do you have any advice on when to save and use airstrike when you've down someone molt when you've got it down a Kyle thank you for this - always been a huge fan hope you're well thank you very much Carl bo-zone action goin bones on don't wanna go on a bone zone we haven't done that

one - yeah why not do it that's come towards the enemies we go hit this one I guess well we won't have enough money for a loadout and self is selfs probably actually okay looks like it's just him for now he's running that'll do yeah he's peace now got people on the edge of the bone zone as well he's a running I don't think I can reach him Slater good it's just just gonna come all right we got you do we do we do I don't know what it is with me in gas masks I just I just don't pick them up for some reason sometimes like it doesn't register in my brain I'm like I don't need that that's fine

Sonja's latest attack on three Khan's right there no I haven't jack depends on what do you want action or more Intel oh I got some money I think actually whoa Anastacia action ammo station in here thank you very much what keeps ammo not random ability this for you man I think I just got your name on it just me oh you're all right yeah look at that McKinney oh wow Timmy oh okay these guys are

station 80,000 people who used to live here who's got a res they just read my station that was a player but it was actually just a pole a pole okay just making sure they just raised I've not done that one before Matt I have to be honest you know what when you're lagging this hard Jack everything looks like a player on the stairs in below Prats a guy up here cracked one popping UAB where is he guys

back try go for that maybe I swear there's like never contracts a farm land I don't know if a lot of people just they're all her and take them all or what I think so it's I think it's I think there's certain areas that just don't have a lot of contract you kind of screwed I unless there's a lot of boxes around Jack that's not the confidence I want to hear from you you're gonna do this smile I'll be fine will respawn and win the game oh this is real bad you were ready for a sound round a Benjamin tipper thank you for the said love your vids been watching for five years never get to see a live

ak-47 or the FAMAS for maximum fun oh man the a K in war zone ah I just don't think it's very good like the rate of fire on it it doesn't have enough damage yeah no pressure Matt we're all counting on you Drax and Drake thank you for the 20 that's very kind have always been such a huge fan keep it up is the SI 87 opium war zone will more you know what will I've never used the SAE 87 in war zone I've never used it what I consider using it maybe but I don't think it would be very good in my opinion what's up Alexander how's it going mm in the bike hello Scott Franklin how are you unproductive production from Florida checking in what's up man how you doing yeah I mean I think all of these games have been on us West's or lovers which isn't as you can see it's quite laggy but you know I like playing with these guys and they're both on the west coast it's only fair if we were playing on European servers two people in the squad would have terrible pings so I don't think that's conducive to actually trying to win the game Hussein any wins today look from Kenya no wins today yet Hussein will try Kirk thank you for the ten now I must got a problem here he'll gourd thank you what's up the zone sewer I wouldn't engage oK you've got enough cash now map by spot right now there's gonna be a little delay it's gonna look like we're in a lobby but that's just gonna look like we're in a new

our way there I don't know how we take those guys mm-hmm that's why I just avoid buildings at all costs especially late-game like that she walked is an interesting word MA I've never heard you use

so they either pushed in with him or they're gonna be here in the building in the building yeah I don't think this is a good idea yeah probably not we've had a bad time when it comes to no one's further out heading to the north they might be running ok essentially yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh come on come on adjacent Bank you've been 20 that's very kind are they still in the building nice down okay growl that's the ground they have a parachute Iran penguin I'm pushing in they leave the building huh I don't know I think that was the one in the building ran down the back and was just running

of cop times yeah excellent one bailed out the Gila all right in this construction building here a bit worried we're making like love the noise and sad a full team back over there though they're

Oh back behind us is a respawn here is all moving I'm going it's kind of really he's really Hail Mary in this man yeah he is he's not even using a sniper he's just going around he's just like I'm gonna knock I'm gonna triple knock these guys with an SMG from 200 meters watch this he parachute into the right we've got another one on blue pings are heading for the rights full up too right oh

Jeep coming up behind us they are going down you're saint two left double down oh oh oh it's magic on the hill I just got RPG that's not great I'm inside seeping crawl in you know where from nah I

behind the ridge he's gonna be able to get the res on that oh I really need to get to that shop and buy some other place or a shop just like waste and low the plates there for no reason we could go

sniper I got a couple armors myself you don't even have the cash the cash for this beer I got money I'm coming I got UAV off that guy to you I don't think there's like repeat me funny dumb thank you very much okay all right we've got to think about next steps yeah we really want to just get deep into the zone here I think we try and push left and clear this team that was on the hill I think we can take these guys that's the best block time a whole bunch I knocked him so many times they're not gonna have armor I don't think okay there's one of them packed he's gone away oh yeah we're right I think the fact I'm being so passive now that yeah I think you dead on we can get these guys okay I'm gonna [ __ ] poppy UAVs well he's up the rock there nothing öktem nice we pushing hard Oh another one shooting at me got armor least one of them dead these guys Joker out watch out I think he hit me man why is he even put it on that door you just put it on the door randomly that's so much money oh

you're invisible if I do down that first guy in that initial burst I don't think I'd have been okay that tricky man we shouldn't have pushed that that hill though I think we should have gone towards the town this is so it's so like open there you know I think we made the wrong player either Bush that's good fun what's up Kevin nice time to join the stream yeah I was really stuck there because I had no cover to run down the hill my only option was to fight really buns I was the bad eggs under thank you for this wedding any cheers today echo light I don't think so don't think so actors you

that's more of just having the heartbeat how do you get a heartbeat in the first trip what if you're dead I don't know dude I need to talk back when when a man and a woman love each other they uh they uh so there's a child that comes as a storm he cut off yes so the stork arrives with the new human did you really I mean you missed this every shot you don't take right he's gonna turn into Wow oh you

RPGs no I'm all olive okay that's not hitting us who's slightly behind us we can kind of decipher where he's coming from babe is that how it works yeah that's where it calls in from I think it's not the Haila I'm running low on ammo oh I hear one in here oh he's in here there's a claymore he's in he's in we're not with you give it a I'm not pushing I'm not pushing well he's in here he's got a

out hey get up wash out wash up why are we ready RPG man Sun full Sun I got EOD the right to the right around corner about come on nice what is going on dude I had no arm rows like where like if I die I mean we just made a lot of noise then we need to guess there was more than one teaming what we wanted to do was secure come on yeah you say I'm screwed can we back out of this go back out of this dude Jesus Christ there they won the mem and they know what they're doing these are people's are just crazy bro get out let's go back just get to a buyer gets thrown back do he's still sending it I feel like RPG should stay same damage against vehicles but reduce damage against yeah infantry definitely need to do less damage to the two infantry is they just the most half right like you just just have to have them that's not interesting I mean you can say the same for a sniper's - yeah but sniper takes a bit of skill to use RPG does not jack hey I dropped it I dropped it thank you no I do agree even though in our I'm an RPG lad well that's because I play solo you're still got hoppy sensor gas goes yeah yeah let's check it right nothing I'm out I've got this on my plate thank you thank you it's dog get back in the game let's go do I want to go for my by rme for my um there's a lot of gear there but there's a lot of death too well so I could go back to that loadout back there though just like far away from you as a problem I totally know where we are as all so I think I might try and go for my loadout boys for him to Moo okay it's far AF but uh oh my now that fight was crazy adrenaline is good friends and something thank you for the tank Jeremy okay you Ava except I own the place do you need Alma flight smart I'm good I'm gonna buy myself a cell-free Rio I drop you cash gay UAB pop it straight away okay so we've got a team up here and I'm just surrounded we got another team there to buy the other green by the bunker yeah yeah okay when we're spread out we both get the UAV effect thank you so much Jeremy yeah because I'm seeing one pinging over by blue here like way over here it's based on your location at school I didn't know that today I learned I swear there's someone like over - they came this way yeah there is yeah there's definitely something in that direction I don't know if exactly there but I don't really like this position I don't think it's very defensible they were next to a bi and people could just rush in and you guys won't come towards me here I'm more central I don't know yeah yeah that could get that truck mount would you think do we need the truck though we can do if you want no it's Tom's only 150 meters away okay not worried about then we just notify everyone yeah dude that that squad there were enough panga right at the back door they had a claymore and approximate mine and then further down the corridor they had another Proxima my drill rip I am I'm actually surprised that we won that fight because they had RPGs in a small corridor like that I mean you're a big disappear and we were pushing them too which is like not great when they have RPGs yeah is that commanding officer welcome Bay recon beacon southeast yeah yeah do you want to play edge line we should try and clear up the hill here yeah that's a good idea Oh vehicle to the rain I just saw movement firefight over there to you I'm blue 200 meters out people were shooting at it from over there okay you won't turn your hacks off there and stone ah I think we need a man I don't know okay at this point we might using clay morrow 54 all done behind us behind us sniper sniper one down nice see you down see why thank you a bit worried now more armor I'm gonna go in there you wanna hit that hit that we may still have a team over Northwest here yep top wait nope no we're good no no no no okay but potentially I could just see a crows line like what there's lots of plates there fantastic gotta get in the zone again clear out this side of the area I did stay real close guys right on us to the right northeast northeast no eyes on I'm gonna confuse you north of me you see them no I'm at my heartbeat do you want to back out of this end good they I don't see him anymore on them on the heartbeat it moved away it's double that they're moving north we're gonna have to get in the zone maybe then I'm worried about right once you go back they definitely feel back the blue mark or the green and blue they're in that bunker one team drove in there we want to be team wipe well so just one guy nice shot I'm gonna watch our Southwest real fast yeah just don't like that area there like that feels like we're gonna get ruined from there yeah yeah you know there's only four of the sames life well in zone here whoa I think I might go for my package here well one of the teams is gonna be in the left yeah I'll be in the hangar oh no they can't be in the hangar Oh sniper shot over there maybe yeah you hear that yeah I heard it there was a hundred percent yeah they're in that bunker they're in that but I gotta fly it yeah I mean did we do cleanup crew or just leave him what do you think well we got one on one team unaccounted for here that's gonna be the hit him a little bit not much yeah we need to watch our left are they the ones shooting in there nope okay alright then that might be the final team if you want to drill these guys when they come out in the open in the open broke armor I've been down nice shot air strike boys don't know where that line is [Music] he smoked it yeah I'm a on me I'm dead I'm dead yeah he's here well I think as well other side just survived a fine come on stone you can do it one's gonna be here right come on stone we can do it let's go I want to say I want to say is in the gasps I've stayed in the gasps I should have known like you asked masters didn't go up I'm okay I think they came out of the back of the bunker yeah I think you're right but then there was another team on our right as well and I don't know cryptic yeah yeah in that not woods to the right they came out at the same time that the other team came out of the bunker oh man well cuz we had the team in front of us we had a team when the two teams on the left I thought fighting each other so was that the fourth team on the right was there four teams I don't know man that was good game no I was good fun yeah it was good I think I'm gonna leave it there for tonight guys that was a good good play with you as always man yeah let's do it again yes it's fun oh yeah Bobby oh actually all right boys and girls thank you so much for watching that was a lot of fun unfortunately we didn't get a win but that growl is pretty spicy I like that build if you want to see what I was using that's it I did show it at the start but that's pretty much it if you want to copy that Anders feel free with that said thank you very much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed it thank you very much for all the kind donations new members everyone commenting in the chat I really appreciate it tomorrow if I can get it finished in time there may be a video on the akimbo revolvers we will see if I can get enough footage but yeah they're really fun to use anyway with that said that was the growl I don't think it's okay I've heard some people say it is but it's it's definitely a solid choice especially at medium to long range close range you're gonna suffer I think I'd much rather have an m4 at close range or an MP 7 but medium to long range it's nice but that said guys if you enjoyed this livestream or this video if you're
