today we finally got an update from the battlefield communications channel about updates to the game and additions coming in the future i kind of wish that i'd have just held off on doing that video yesterday because they posted this at about 10 a.m uk time this morning so i was about 14 hours too early in this particular case so we're going to take a look now let's talk about the next set of updates coming to battlefield 2042 and what to expect in the coming weeks here's a thread with news on upcoming patches portal xp changes and updates on requested features like scoreboard and cross-platform voice over ip update 3.2 scheduled to go live tomorrow this update delivers a handful of small fixes and improvements to the game focused around stability we'll have the complete set of update notes available to browse this evening update 3.3 our next update after 3.2 arrives in mid to late february and features a refreshed scoreboard alongside further changes that have been in the works since we've returned after the holidays scoreboard refresh in update 3.3 we will refresh our existing scoreboard user interface with a new panel that showcases how players are stacking up across the server here's your first look at our work in progress so this is how the work in progress scoreboard looks at the moment we've still got that panel on the left which is in the game right now but then the big score board groups every player on the server together we can see the top 20 players it looks like that's always going to be there and then we can see the members of our squad the blue ones are teammates and the red ones are enemies so everyone is grouped together which i think is a bit confusing i'd personally much rather have it so you either get rid of that thing on the left and just split the screen in half like the classic battlefield 4 scoreboard or if it has to stay like this maybe just have team one on the top and then you scroll down and then you can see team two also there's no deaths on the scoreboard here either of course you can see your own on that one on the left but you can't see anyone else's deaths on your team or the enemy team for me personally i would remove assists or revives and replace it with deaths on there you can already see your own assists on the left so i don't really know why you would need to see other people's many players have different reasons as to why they'd like to see how many times teammates and enemies have died some like to compare themselves to their team other players and to see how they're doing are they improving some like to see it to know what kind of squad or team they've joined is it a squad that is going around fragging out or is it a squad that's going around just capping objectives it's nice to have the option to know for me personally the only reason that i care about seeing it there is if there's a potential cheater on my team or the enemy team in the past in battlefield games on pc like bf1 and bf5 usually i'll join a server and quickly check the scoreboard and if it's the start of the round and someone's going 50 for zero i'll just leave the server because there's a high probability that that person is cheating so it's a good indication and a way to check that for me it does actually say in the next tweet that the scoreboard will receive further updates beyond this refresh this isn't a one and done deal for us expect to see us iterate on this further once it's live in the game and we look forward to your feedback once this new scoreboard goes live in february next matchmaking preferences in all out warfare and or platform voiceover ip these are both still on our radar no updates on these two today but we wanted to reassure you all that these are still front of mind and we'll have more to show and share on the topics further down the line matchmaking preferences i assume that that's just picking a selection of maps that you want to play and you don't want to play could be that could be something else all platform voice over ip should have been in there since the start it wasn't and it's critical in a game like battlefield to have that especially for console players playing on their own or in smaller groups so fingers crossed it comes soon next xp in portal further to the changes made at the end of last year we've got more changes set to go live with update 3.2 tomorrow that will enable more servers and game types to progress on mastery and weekly missions details on this will be posted here later this afternoon they have already been posted and we'll take a look at them after this game performance this is a big one for me our teams continue to analyze the data available to us and develop further optimizations that enable the game to make best use of your hardware in every update we'll be delivering changes big and smaller aim to tackle the issues and improve your experience i think the quicker that they can look at the game performance and optimize it the better it was one of my biggest pain points biggest sticking points with the game when it released the low performance and also the inconsistency of it all because as a pc player this makes a big impact to how the game actually feels especially when you're playing on a high frequency monitor and your mouse feels inconsistent the frame rate drops you get more input lag the mouse sensitivity feels sluggish there are plenty of people out there with good top spec pcs that can't get consistent good performance with this game also this affects consoles as well i've only played a little bit of 2042 on xbox series x and that was like day one on portal a couple hours before it released on pc so i don't feel like i've got a good idea of what it's actually like there i don't feel like i've got an informed opinion or experience of how it plays but i've seen plenty of videos of the game stuttering on next-gen consoles many people on social media and forums commenting on how bad it runs and old gen consoles too on those 64 player versions of the maps fingers crossed that they can get focused on it soon unlock a few more frames per second and a bit more consistency in that department and then that thread ends happy new year we're hard at work now that we're back we hope you're all well safe and healthy stay tuned for more updates and we'll see you on the battlefield and then the next thread is about those portal xp changes that i mentioned alongside update 3.2 we're making further improvements on adjustments to how you earn xp when playing in battlefield portal here's a new thread with all of the details tomorrow we're increasing the permanent xp cap across all battlefield portal modes to 300 obtaining xp usually comes in bursts and our intent for this change is to reduce the frequency of xp bursts being capped during gameplay we're also changing how you progress mastery and weekly missions between created experience types what you can earn in each experience will now be determined by which modifiers you use and whether the rules editor damage health modifiers or ai are enabled and there's a little breakdown of that here in featured experiences so those are the game modes that are on the front page like when they have rush there for example or gun master they will be full player xp for master exp for weapon and vehicle attachment unlocks for ribbon xp and weekly missions will also track there and then there's moderate experiences on portal these are custom servers using all modifiers except rules editor ai or damage and health that will have a 300 xp per minute cap mastery xp up to rank 12 no ribbon xp but we will have access to weekly missions there and then restricted portal experiences using things like the rules editor ai or damage and health you'll have that 300 xp per minute player cap and then nothing else will be tracking so no mastery xp no ribbon xp and no weekly mission progress further improvements are planned for a future update such as a ui indicator showing if a created mode will have progression restrictions we'll let you know when they are ready to go these changes will go live tomorrow with update 3.2 and update notes will be available later today so i guess if you're looking to play on a portal server there'll be some indication there of what kind of xp progression you'll be getting before you join so you can make an informed decision and then finally if you're looking for more insight on our updates check out our thread posted earlier today that's the one that we've just covered and that's it for now i didn't want to wait until the patch notes were out this evening because that could be really late for me but that's all of the communication about the future of the game that we've had so far today those patch notes for later i assume that there's going to be some gameplay fixes in there some bug fixes they mentioned stability i don't know if it's going to be a massive patch i don't think it will i don't expect any sweeping gameplay changes in that mainly because they would have mentioned them in this twitter thread i think that kind of thing is coming down the line but it'll be interesting to have a look at those and break them down when they're eventually released let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for watching if you
