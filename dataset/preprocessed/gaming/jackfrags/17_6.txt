today we're back on battlefield 2042 they added rush on the new map i don't think they've done this before and it's actually pretty fun just a pure focus on infantry combat i do think it needs another set of emcoms though but i was playing with my mate stodd here and we were doing the medal of honor warfighter thing sticking together as much as we possibly could in a duo trading revives and focusing on flanks and area control with the k30 and mp9 smg both of those are just stupidly good still by the way and work great for this playstyle dare i say that the k30 in this game is as good as the k10 was in battlefield hardline before it was nerfed and i'm sure a lot of you guys watching remember that certainly feels like it at the moment one thing to note to really nice fps and hit reg on this game mode and map it's only 32 players and you can feel the difference i just hope it was like that on all of the other maps too with that said i think you guys will enjoy this one we went pretty try hard and played the objectives as much as we could if you liked the video leave a like and a comment below subscribe for more let's get it go for b yeah yeah right sides they're on the roof style to be got one on the roof hold on i'm pre-naming those zippers on dead you got b you're good there's one on the roof here i can see it oh you jumped off oh yeah i can hear more coming oh no yeah do you think they're ever gonna properly nerf those because they're so stupid um maybe i can get you again hold on i'm being head glitched oh and run this way are you running healthcare at the moment yeah i'm running health kit and then obviously i'm angel with ammo i'm going for b i still think angel's useful even without the the armor yeah all right got the guy that was shooting you from the left right he's on it thank you it's hardcore camper guys across the way on this red marker so by the way now they have a they have a little icon that tells you when they're diffusing it which i think is actually wrong really i'm saying that yeah it goes red when they're diffusing it it shows you a little red diffusion thing yes oh man i just got ruined by grenades hold on yes this is gonna be an absolute steam roll doesn't it i think so i'm down i'm trying to get here i think i'm kind of behind coming oh it was people he's absolutely railed the entire squad there i'm going oh yeah yeah well hopefully they're not already set up on a oh you can fly all the way in dude yes yes oh i'm on air with you with you with you oh this is beautiful i hear footsteps on my right clothes right i'm arming it here yeah watching it oh jeez needing it no go to left he left check my left yeah oh yeah good spot thank you uh i've got health here if you need it if you want to come to me i mean it's head glitching then there's two coming down i'm not save you why can't i save you i don't know that was weird i'll spawn on you they're pushing oh this is bad oh behind as well on the right i got one it's gonna blow anyway i think we got it yeah nice nice nice nice we held it i just flew straight in there dude yeah i know you got it there's no one there because that's the hard one for the grenades for the grenades i'll give you healing if you need it sure there you go there you go that's pog that's pog i think there's more in the stairs wait that's the that's that's the game i need another set come on i don't know why they've done that it needs to go to why i guess where would it go no it would go to the other room wouldn't it there's that whole other place um towards the spawn what i know i can't believe that that's no in fact i think that that last space is probably the most interesting the one that would be in the mountain on the spawn side yeah have you ever got a kill with a jet in this game i've never even flown the jet once isn't it because doesn't it share the same as helicopters i can't remember no it's separate but they're just trash yeah like i actually enjoyed like jets in bf2 and bf3 and four oh bf2 though joe come on completely broken you fight you just fired at the floor and had the aoe of like i don't know a truck it's like a house a singular house per shot where'd you go oh man nice anymore jenkins it literally is the face melter it's a good way of putting it i should have uh should put the revolver on and you can headshot that guy he's still up there there we go god i'm gonna go i'm gonna being shot in the back shot in the back oh yeah okay one by this again behind us again jack minus again got him got him no healing now though ammo down we need to move over really quick if i'm not using the bsv the range on that i'm here i think he's right around the corner no you're going to shoot us from like a weird angle can we get up the ladder there's a ladder is there not a ladder no oh i'm so screwed undead why is that because they're in this building soon we've got no healing i can hear them i'll distract trying to break through oh he came in the other way hold on i'll come get here no he's between me and you run out running towards the other door he's gone through okay okay okay he's on yeah he ran towards our spawn this is our little hovel hole there's a medkit in the corner there yeah oh thank you for you mate i'm sorry nine tickets jumping off got him it's fun to defend is it yeah i don't mind it because it's actually harder yeah just saw a red light and thought it was player they're actually a better team it could be okay to defend two tickets around was around five minutes 30 seconds defending are we defending no we're attacking okay i'm gonna arm there's a guy on the top of the on the top of the containers over here marks oh on it all right i got him ice you got him that was the guy i think check out some med stuff oh my gosh that killed me no you're on the ceiling sorry grenades they're kind of camping from the left the gun balance in this game is completely busted man oh yeah i mean there is just like 50 of the guns are insane and 50 are completely just absolutely dark and there's nothing you can do about it the jump kill finally b again smoke it's absolutely ridiculous dude oh yeah all right oh they changed it so it stops it exploding though because when 2042 came out it wasn't like that oh yeah he used to just do it anyway yeah it used to blow up but they've made it like bad company two star which is got on the roof i'll go for a i'm in i'm in size i'm above now might have the flank here maybe oh wow okay that's a lot more than i expected there to be there spawn on you if i can yeah i'm just holding the left side the right side they're all at the back here in that little room stud getting your teammate there hunting be firing the smoke and the smoke so i'll try and do my dive again stud there's a little drone you die already please thank you bloody has just sent that this flooded guy in our squad he just sent the uh quad bike off the cliff and he's one i keep going here all right where is where are you i've literally flown all the way through to be i was kind of sick they're everywhere putting healing behind you just in case i can smoke just that spot in front smoking am i going crazy okay um my smokes literally disappeared into nothing it just didn't it just didn't work yeah did you say that no i didn't see it i threw two smokes and they just didn't literally didn't spawn i am dead on the right me yeah yeah he's still behind him right it's clear there's a guy camping the roof he's dead don't worry about it try and get you these smokes are so useful one second no one really uses them though i'm gonna plan this up oh they've done it already that's a teammate he's coming he's landing they're all landing on you from above there's like five of them oh i think we're going to get it thing flammable yeah gg excellent that's a bit tough for that one i think defending again grenade on the outside of the building careful oh no the squirrel why are you over here he's on my body he's sea bagging is he bagging coming up he's dead no he doesn't know you're there he doesn't know the other the other one there i got him let me help you why is he tea bagging your

don't rush me out don't rush me yeah there's so many there's so many they're pushing left side i tried to get on the top okay so these might be all right then this might be a fight they basically came to us then like the entire team everyone was there i don't know how they didn't plan b though you know well they've done it now oh they've put a turret on the roof that's fun is it a challenge good can you go up here yeah um not that specific bit at the end here you can you know where that marker is yeah you can go out there okay one drop down i'm not even close coming wait a second on the cliff they've got you [Music] that's the k30 for you i've armed it um smoke the entrance so they can't come out something just yeah you're good you're good i think still at the end of the tunnel and this
