if you weren't already aware apex legends right now is running an event where they introduce new and interesting game modes every game mode lasts for a couple of days and then they move on to the next one at the moment yesterday and today the game mode over the weekend has been third person mode now apex Legends was not designed as a third-person shooter that's obvious you play the game it works really great as a first-person game but I have always wondered what this would be like to play in third person and of course when you've got competitors like fortnight which are also a battle royale title free-to-play and standalone you do wonder if apex could draw in some of that crowd by switching to a third-person camera so I've been playing this over the last day or so I've put quite a few hours in and I wanted to show you guys some gameplay give some impressions and also a bit of feedback about how I think this could turn out and how it could be better so when I first saw the trailer announcement last week for this I was like oh my god that's awesome apex are actually going to do a third-person mode there has been a third-person Easter Egg in the game before but that's all it was and it was just in the practice wrench this is fully fledged third-person you drop into the game with the squad of two others and have at it just as you would in the normal first-person game mode so like I said I was like yeah damn I really want to give this a go yesterday played my first round with a couple of friends and I did not like it one bit that was my first impression the game felt incredibly slow and I don't think they've actually changed the speed of the game at all it's just because of the third-person fov your character feels like it's running really slow at times it's not it's just how it feels and it can take a bit of getting used to also it doesn't look like apex have made any changes whatsoever to the gunplay or the animations here and with the game being developed for first-person I think third-person mode really needs some more attention there before the gunplay starts to feel natural you may notice the crosshairs too sometimes your abs and there's still a big gap in the middle but if you pick up a different scope let's say at two or three times it zooms in more but ideally you want to get a sniper scope or a digit threat because in this game mode if you've got a sniper rifle with a sniper scope you will get the full normal sniper scope and you zoom in and of course if you then keep yourself at range you can chip away enemies to your heart's content and be incredibly accurate while doing so and ask for the digi threat I didn't realize this to begin with but if you've got something like a peacekeeper or an R 99 which are both incredibly strong in this game mode with a digit Bret aim down the site and you actually get the first-person view there I suppose that kind of makes sense because what would be the point of the thermal aspect of the digi threat if you couldn't ever see people through smoke with it highlighted in red so those scopes are really powerful but most of the things can be really awkward to use at times especially when you first start playing but the more I played this the more I adjusted and I started to enjoy it I did write it off initially after a few games I was just like this is terrible it feels like all respawn have done here is put a third-person camera in and realistically I think that's what's happened as far as I know you can't adjust the side which the cameras on you can't adjust the field of view to make it a bit bigger none of the player animations have changed so sometimes you're looking at your character from behind and you think man that animation doesn't look as good as I thought it did when I'm shooting other people it seems to speed up and slow down at times too but I think once you overlook that and you start playing it more it can be quite satisfying but it's definitely a different style of game naturally when it comes to competitive games that have a third-person camera people are inclined to camp more and put their body and cover while seeing around corners it's called a cam thing it's a classic staple of third person games it's been around for years and years and now this is an apex that the pace of the game has definitely slowed down in my opinion on PC at least I haven't tried this on console I've just been playing on PC and you'll often get people camping corners waiting for you in complete silence and stepping out as you're running towards them rinse them down your shield and your armor and you'll go down quite easily and of course you are inclined to do that too you've got that third person advantage as well some people hate this style of gameplay some people love it and it brings me back to the old debate between pub G third-person and first person when pop G came out it was third person only inhabiting the first person and since then really that's all I've played because you don't get those situations where you can be completely hidden in cover yet gathering a load of Intel when you're playing first-person apex yes of course you can hide too and wait to ambush people but you just reliant on your sound and your knowledge of the game whereas with the third-person camera you can do stuff like hiding behind a wall see exactly where an opponent is strafe out and have your crosshair at exactly the right height and start firing at them before you've even begun to strafe out so playing defensively in third-person just give you a massive advantage another problem with the way they've done the camera dink is that it gets really messy in close-range gunfights especially in buildings I think it needs a bit more care and attention there some of the big characters - like Gibraltar and caustic they have a massive problem because they're that thick there that why'd they actually cover loot and they cover things that you're trying to do sometimes and I found looting in general in third-person was quite difficult - how it is in first-person I don't have a problem with at all there but in third-person I often found myself having to do really small micro adjustments to get my crosshair lined up on the thing I wanted to pick up also pinging items in general he wanted to tell you teammate that there's an extended light mag by pinging it you've got to be really close to it and get your third-person camera in the right spot before it will ping it instead of just pinging the ground and telling them hey we should go here also I didn't realize how much and how often your character does these idle animations as soon as you stop walking octane in particular just starts doing all these idle animations almost straightaway I'm thinking is I'm gonna look like when I stand still in this game I'm gonna stop standing still so there are some problems with this and I do wonder if apex will look at the plain numbers from this limited-time mode look at the feedback and maybe include it as a permanent or a more regular thing that's in the game and I've been looking at Reddit and social media really YouTube comments on other people's videos and it feels like this a big split on this game-mode some people just have tried it and they wrote it off they're like nah it's rubbish I don't like it it doesn't work but I feel like there's another camp that actually really enjoy the person mode in Apex and I think maybe if apex can afford to if they put resources into this into developing the third person game mode a bit more maybe working on those crosshairs a bit some of the animations for your character the looting system and also tweaking the camera a bit to make it feel a bit more comfortable and react better in those situations where you are indoors and it's bouncing around a lot maybe even adjusting the gunplay and the animations to make them feel a bit more satisfying and natural when you've got that done a person camera on but there is definitely a satisfaction in being able to see your character of course apex has a ton of awesome cosmetic skins for your character for your guns and when you can see them on your back in all their glory as well as that cool skin you've got and then you go to town on a squad and destroy them it feels good it's a different type of game and play style for sure and there's definitely something to this I do want to know if this is a test for something more permanent or is it just respawn having a bit of fun we'll see I think if they look at the player numbers maybe there'll be a big demand for this as a permanent addition we will have to wait and see for me personally in its current state I feel like I've experienced it now and I don't really have a desire to play it again rather than first-person mode until respawn hypothetically if they touch this up in the future update it and really separate it a little bit from the main game to make it more of a polished experience then I'll definitely come back and play it some more and also touching on what we talked about earlier because of the nature of battle royale games and the fact that you're pushed around all over the map in a circle that you can't control the odds are already quite campy and slow-paced at times because of the permadeath element no one wants to die everyone wants to win and that's exacerbated even more when you introduce a third person camera and I just don't enjoyed be ours as much when they're in third person and it is mainly because we've got that random element that forces you to move plus corner camping without putting yourself in any real danger and I think that apex it was designed as the first-person shooter it's a great mix of old and new in terms with the gunplay and the movement and I just really like how it is already I don't think it needs a third person mode but I definitely be up to try and get again it and when we spawn update this or attempt it down the line so now I'm gonna stick to the first-person though but you know let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys if you've tried this third person mode what do you think like it love it maybe if you didn't like it at first give it a few more games and see what you think then let's have a conversation in the comments below anyway just apex need this or is it just a bit of a gimmick with that said I hope you enjoyed today's video guys if you did do leave a like that really helps me out thank you so much if you didn't like it dislike it that's not a problem at all
