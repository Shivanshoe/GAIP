hog oh hello there fancy seeing you here this way where's um immediately you just killed yourself of course you wanna do you wanna play together should we play together can we play together since we're all playing the exact same game the same time oh this actually gave me a shortcut stored and i'm right next to you now wait you've gone ahead have you yeah just jump off the cliff okay no i don't want to i don't want to just jump off the right cliff right here yeah it was just shopping oh this place is called crawl no what's on offer just sold all of the rubbish stuff i've got 420k for some reason i don't remember having that much money um how much have you got tony i've got 46k did we get a load of money from something i thought you would be 300k at some point i popped in at some point i saw your three maybe i spent time yeah yeah started to join and say you got about four inches and stuff yeah you played with this yeah well you're actually like i don't know why you didn't come here he was just on discord the whole time i just wanted to listen in and you know find me the same sentence in fact perfectly every time yeah but we have to speak to this goblin huh we are the goblins tired of horse depression freedom though i am glad you showed up because i'm pretty sure i couldn't find my way out of a wet paper bag yes fighting for freezer tomorrow and rebuke that tyranny of dragon god vodka a dragon god you say hey yeah don't worry i'm almost there [Laughter] i'm pretty sure it's actually the one that just tiny tina it's the same voice actor i think so yeah i'm saying you're your character's voice oh yeah yeah i would agree that's why i wanted to change it once a week yesterday smash of all smurfs see that damage yeah some great references [Music] [Music] what um drop yourself yeah but it won't it'll be too high level wouldn't it well what are the level requirements on this that one's level 15. that was good that one's 18. no yeah i'm never that's the most annoying message at the train station isn't it see it say it sort it they say they're gonna reduce the amount of time that it's played though or something because people were so annoyed by it i think so i think it's it's good because you remember it it works yeah so there's got to be something to it see it say it sorted it's just like when you hear a song too much though that it becomes annoying like a catchy song damn it all the end times sneaky snitch will never be boring to me yeah it will always be as soon as there we go that song never gets old never i think tomorrow loves it more than yeah guys this looks like borderlands someone's already said that in the chat no way sean you've not been listening fancy magical machine these things run at you explode and then freeze sounds wait they run at you and explode and almost kill you instantly or they do to me at least that machine looks a bit too complicated vowel got a melee [Music] yeah i got it back here when i shoot a randomized barrel and it blows up seconds later yeah that's a great i mean it's an unbelievable banter i never see it coming it's an unbelievable banter volcanoes this is dublin goblin last week destroy the rock what rock i'm looking for uh it's over that way do we have to go up uh potentially a fine collection well how do we get back up now oh no let's get up there it's just one tiny rock oh yeah yeah that's it so you say you want a revolution there's more well you know now we replace this the goblin workers oh look at this lad the taskmaster oh my god he's got nothing on us blame him for the poison look at that come on smash him with a shotgun he's my belly yeah running for their lives there's another big lot there next to me oh yeah hp this guy's a lot tougher than last one i think nothing amazing oh apart from that insane weapon you gave me but that's level 15. start it taught us yesterday as well that when you get the dice you know the little dice that you can find yeah they increase your chance of getting better loot in the levels oh so we should have definitely found a way yeah yeah we found a few yesterday but not many 368 damage okay okay oh wow there's one they're in barrels they're in barrels i think you just shoot head maybe melee weapon does a thousand damage is that oh no capacity is sorry no this one on the floor i got confused it was capacity on something else rather than damage on the melee weapon you're looking for a jar up there [Music] i guess oh wow flying jetpack goblins horrible isis yeah there we go why is oh your character sounds like scuffed obi-wan that's why hello i've not been expecting you oh my god famous line look i have some gtfo training but i've never been in a real fight before ah but i can see the courage you possess you can do this anakin okay if you say so if you say so it's time to claim the caverns for the glorious resistance raise the gtfo flag what do you think gtfo stands for in this case um because oh yeah that's right it's right there goblin inside of forced depression no these are our team whoops that's obviously the only thing it means [Music] [Applause] [Music] they've got their belly buttons have um

wait a sec i just want to go and see all the legendary loo he's full of guns my god they're all legendary wow don't lie to me tom i can't believe i was somebody you've got a reputation as a liar don't bring it back please i wasn't just a little bit of a dark lord they all know the theme tube come on guys sing along are there any americans in chat that know what eastenders is don't look it up yeah don't google it don't cheat wherever you go no just don't that is my advice to you oh full stop yeah we have to go back to joyful roy you don't want to find out about ian beale and and phil mitchell maybe he's not over there is he and he's censored a very jack joshua roy he's not any senator no one's joyful that he's never seen this guy in these standards oh yeah he's one of the druggies those pearls belong to me so he's going to play don't move i'd love to do that return wait return them or give them to the pirate what do you want to do okay so decided to the pirate man we're gonna have to fight this guy now that's honorable right oh the shark was the one talking to us oh my god she just smacked out all the loot every stream you've said the word spaft it's his favorite word i think you did actually make the right choice there sod yeah because we've got all the best loot in the world yeah we've got a bad ending now there is no i don't think there is a bad ending it's actually the worst one we give um when you look at all the loot it feels like your fps goes down to ten but it doesn't yeah because of those i'll tell you why it's because those weird little panels are like 60 fp or 30 fps or something overlays i'm gonna leave all that i don't need any of that yeah it's a little bit i took a few bits of it overwhelming and i simply can't see why is it all just in one massive group like in firestorm when the loot is just like there you go have fun you know enjoy that dick yeah if they they fixed the loot that would have been it fixed that would have fixed firestorm yeah that's what brought everyone back the loot yeah great again love that all right where to well that was uh raises the lost shark done oh i get it 20 000 years under the sea oh like 20 thousand leagues under the legs basically the game is references that's the game fan service and reference of the game yeah it was star wars references yesterday there was a portal easter egg there was references to pirates of the caribbean there was a start the star wars like the thing smurfs pinocchio as we mentioned everything's a reference jack said you were supposed to join the force not join them yeah memories uh it's not far away this guy goodbye there good wow oh god smaller ones be gone um yeah you guys deal with that if you would aid me i would bid you to follow worshipers of the feral serpents [Music] [Music] [Laughter] do you have that's just in the game which is one of the characters i mean i believe it like we get it it's one of the villains we're gonna fight later well unless disney gets involved they might have something disney related is this new this is a new area this is cool did you play serious sam stop do you know what it is oh yeah yeah i played it yeah i know it was a good game i liked it it's about these i did play siri googling what it was about when it was thank you [Music] come on i played halo on playstation around us you're a liar i believe that longest ever no they've never done that mama was the kid at school who said their dad's a millionaire but he's you know yeah okay i'll tell my dad on youtube he works for the police station what was the best lie that you told when you were a kid or the worst life activities and stuff like rock climbing kayaking zip lines bungee jumping all that sort of stuff yeah right and um it was like a place that you went to every couple of years with the school snatching yeah like every sort of yeah um and there was like this one time where like a bunch of lads apparently went into one of the bathrooms in the showers and started launching bourbon biscuits at people who were showering this students yeah it also made a massive mess and was very embarrassing for the school and one of the cleaners complained and basically i know who did it but i wasn't gonna grasp right so you just said yourself now because snitches get stitches okay yeah so i decided to when they called like any witnesses or anyone involved come forward now or you'll get in very big trouble and call your parents and i was like well i wasn't i wasn't a witness but i know who did it so i just sat out and then suddenly i was called into this office without this meeting with the people who had come forward and people who were witnesses and they all said it was that i was involved you weren't like legit you weren't involved yeah and i couldn't like i couldn't um back my case because they're all against me and you realize that your friends are there so i just shut up and i was like yeah whatever and uh yeah they were willing to let you die my yeah they they let me take i fell on the sword willingly took uh yeah got me in big trouble but you weren't you didn't do anything you were just there other than a lie of why no no i wasn't you just didn't say anything that's not lying yeah but i was i technically new information so you withheld information from the police criminal conflict but i didn't yeah because it was like a day after and the cleaners were very annoyed over there and what was the punishment well they found my parents and uh [Laughter] did you have a good time then we had a great time yeah so lunch is pretty sure lunch for sure best weekend to battle and why is it called argos rock they don't [Music] i think i was about five and i convinced my i thought i convinced my teachers and my friends that i had my meningitis for some reason that's right i just wanted a day of school little did you know that you didn't know what ninja is yeah i didn't have a clue i just heard it on the news and it was like a you know a serious thing to have when you're a kid and then i just went to school the next day and i was like guys nearly dies how to manage [Music] yeah obviously i didn't know you know what it was

what's that one down there a what happened to my third weapon oh bye bye it's gone there never mind the blacksmith's over here if you want to do your upgrades oh yeah i need to do that where is it [Music] yes i see i have a skeleton key a certain little yellow robo-bro would like your assistance with his smithing gig it's not going well so far he's terrible at his job most things many upgrades many upgrades were made this day lucy clapton quest next and where are the shops the shops are down here and here we have the shops we can see tesco bustling with all its wires and waitrose a porsche version uh they're just really sweet i would say son hmm yeah you bite into the man it's just fluffy yeah no no no michael michael smacker it's called the waitrose okay it's called tesco it's fine well that's the thing with waitrose right every waitrose item is basically just a tesco's finest that's it yeah in price so you know you think yeah quality wise claim lost loot oh my god so much is coming out i don't want to ever press that button whoa i missed out on a legendary snipper not going to do this guys might be missing out on some legendaries you know i mean no i mean bruv now mine where are you tom over the blacksmith uh in like middle social hub i guess wait where are you which one are you you're not in the middle of it i am in the middle it's almost crap to someone like come up the stairs yeah over here oh here we go oh blood dl oh what's the what is that i know what's the legendary but it's level 12 or something so [Music] he just fires one shot that's a lot of purples fires are fish you got water a lot of purples i don't want them pathetic i go see my um my single shot legendary pistol one shot oh you mean like yeah fires fires a pitch of fish the jumper that's kind of cool what's the damage on it um 82. but it's got potential to hear like five or six times yeah interesting great that's right here we see a young story and jack waiting to travel the tomographics nice how do we get in here jack wait what can you travel now jake [Music] oh my god mine has like 17 arrows i want it my sniper rifle is a bow and arrow it also damages me yeah it's not great oh god we have to go to that mount crawl place again where we started so i think there's going to be a borderlands 4 probably yeah i'll race you start your e5 it'll look sick yeah this it'll be this is this is 3.5 yeah this is just a stop gap do you think they'll change the gameplay though um i just want more guns and quests people really like borderlands 2 but they didn't like the pre-sequel and then people kind of like borderlands 3 but still people still prefer borderlands 2. i'm stuck here i don't know i think they like the gameplay they just don't like the story the story was really underwhelming can you not get that yeah do you think they'll just make it like more free-form or open-world like we said unreal engines don't look at that real time ray tracing higher poly character models environments better lighting animations but in terms of gameplay though what you know what can they do because they can't just make borderlands 3 again well they kind of like can get away with that though it's like any other cod game like i don't know i feel like i've played this game yeah but you have to be like a die-hard borderlands fan like you're not already in it yeah you kind of have to have that past knowledge of all the other borderlands games otherwise the new borderlands game isn't going to make much sense to you i don't think i mean i don't really care for the story i just kind of like the gameplay everything is kind of like silly anyways yeah like i don't really know what's going on in the story this game except for we're in a dmd board well that's what i mean though but the normal board lands wouldn't be like this like this is just a this is this is a silly quest based around dungeons dragons yeah not an actual plot point with villains that you know you're not worried about the characters in this one because you know you're in a ball game yeah like the goal is to just take down the dragon lord like that's it yeah like tina's team turner is coming you're simply the best like there's no fear of tiny tina dying in this because she's playing a game what about teeny tiny pawns in her world will she die yeah tina tyner tiny turner thunder thighs thunderbirds like need to worry much about her where are we going how do we get down wait you're actually going the way you're going we have to go up and around yeah are we though yeah i think so looks like it's the other way no you're getting around okay so would you say that people are bored of the lands have you just got an echo button now permanently this is a perfect reverb just just for all those hilarious one once in lifetime jokes yeah that some would never repeat yeah again and again tom wishes he had my wits and charms one you're crazy all right let's keep going we don't need to fight the same mob but it's fun isn't it i'm just shooting everything yeah and you want the gameplay to evolve oh this is where we did the gtfo no it's just gonna be it's just gonna be cleaner movement like a cleaner borderlands experience and the hard way like um with better jump peaking in crouch slides yeah yeah do you think they'll be like some crazy ue5 multiplayer pvp fps games they've probably pushed the limits of the open world a bit as well no i mean uh like in general like what vehicles and madness more like bigger set pieces i think that's all that people really want otherwise they step out of the boundaries of what they are yeah i wonder why you did that [Laughter] thing is i kind of forge my forging resume i don't know how to spit magic items worth a day but i do know it starts with mining magic or you should really get that sneeze sword out mining and defending yourself from wild animals [Laughter] apparently i missed the legendary item back there but there we go is your fish good stuff doesn't work it's good against like lobby enemies big ones because i only usually hit them once and then it usually it's me oh no oh no oh no oh no oh dear oh dear i'm reviving you okay come on this way yeah we can just snipe from a bubbler there's a secret ladder though they don't want you to abuse that's just how the song goes yeah required oh are you going to keep playing the cycle sod like until the 19th you reckon i think so yeah i'm really enjoying it i mean um obviously the quests are getting a bit more like convoluted for no reason sometimes but you know like i s find six how long do you have this it's actually iron ore that comes out of it yeah i know but they yeah they launched themselves [Music] i think uh chat likes it as well so you know it's good good stream game youtube though [Laughter] did your video not do well um i think i think it's the problem with how it looks and how like i think you've got a good click through people watch the video they were just like it's not for me is it because it's not modern guns grounded in reality you know i don't know dude do we have to like hit something yeah yeah yeah you'll see little um things everywhere they'll be little you can just melee yeah we need one more oh my god oh my god the pizza's just begun it's down here box it's the only area we can find it i've got it yeah i think a lot of games like if they looked more realistic people would be a lot more interested in them yeah because they wouldn't be immersed same thing with west ham doesn't want to play at all because it's just like oh i don't even like he doesn't even like it at all yeah there was a few comments like that on my video like oh it looks like apex it's just apex then it's a mic it's like apex i think this game's borderlands actually not i think well it doesn't look like borderlands doesn't know what it's not yeah not by the same developers not the same this contact character it's not the one from the same one from borderlands different types yeah [Music] accomplishing things [Laughter] [Music] gun that does sound amazing [Music] the mountain is full of adventurers and kick the bucket while carrying all sorts of magic food all you have to do is get the good stuff and bring it back here then i can pretend that i made it and mastered whatever what is going on i love it when they like do a massive paragraph of subtitles on the middle of the screen right i'm at the mountains oh oh god i'm being smashed to me you can take it i got it the music it's tough i've been hammered in this area yeah i know i've already whacked it off somewhat oh actually we actually do need to come to this when we split off we have to get the ring there yeah jack there's the ring yeah oh it's the bracelet never mind where's golem why have you done this oh god apparently there's more here around here hold on i'm breaking with a fish i think he and all the promised stuff you love but for now this is awesome guys hey awesome like how do i get it see i didn't realize i was making a joke you made a joke there song wow there's like three left where are they where are they it's quite an ordeal anything with all in it anything with aura and it's funny now come on we have to go to the ice caverns or or we could go on a boat and use some hey um [Laughter] awfully cringey guys [Music] up there what do you want to do a side question this is another question of our operation no ignore ignore her for now let's go do claptrap push comes to shovel hey is it oh wait wait there's something up there how do we get up there maybe gravity left appears at some point scrapple hook it oh yeah that that's what will involve the gameplay this game works in borderlands 4 and then yeah i guess i just see the point oh god get him phoenix i'm just wasting all of my sniper armor to shoot one out one enemy i have to use a cypress sword if it's bad yeah i'm not sorry did we go the wrong way though good thing the cycles one is broken there's a little cutting that i missed there apparently go to ice caves yeah this way are you guys still fine out there a fine collection but i love when jack says this way and i can't see his name anyway you just come this way tom right follow follow my voice look at the arrow just follow my voice just look at the app this way this way tom oh my god oh my god um

bet this a ton of exploits in this way that's what they're trying to do they find the ways to get around the level that's possible jump forward there's one that's three or three we're done again completely okay that's home where's the enemies they're all dead eels we should all role play that we're inside this cave have have a reverb i don't have any good reverb settings though so i a little bit but you've got a noise gate on so it cuts off all right crank it up a little bit uh i mean it is literally maximum huh yeah that sounds pretty good it sounds like um oh okay that's enough of that okay we have to go up we have to get up there right over there right over there um there's all sorts of presets and like profiles you can get for the go solar in it like you sound like kylo ren or a dalek or whatever [Music] he's a great character so how does it go xlr make you sound like that i think just slurping up the loot like a hoover [Music] you've literally mastered goxillation he's a

just sounds like thingamajig from snowpiercer what's her name oh yeah uh the blonde one is it still worth watching that it's really good it's actually really good [Music] and i just got lost lost meet you along the way be on your god for the oracles i'm nearly there i've just been watching daredevil and punisher oh yeah what we've never seen i've seen daredevil season one or two before and i've seen punisher before but i just wanted to i haven't seen dead level three i wanted to really watch him yeah that wasn't a part of the mcu now yeah yeah but i'm surprised they didn't um adjust like the violence in them for the disney possible sense at all yeah and there's a few scenes in the punisher which are quite quite graphic i know very like if you if you go into that expecting the same disney plus like marvel you know the recent shows they've made if you have to sit down and watch that with some kids or like hey and here we go kids i know i'm babysitting i'm not the usual babysitter but today we're going to sit down and watch the final episode of the punisher season one oh he's got a chainsaw i'm sure they'll cut away from this oh god he actually just shared the whole thing and there's a great scene with some thumbs in the eyes it's brilliant you're loving kids that's the classic game of thrones that how do we get there's been so many times where i mean you've just looked at each other i've been like where's jack i don't know where he is what do you do you just disappear like i've been boosted i've been twisted oh god let's go oh my god this is cool guys oh sure yeah i'm sure it's good i'm strapped just you know when you can't find your friends how do you lose me so easily though i don't understand i just jumped off because like within 30 meters your name disappears yeah yeah i don't know i just i just go to the arrow though at the top yeah but it's it's never that simple there's some big enemies here started you charlie bit my finger but it's an amazon original i can't wait for that didn't they uh they auctioned it didn't they they nfc'd it no not investment down like who are you what do you do why would you do that harley bit me nfc i'm pretty sure they did and they sold it they've taken it down yeah because it's it belongs to the person that bought it i guess i don't know but why are they just like you know what i don't want to spread happiness what do you mean wait isn't this that hole that if you jump out off to get the dice on earlier i think they sold it for 500k [Music] good for them you can buy a second or third home there'll be a third home for charlie's thing they'll cut off his opinions i mean there must be like a uni hours on the right kids and he's probably absolutely sick of it he's like do the thing do the thing charlie put my finger on that one guys to go through that the one who's uh and his original video that he uploaded got copyrighted by youtube and some like some other person uploaded it and they're the one that make the money money for it okay good classic classic i love when that happens it's so fun so this is a boss fight i imagine the goop i i hated it even though it's for a righteous was that oh i can't do that ever again i'm sorry but you'll have to fight barkinar on your own champion don't worry y'all we can do it well you know it's just up ahead follow me all right come on then turns out to be i look forward to sleep what do you think it's going to be that's some sort of boss fight again yeah but like a goblin a fish i mean um i think okay it's going to be something it's going to be a lizard a lizard lizard lizard and then someone such a good effect that is it's great it's great for it to really send it home it does it does send the reverb wow that's a good shield it's even worse as if it couldn't get any worse it did mighty night mystical magics spread the word hello there game seems promising i mean it's more borderlands rhinos if you're into that you'll love it you'll love this it's like borderlands boots on the ground that's how i describe it hoots on the ground i have been forced into a west fight stunt i mean i i wasn't wrong it is elizabeth wrong it's well it's a type of lizard tom did you are you at the thing tom it's a type of listen in the in the goblins hole it's a boss fight you think to the death killer god don't fall down there jack you see this [Music] don't fall down tom will just jump straight into that stuff that's what he does it's kind stop stop stop that sounds so bad it was like normal make sure you've got your venom did this last time he was like oh this has got this guy's easy isn't he and then he leveled up he always does that and then we start playing against that diamond for seven hours what you know that guy at the very end of dialogue too is honestly that dying light it was the most chalk thing i played the whole year honestly it was i gotta think of a more challenged gaming experience i've had in ages like bunny hopping over the flames it was good that you did i realized that i'd made the right decision by not coming back because that was i watched the end and it was it was pain starting yeah i know oh we're gonna have to reset this entire area okay look at all the uh the goblins looking at us yes oh yeah oh yeah [Music] binks if cog to jar what really she just wanted the cog started they all want the conjunct [Laughter] you can't always give it to shown them you i think you deserve this more than me out of my way here we go this sword's way better and bigger i mean let's be honest guys if someone offered you 500k to sell any videos as an nft you know yeah i'll do it in a heartbeat yeah yeah yeah 500k in the bank yeah by the way tomorrow i'm sitting with yeah sure how much penny yeah i got there sick on ground slam launch a homing fireball forward that's what the cog does yeah it's kind of kind of bad but i'm using xlr for that um netflix special inside yeah that's what i did you just did that sample that i've been doing oh right you just used to go slower yeah yeah yeah and record hey [Music] how is this gun need to cleanse well that's the the final meme to see if there's uh there is one quest down there what's that what did i just do i just i just sold my entire backpack [Music] i can do that hey just keep it in your pants okay no this village has seen enough violence for one lifetime we want this i'm speaking to a goblin called bench oh no we've lost them again oh god i teleported you just just teleport look where i'm on the map and teleport okay i think we're going to go

play with family this if you're into the humor definitely my only other thought was to try and kiss him that was your only other thought that kind of thinking is why we're not allowed on heat on six anymore i can't believe it they will they're really goddamn real gtfo oh the revolution is nigh raven and the way these people speak except they're just pie that went seems like a total toolbox i think he might even just be appropriating the language well here's what check he won't get i'll be too busy fighting the good fight for goblin freedom pardon me one showdown would be cool are you gonna play the overwatch two beta yeah i'll check it out who sent you it's too risky snack is cool there may be more than one other way forward here favorite christmas holiday movie die hard wait what i'm free yes to the faction i'm right adventurer welcome to the resistance i like him back here right now stop i demand it oh god that's the scary voice the cave of dave thank you for not trying to kill anyone oyster and whatnot i have given you so many opportunities to be thirsty i'm putting all these cool glasses of water around and you're ignoring them like no i'm not dehydrated i'm fine wtf are you even thinking have you ever played an rpg come on i played many an rpg we could put this mass effect who's the best rpg by the way feel your weapon cave i shall now read from the scroll does anyone disagree it appears this is definitively not the seduction oh that smell is really cool there's a lot of damage ted stop reluctantly send me here to continue watching you if you're from sudstream you don't have to keep watching it's cool man oh i appreciate that thank you i'm just going to finish this quest then we're going to go to the final boss area like the end game in the show thank you so much for noticing skulls in here and in here what was my first rpg i don't remember probably one of those like uh choose your own adventure games on the acorn paragraph at the bottom of the screen reading anywhere between one and four novels i've never played the old republic that's why i'm really interested in the remake they're doing i have stood in this spot and guarded this cave for time immemorial except i personally remember seduced but i should like to kiss your lips absolutely not tunnel and how dare you attempt to tempt me i am a second bar beyonce yeah totally but i did learn something and that something is this violence really no problem most of the time it looks like the first crypt in skyrim it's probably a reference to it to be honest there's so much of that in this game yeah but the remake john that's you know the remake is going to bring it up to modern standards i hope that's how i'm really into it they do a good job of it that's it take it all down destroyed the fascists have fun in there yes infighting fascinating it's the cheeky kiss this big one i need some decent guns please i beg go on and get this the bench so have you retrieved the weapon we can live our peaceful lives without fear i hope they throw in the kitchens and got it john the only violence was done about some more star citizen definitely stephen large i need to play some more learn some more of the mechanics of violence but i am appreciative of your efforts nonetheless you may keep that wretched weapon be gone are you going am i excited about the new lego star wars of course man hey we were talking about that yesterday well i'm gonna go to the endgame area now i think we did most requests in here see what it's got hey mk how you doing wherever i gotta go over there man i wish there was a fast travel in this bit there's not unfortunately it's good fun mk i mean there's not like i don't really care for the story but the gameplay is fun i think they would have benefited from like calling it borderlands though because a lot of people just see tiny tina and they're like what's tony tuna but it's just a it's more borderlands three basically you know the amount of people that have come in here and have gone i didn't know this was a borderlands game like so many i think they failed in the marketing department in that respect [Music] or two shelves i tried fortnite since they removed building yeah i did apparently they're putting building back in though but i don't want it like like i actually quite enjoyed it with the building removed i thought they were going to keep it you know if they keep it with removed i'd play it more i'd play it loads because it's really fun the mechanics of fortnite are great you can ignore all the like metaverse stuff they quickly moved to cleanse the seven seas of piracy this was a resounding success until the privateers declared that there were actually eight the gameplay solid it's good for the navy roster to secure the new sea only to find the pirates were now insistent that there were twelve seas oh hope and so the game of worgen hair has continued for centuries with some claims as to the current number of seas stretching into the lower four figures depending on the pirates you ask and how much soda they've had that day [Music] do this so this endgame section's about an hour long apparently so it should take us right to the end of the stream see if i can get any better guns i'm sure i'll get some drops on this though 350 oh that's a 399 hello i'll get rid of that i like that new spell eleven percent to all damage dealt down that's a nice one sniper rifle magazine size i'm not interested in that all right then we'll go with this for now did you enjoy resident evil village yeah i loved it man that game was great so good such a surprise you missed thomas hat yeah it looks good in that bit how do i feel about the borderlands live-action movie coming out i don't really have much of a connection to the characters in the story of borderlands so i'll watch it like i don't i'm going into it with an open mind you know i like jack black as well so him as claptrap's gonna be quite funny i think see how i found my own i'm kind of new to a channel i only started where battlefield 5 came out cool man well thank you for sticking around yeah there's going to be a lot of battlefield this way lots and lots oh my god it's a big temple cleanse the well uh-oh oh no what was that enemy yeah these weapon types are really op in this and game one thing and that is usually a one-hit kill time for a spell my build is like really aggressive well raised are they around right where i want you and if i kill with that it recharges instantly so i can just spam it like that [Music] i'm all of them blando i'm going to be doing three four one five and 20 42. i'm just really fancy playing battlefield and a bit of variety you know i'm really posting the battlefield video since the like the broken shotgun one last week that wasn't really a gameplay video either you know it was like hey look at this funny thing that's broken and then they patched it the next day i knew they would i played one round on it and then that's it i recorded one round and i was done because it was super duper broken it's closer than it looks jump that x trap what does that do then twenty percent reduction damn okay oh that's nice so true i am incredible an incredible experience but i must not doubt i journey toward the dragon lord's pyramid in your past it's a borderlands game yeah it's not borderline well no i was too weak to reach it therefore be a three both john when i heard of the queen's death i journeyed here hoping the latent soul energy of this city would allow me to yeah the birth sniper isn't great is it try that instead perhaps magic the only reason i was a picked off i bet that's the dragon lord in disguise you must reach the old heroes beyond the inner wall the dragon lord is wells of sin to keep it blocked off if you can cleanse the wells you will lift the axes only by cleansing can you take down the barrier hexes blocking away does not divide us fate brings us together how's it gonna bring her head and her body back together i haven't thought that through yet there's gonna be a whole lot of killing here guys let me tell you they fought a zombie rifleman just a humble rifleman you know trying to do his thing i'm trying to do my thing and it's different to that thing oh i missed it was that one oh thank you mate not gonna say it sounds amazing doesn't it that's so cool see you later dave shorts what would you do if you want a youtube sensation well i wouldn't say i'm a youtube sensation time to chad but i think i would either be making music or i'd be a like a video editor or i'd be doing something in film or movies those you know i think those are my other passions that i would have if youtube didn't take off i would have explored that some more and i don't you know i think i would have liked to end up in that kind of space definitely another creative industry i like to make stuff if i'm not making stuff i get bored and then i just like what's the point every single one of these is indispensable here we go next one damn look at the damage let's go smooth combine this game not enough damage for the ones with shields hey bridget what's up you play an instrument i used to chris i got grade 8 on piano and violin i learned from a very young age and then uh i quit i stopped going to lessons and stuff when i was 16. i had a choice to go to like music college or music university to get the next you know the next thing the next grade whatever it was uh but i just didn't enjoy doing it at the time like i was more interested in being a teenager and playing video games and i quit uh my mom and my nan were really really upset with me but you know i'd prefer to follow something that i'm more passionate about and that was video games and turned out alright i don't have a favorite movie okay you can't pick one can you surely how do you pick one that'll never catch on thank you jonathan yeah this will be the last stream uh of the week i think i don't want to do too many streams on youtube you know i've done four in a row for this game they're all part of my sponsorship with epic though you know um but like i mentioned the rest of the week's gonna be battlefield videos or if anything surprises us anything crazy comes out then you know whatever that is i miss her no i wasted that hey lauren how you doing you want the heart once not what everyone else wants indeed it's quite smashy [Music] feeling the way forward yeah i think i'm done with these hexes now this gaming memory i've got little pockets of memories you know skeleton army isn't the same as what mortals deal with we don't have to worry about food water sleep or transportation like i say i can pick like playing goldeneye with my neighbors every saturday because i used to my mom and dad are divorced so every saturday i used to go to my dad's house and he had the nintendo 64. so we would go around and play like mario 64 mario kart goldeneye and then the neighbors kids would come around and we'd do four player like with me and my brother um playing metal gear solid for the first time that was you know that'll stay with me some of the things in that like when you put the controller down and just psycho mantis makes it vibrate like guiding the nikita missiles find sniper wolf those things are the worst zelda ocarina of time coming out of christmas and just playing that for 80 hours for the whole holiday before going back to school um counter-strike just thousands of hours like that was like 1.3 1.5 instead of being out at summertime i was just in playing counter-strike just repeatedly over and over again getting usb headshots and playing dust and dust too battlefield 2 battlefield 1942 going to lands playing that with friends flying around in a everyone on a different gunner seat and then like the modern combat mod came out or desert combat whatever it was called playing that lows atlan battlefield 2 flying around in the black hawk i could go on i've got so many like little pockets of memories for gaming they'll stay with me understood what soul energy was they designed the city itself i mean i can go back further than that like paper boi master system or playing sonic on the uh the sega mega drive or echo the dolphin when i was a kid since you know streets of rage golden eyes all those games just goes to show no one stays the master forever i think a lot of the memories for gaming though stayed with me are the ones that when you have an experience that you've not had before in a game like more recently i would say something like what's left a profound effect on me like the intro to the last of us uh god of war in general awesome game this guy again getting health off me or something [Music] beaming me how many health balls has he gotten though evil shall never you dead yeah [Music] lemmings you remember lemmings like i used it when i was a little kid i used to play it all the time animal tournament loading up facing worlds and just playing against bots with a sniper rifle for like 50 minutes at a time it's those it's those moments you know those formative gaming moments that stay with you the most when you have an experience that you've not really had before those are the best ones you're quite a little killer aren't you oh my god traps i'm just gonna check my loot because i feel like i've got some stuff there that's just higher damage more crits though i don't want to use the melee though as in like a melee weapon hey tom looks like three movies are coming out next month which is some of the hedgehog 2 fantastic beasts and morbius i'm interested in more sorry not more because i'm interested in fantastic beasts the most and then sonic two second and then more be a certain i think more of this is going to be terrible you're modding for n64 hdmi output that'd be cool uncharged series is my most favorite i tried two is the best for me chris paul was really good as well though hey tommo service is still chalked uh did you bring the thumb bots tomorrow always brings that before you that's what he does god's still doing so much damage that it's that sniper that i just got isn't it heroes of their own stories but they never lived up to their namesake they just played her game and went through the motions because that's exactly what she wants they're just thomas all to counts there's nothing down there was that take these creations of mine they exist only to do my bidding and when they fail i'll just make a hundred more no i didn't use the cheese that was a good boy destroyed the dragon lord's creations what the hell that was rude i'll take you all oh that's the sniper it's a full auto sniper what okay tom your message just got uh hidden because you weren't naked oh there we go mod frank just fixed it cool sound oh no shut his eye off magic left reach right where i want him now this is this is serious anton this is what's happening here oh oh now are you ready why was he trying to jump in the purple goo i don't know but why shall i slay there's a big lot in there you stuck there what's the alternative on this one she wants you to think you're special one of a guy do you even have a name fate maker has anyone ever said it has she yeah didn't think so now that's more like engine five i think unreal engine five is leading that right now apparently frostbite is just really difficult to work with ue5 looks great they've got some great destruction on it as well you know i mean you can probably compete with frostbite we'll see okay newbie to the hall of heroes the hall of heroes have i got a million yeah i've got a million wow i'll buy that for a dollar gear check that increases my mag size that's cool i like that spell don't get rid of that pop it in there for now so that's cool when i reload that it turns into a mind that bounces around and explodes do you like star wars way too much bridget an enormous arcane device has been erected before the hexed entrance to the hall of heroes it's got a fancy name with a lot of symbols but basically it's a giant sweet-ass magic laser that you can use to blow open the bears this speaks to me hey those guys are hanging out around our giant sweet ass magic laser kick their asses i'm in danger kill the laser guards i mean the gun damage isn't that great bounce i just like keep throwing it out i don't really see its effectiveness to be honest i might change that i like this one though [Music] ice damage this arcane device was designed to amplify magic to its limits my entire youtube just gave up you will cast the biggest stupid spell ever cast then we're gonna need some super duper dispelled room and you shall find them to the eams and wiggles i'm not sure about this one it's a waste of money bipod what does that do really slow but maybe more accuracy or something check attack my minions or tag my minions when's your beethoven debut i don't think i'd do that tony it's not for me i get why people like watching it though it's interesting will you be watching the new doctor strange yeah it looks great grab a pen though arcane device is supercharged with the spell energy hope it's super duper charged hit the activation room let's fire this thing it seems too rng though my spell is ready [Music] the entrance to the hall of heroes finally hey i i just want to say that i love you guys and i'm having a great time playing with you me too so are we don't hate me why does she think people here i can't do it we don't have the power captain [Music] oh thank you faith that's very kindly cheers cheers for the five what's your expectations for the kenobi series i mean it's gonna be great to see uh hayden christensen back uh and of course you mcgregor i'm i'm looking forward to some surprises along the way a bit of darth vader you know i i mean i watch it regardless of like the reviews or whatever just because it's star wars i like to watch all the star wars i've got high hopes for it but you never know with these things so far i mean i've enjoyed mandalorian season one and two i enjoyed boba fett although i didn't like it as much as the mandalorian but the episodes with the mandalorian in were really good the second episode above that was really good all the greatest legends [Music] yeah we'll see well not all of them what's that they say no rest for the wicked we nearly finished it yeah familiar witty and for a moment you feel hope the butt stallion but this is not your is the doctor strange movie good the first one is yeah it's really interesting it's a bit like inception i care about nature oh you hate that is that just constant pain for this boss can i just keep it unlocked by using this oh my god he stops [Music] yes oh no come on we can do it critical damage he's doing his thing be gone it's actually got the butt stallion's head on it i think it does i'm gonna keep that one on low health just in case i go down oh mama cool oh i'm over here everywhere [Music] is it's got more health no it's got a blue health right now [Music] oh god it's ads oh god is there any way to avoid that i would avoid that maybe if i do a slam above it or something okay you yes my plan worked [Music] back in business i don't know how to avoid it [Music] are you really so eager for distraction what if i do like a slam over it or something so you stood up and died [Music] it could never be her that twists good things into monsters it could never be her fault only i know better let me show you [Music] yeah we're nearly done tomorrow i think this is towards the end read the prophecy what oh okay so that's if i wanted to get some ads back to kill if i went down i could spawn some i see i completely missed that mechanic those scrolls weren't prophecies i wanted to show you what she did to me what she's doing to you all over again you know okay this is your first time playing right i mean yeah who would i play with everyone else i know is dead what's it called bunkers and badasses it's a fantasy game a place where you can be a hero where your imagination can change the world [Music] that's perfect but first we gotta make a character tell me about your fate maker there's so many do with a heart full of fire and dreams full of dragons magic most powerful hero that everyone wants to be friends yeah i like it thank you hey this is probably dumb to say and um it's just really cool to play a game with a friend because i haven't really had one well let's go make some more tina i want to make this an adventure you'll never forget it feels like something lost long ago has been found again it feels like home you reach the inner chamber of the obsidian cathedral the sword of souls sits before you now this is a big choice so he takes it and he blows up [Music] [Music] uh he just blew up thousands of people don't you think that's evil it's not evil this is stupid i'm not playing this anymore you know what i'm gonna be the bunker master and then i'll make sure all the heroes win tina wait the fate maker is alone abandoned for a crime he never chose he's never chosen anything he begins to think for himself no more dice more fate no more masters he i dream of dragons and magic i awaken my heart filled with fire and purpose resurrection i am reborn the dragon lord do you still believe there's a choice fate maker there is always a way to deny evil i hoped you could see the truth i'm not evil she just writes me this way well come on then if you insist on being a hero there's only one way for this to end one task remains ascend the pyramid defeat the dragon lord and take back the sword of souls is there uh no i've got no idea what's going on stephen we're in a game of dungeons and dragons or final boss tiny tina is the dungeon master everything's everything i am i am because of her i was her where's the epic glute come on i'm endgame i should be getting the epic glutes gearbox and i'm not i don't i

image in my head right now oh crap tapped out that was close did you play the witcher games i played the original and then i played a bit of witcher 2 in a bit of witcher 3 i didn't complete them [Music] that device isn't even important uh look that's not right weird um actually the dragonlord seems terrified of you destroying the device minions protect that device at all costs wait how did
