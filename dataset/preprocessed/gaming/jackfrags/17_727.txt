Call of Duty warzone has a lot of battlefield DNA in it it reminds me a lot of battlefield 3 at times with how much chaos you can create and all the crazy sandbox things that you can do and I searched myself and the guys I've been playing with have started to introduce as much of that strategy into our gameplay as possible for example it could be something like hitting a long-range sniper shot on a helicopter pilot oh that hello there I got him or even stealth takedowns like this go jack goes I love that and as a personal challenge see if you can win a game of war zone with a takedown like we managed to yesterday are we going for the melee again we've got it don't we let me rude not to these must be downhill isn't it could be up there I guess he's late I'm gonna stun go get him Jack they're sending it out of zone yes we get we get us good job but more recently we've discovered that getting in a helicopter hunting players down and attacking them from above with RPGs on either side is an incredibly fun way to play now on the top like yeah posit ourselves ha barukh one down do down teamwipe oh my god round two all right we already got 38 seconds to complete the missile strikes he's on the move or you might be that by they're on the move in front in the in it one down no confirm firing two down that's guys hot running that's guys running in front of us it where well now GG come track complete oh god there's a car coming is there yeah game game attack we got what up Yugi oh I fell off and he announced it okay gallop down let me helo spine that's the target oh all right attack above us it gates knows that saying that close close all right he's gonna read one more than one friend okay doc ain't sure looking box -
