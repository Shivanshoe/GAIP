hi everyone and welcome to call of duty warzone caldera the map is now live with 24 hours early access and we're going to be jumping in today playing with study tactical brit and westy first couple games are going to be with stodd and lackey because i'm not sure that cameron's got his pc set up just right so we're just weighing on him for a few more minutes but we're going to jump into a game just in a second thank you for all coming along tonight really appreciate you guys being here if you enjoyed the stream or the video make sure to hit the like great way to help support me also a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one i am a cod partner and if you guys pick up anything in the store like the battle pass or any blueprints or anything like that do consider using my code jack frozen caps and i'll get a bit of a kick back from that so with that said i've made a couple of weapon loadouts i don't really know what's going to be good or bad i've got a few ideas a few suspicions but the only good of max leveled at the moment is the stg so we'll see how it goes see if the lads are ready [Music] i'm ready to join yeah come on jackie join the ball let's go let's go get in the game oh look it looks just like you jack oh it's what's there [Music] that looks yes yes it looks exactly like you in fact i think they might have used your lightness chad stop you look like psycho mantis from metal gear solid that's what i was going for i was going for um odd and rose skin in the past interesting i'm hoping i'll blend in quite well i mind it's the bright blue gun but you know i can't really sort that out is that on the store that one lucky or what battle pass i think operators victory cannon blueprint i haven't even looked through any of it like i don't i'm so confused there's so many weapons so many things do you have vanguard loadouts because otherwise you're wrong uh i've made one vanguard loadout lucky that'll do he'll be fine i'll do it's the automaton and the type 99 yeah so that's a banger he'll be fine okay i don't really know why they opted to go the whole vanguard quads for a day i'm guessing i don't know it's very interesting um like we said though because if you yeah stop sorry if you don't own vanguard you can't play at the moment what's the point in them having the normal beyond well turn your air down it's all outside oh yeah yeah the bar's still insane from the event right guys i am i'm 15 gig away from joining you see one game you think we can get in i'll play really badly westy so we die that's fine yeah lucky i've whacked out the the 60-foot cable yet that's good jack my pc still won't accept the game that's weird isn't it even after a full reinstall it won't it just like it goes nope not allowed to play it just comes up with an error message everything's having performance issues with battlefield 2042 as well yeah it'd be interesting to put that on this other pc and see whether it plays any better but um no i'll probably be about 15 minutes so yeah you guys get a game in and then i'll join you i'm starting to wonder if one of your xmp profiles is booked or like training is unstable might have to have a word with pc specialists about that because they're the ones who did it i've literally literally haven't touched it i'm a sticky one still i mean i mean the thing is is i've got the the 12 900k sitting there so once the motherboard arrives so you're gonna build the mother pc yeah with the ddr mothership yeah the ddr5 ram let's take it all over guys thank you for tuning in first game live on caldera

until the first though that appears but yeah arsenal's good gear there's lots of stuff it's actually surprisingly dense i'm surprisingly dense i think we all are really um so wait because the the plane is tilted when you rotate the camera the mouse movement isn't correct i don't know the way i'm tilted after this jack i can't jump let's go okay we went for quite a safe drop here then oh wow oh hang on i'm nearly dead already oh good what a great start my gun sounds like i'm slapping water yeah he's going for you jack he loves you i don't i don't like that yeah he's he's really good at the

one rule okay we're going to start again yeah it's going to have to be back there well we're late with the beef backing lucky i'm afraid yeah i'm going to be um unfortunately i'm going to be beef backed there's so many people well i mean i think there's a lot of people here as well i don't know why so many people landed in it i don't know i don't know why this was supposed to be this way jack there's like ten people yeah i'm gonna die [Applause] there you go [Applause] he's just trying to pre-flight the middle middle i think can't see him yeah middle mill nice lucky good job ost tv tv are you still in there starting them new map same pain steven webster exactly it's fine we're living the dream no ground um are you safe there stud uh well there's no there's no there's no more things

trials huh i've got a double barrel shotgun and a pistol good there's a willy's jeep here i've got a fausti oh god the noise no precision airstrike [Music] oh the audio on it's uh a little bit chalked guys i can't hear you the vehicles are a little bit so loud what the hell can you hear this vehicle coming by sorry what was that star like i'm just coming over i think there's a plane stop stop it is a vehicle by the way are you here are you oh thanks for killing me that's great this is choked i'm sorry okay i'm gonna go get some get some cash starters i'm going to go get some cash so the vehicles could kill the teammates then for the first time that's great that's that's that's just ideal that's back isn't it yeah i don't know how to feel i'm sorry jack for trade i think is the life i mean you didn't used to be able to do that in the previous map so something's changed it's a live mythbusters episode yeah it's stunning it's sticking with the vehicle and he meant to what i meant to do is just drive it into the corner of the room um this is just how it goes down in world war ii apparently the vehicles are only firing on yeah i feel like i'm gonna get some sort of war-borne disease running through this damn okay betrayal and that's all that matters instantly got killed right um i've got enough money go back to the buy lucky there are there are men in mines no no i don't care a valuable lesson has been learned today scotty yes indeed uh maniac tomographic legend kieran thank you andrea thank you for becoming members guys it's very kind of you appreciate that well this is good it's a good start we're back on warzone live streams we're gonna have fun you know it's okay what's up tactical scottish rob hickman hey adu jeremy thank you for coming along guys is fps good yeah it's really good dingbo yeah it's good right then right then okay going live hello guys remember jack there's a edit feature on youtube once you're done yeah but i mean with great power lucky comes great repo stability i think it's it takes about 10 years to edit a live stream on youtube if it's longer than an hour so thanks for your edits we're processing it we'll be back shortly we'll be back tomorrow a week a week later guys it's still not changed there's a bit of loot here see in a week now no one's got their loadouts yet remember that so even even though even though our team killed we're still fine guys even those stods stack the odds against us um i've got a pistol here play here can i rob the plate [Music] does anyone know people are asking in my chat did they actually add an fov slider for console or not no apparently not it did that's a shame no i don't but this is the thing coming soon maybe on pc you get more frames what do you mean on this map well you get more frames with a higher ffv and warzone uh something to do with gpu load i can only presume that they're doing some sort of magic foolery to make the game run well i just saw one it just has on its own and because they're doing some sort of magic tomfoolery to make the game run well in reality they can't do the fov slider on previous gen x-gen probably it's a piracy thing then the thing is why give i mean they have to have it on pc don't they like people would go nuts if they never had it on pc uh someone's already died here because they're gears here okay i mean i literally couldn't play this game without an fov slider no chance i'm dropping a play box this is the automaton the one i had in the event had no recall i mean that one's got no recoil as well so that's okay that's good that's what you want oh it's up the hill there i just threw a guy there cracks ah he's gone well i i put a suppressor on my mind doesn't sound very good have you guys got any um that's pathetic have you got any sign primers i could rub yes i do again oh yeah yeah are fair thank you hand up there [Applause] you go wow he's just that was an assault rifle as well right i don't know he absolutely wrecked me no it must be a sniper mustang top of the hill still i can see them you can actually see their heads see creeping over watch out jack right there two of them i don't know i think it might be futile pushing this should we disengage yeah yeah just run off down the hill yeah we i wish this game had a wingsuit does this not feel very pubg-esque i mean like they have a very similar map so that one they brought come on i mean i forgot how to play this game attack sprint yeah i have to actually crouch slide counts jump count if you haven't played for three hours and your fingers don't then you're doing it wrong you sure that's not gta san andreas cheat code stub it's the true way to play this game oh this is the game coming towards this yeah right here right here get him sound i didn't go anymore he wants him once a month [Applause] another vehicle another vehicle to the right of it oh that's an a8 yeah he had to what's this yeah i mean yeah why not it's getting a fight i mean look if you want to rap him we can wrap him up the vehicle here this one this one this one this one trust me trust me one the right only this will have more people on it what about the guys on top of the hill though i've been beamed from here marks [Applause] oh lucky's almost dead i'm being shot from red red marker i need something something are you about to get precision i can't hear anything [Music] where they're all on the same hill side as you jack i don't see him i'm dead one dad's got the one believe me he was right here jack marked oh i'm being chased i'm being oh i'm being shot by another guy hold on where's he jack i'm there i'm stuck on the hill hold on just up on the hill where i was literally on the hill there okay hold on yeah i've got a problem with my pc i've changed my mouse as well like it just keeps aiming by itself i don't know why it's doing it i can't see this guy using the same usb port jack i literally changed my mouse camera [Music] [Applause] yeah i don't know why station that's all i'll say is maybe if if it's the same usb port it could be a bit tainted no it's a different usb port it's a good question how did i go down and i still had armor on don't know maybe you got run over oh god they haven't added those rounds that like avoid armor or something is there a new season pass today yeah it's gone live okay so i've just claimed wait who am i getting up by the way whoever whatever if i can get both of us okay okay yeah yeah i just claimed all my free tokens on the battle pass and it's put me to level 65. yeah i was like 40 something i mean that's great once again uav i don't know if we're safe to land there again i can buy you loads of armor plates if you need him i mean i might risk it for a biscuit but i'm not sure i've literally just done a fresh install of windows as well so i don't i don't understand what's causing that we got a guy right here guys on the map right there on the map on that red marker i spawned in with fists what i don't even have noises are gone uh do you want this you take this assault rifle thank you i feel a bit disconnected from the game it's weird he's right here by the way that guy's literally on that marker on that marker i just did feels a bit floaty yeah yeah do you just die i'll keep an eye on you guys uh on stream where's lucky he's on blue marker now i'm here somebody's seeing me i've got no ammo man i dropping dropping the check thank you get free style get free stuff right slides uh why not yeah i mean you know i'll thing okay another team as well well i'm alive [Applause] give it up stop give up all right i mean give up give up give up give up he's there the whole team pushed down the hill now lucky's right there are you not getting any parachute sounds i'm not getting any photo shoot sounds either well that was god awful um i mean so we saw one team we shot them and that's it i got downed even though i had armor i'm gonna try because i've got it in wireless mode i'm just gonna try plugging it in and see if that makes a difference like that well you know what to do jack what use a controller get the controller out get controlled from the lads potato frags when i was up on that hill stop like i was trying to shoot the people but it just kept aiming in and aiming out so i'm sorry i couldn't i couldn't really help at all i'm sorry no no i didn't do anything either i was like i was between both of you i couldn't see the guys i need to take my suppressors off because they're i think they're useless this bar that i've got here so i can't use the heartbeat sensor then in this game mode no i've got a panel can i join a lobby you can join now yeah are you ready not allowed i'm not allowed apparently that's why try now yeah yeah just um open it up and i'll join there you go i think i can come in now there we go first day teething there we go i'm the only one who doesn't look like a vanguard player fantastic i'm guessing i have to change that no uh i don't know you just have to [ __ ] vanguard skin otherwise it will change it one more time you get a random one yeah there you go i'm i'm a bush west have you got your um have you got a vanguard logo that's getting sick what the hell uh i don't have a vanguard oh i do have a vanguard look at that i'm a ninja that's the new rose skin i've got what i've done i don't think it'll blend in in this man yeah i'll be all right there's lots of blue water isn't there as long as you've got vanguard loadout fine i think i've got a vanguard smg fully maxed which oh i mean that was a uh a rough first game there i've had this issue with with my mouse where it just right clicks by itself and i've changed the mouse and it's still doing it so it makes me think that it's something to do with my system like windows install or something i don't know if anyone chat has ever experienced that before and knows how to fix it like both of them the mouse are wireless but i've just plugged it in to see if that makes a difference um so we'll test this game see if it does it uh vasil thank you for becoming a member you're on toggle name yeah i use toggle jazz yeah i've always used toggle it could be the usb port i don't know whatever we'll see [Applause] check your gear and weapons is ricocheted out yet ricochet is out in asia and pacific so they say that it's been it's been on the back end for a couple weeks in normal war zone but they're rolling out the colonel anti-cheat to asia and pacific today i think and then other regions will get it like later on so it's not in europe and us yet so i don't know why they're doing that maybe they're just like testing stuff not sure [Applause] [Applause] did jack just make the battlefield sound what does that mean rich [Applause] i had that once with a logitech wireless adapter and it was the adapter losing signal i'll just replace it though matthew so maybe maybe it is the usb port which one have i got included into i'll try if it does it this much i'll just try a different usb port because it could be that but i've got it wired now so we'll see how it goes it's a brand new mouse as well i thought my old mouse was broken but obviously not it's a different problem thank you james b uh gamer master thank you for the two months let's go where are we going i don't know literally literally straight down lucky literally straight down early drop is it happens i mean i don't know how this is going to go but let's go home you can put your [Music] there's an elevator here is it just oh no i thought it was a dead end um a matter of time a giant a dead a giant dead this building's massive what the hell and there's no gun there's no guns in it jack there's no guns it's the cinema and again do you want a game show it's a star trek song that's why they show all the old propaganda movies oh uav boys you ready yeah there you go and there's no one here having all right propaganda having a propaganda found a plate yet where are the planes now there's a brand here the brand's quite good they disabled the planes oh no no no no no no no no no i don't see anything yeah i just didn't i thought there was like when we did the capture event there was way more than that dude there were like 20 on the map there were loads i wonder if they just increase the number to make it like you know so we could get in them easily yeah maybe maybe double barrel shotgun thing what the hell let me get the golden one yeah get one of those holding one loads of plates around in me ah just carrying on my tradition of not plating up fantastic is he mouse fine now jake i don't know i plugged it installed instead of wireless and we'll see if it fixes it are you still using the super light or did you go to the other one i did have the super light but i thought the issue was the super light so i switched to a new g pro wireless but it just did it again so that's really odd you know this one whatever could be a usb port on my pc maybe maybe when you said you've done a new windows installed it's not a new pc same same competition i'm in danger i'm in seville are you in danger yeah he's in danger i'm coming danger cow let's go [ __ ] beam you may be a significant distance from us i mean fine me and jackal we're a little we're a little far away in one grand whoa there's a guy right here on me behind this car he's a man below me get together we need to get together man i'm literally gonna die if i don't he's right there i missed him unfortunately where's the one near you cam he's in the building with me now he's in the staircase just one yeah i think it's just one i'm not seeing him again lucky he's below me i can't throw me off the roof i don't see him cam he's on the back side on the staircase he just uh lucky you should parachute off the roof and just go towards um wesley and jack that's all right i've got a shotgun oh yeah but if they if they push me they're running there's a tram yeah jack you can get on it have a little ride i'm just going to come to you oh my god that shotgun was a two shot i actually heard his um i actually heard his parachute somehow that's impossible stud i know turn your cheeks off give him a chance guys the shotgun i just used was a two shot oh no no no were they full armor they were full armored and it's it's the auto it's shotgun a pump action it's fine don't worry i'm sure it will get balanced i think there's going to be a lot of things that i'll have to tweak pretty quick yeah i think there's going to be a lot of broken stuff i still think there's someone below me i called a guy that for some reason parachuted out of roof and just came towards me how long is the fuse on this uh it's like five seconds i think it's pretty long i've got a precision which is actually like a strafe with a actually more of an audio um it basically ruins everyone's audio in the area so it basically ruins you area of effect audio denial if you ever wanted to creep up on people just call one of those and no one hears anything we have a lot of money i know we can't buy a loader yet but yeah it's weird not being able to buy loadouts well it'd be nice if i got into a gunfight you know i'd probably change that i reckon do you think i mean i think if we move i think if we move towards the uh zone uh towards the buy station i reckon we might get some action try the sbt that's my current entire hearing shots i'm hearing shots to the north shots are north yeah it was like in this building it sounds suppressed oh you want the cheeky yeah yeah it could be anything i mean we should probably buy some uavs really it could be delete the entire lobby as a contract oh yeah we should but there's no shop there is there there's a shop here over me nice stg there is people near us in this building i think you've designated honestly and lucky is a mile away guess i'll be ruined okay you will be in severe pain oh mate you can properly hardcore parkour yeah you feel some of the buildings yeah you can really smash your way through is this the little tram this is the tram area is this where you start one circles the map this is the water like the gracie autumn is it on the back it's on the back side of the building it's here all right so by uavs uab's are 6k now as well gone over there dropping the cash there again i'll go uav call in that's a capital finish all right no one here here here here on green on green there's a man in the building there's your loading and it's two there's two i'll be looking for that guy yeah yeah be for the green boy i'm gonna pop you over here i'm waiting on recon is he on the race it might be they're just weighing over there yeah there's one guy in it he's one he's one he's one he's one guy he's one guy he's he's on his own he's on his arm they're over here as well over here on green right it says swiss ots9 but that is not what is in that loadout don't worry this auto shotgun because if it's as good as i think it is so he's on purple still we've got a whole team on green which is probably yeah it's a bit more well i mean if you want to go wipe him up we can this guy's just like camping a room or something he's on my level apparently so he's on the roof are you sure he's on your level stuff yeah he's just chilling in there i think he's on the roof you know because it's saying he's not above or below me so he might be on that road there's a room there on purple we can get out the side on these boxes let's see it snipes in the back of their head though crap getting up here and they know you coming with that my swallow d i'm up here i'm just going to keep it on that other team see if i push what you're doing in a push what are you doing in a push where did he go i'm watching the outside of the building i don't see anything banner if he was just afk yeah oh and then he might be on the tippy top roof on blue marker did we go i thought we went up there did you go there yeah we were right at the top well we did go on the top of that bit but we were right i mean it might be up on the tippy top tippy topping poppy he's already he's already found the camp spot two one right he's afk then i think he might be up there maybe i thought that's the only spot let me have a look have a cheeky look oh yeah he's afk up here for goodness sake my first kill is a melee takedown oh god there's a whole team next time you are in severe pain jack do you want to take this truck i think two of us forget okay i think two of us can get in the cab i'm not sure actually this is angle central this thing yeah look two people can get in the cab that's weird i think it's like uh i think a plane is coming oh god we're gonna get straight for jack no it's fine it's fine no i i can't hear anything just letting you know yeah they need to turn down the volume of that as soon as possible and so long yeah it's cool don't get me wrong but like it's way too loud for how far away people are cool where i don't know i know first steps that's great i got it oh my god i got him he's dead there's just one guy on his own your um truck took out all the audio from the ladder so come here right i couldn't resist oh my god i'm perfect oh god i've been slapped oh my god you did it you absolute legend i probably gonna push yeah get high on him which one right there bed marker says are you watching these things on the roof they're on the roof [Applause] they're on the roof next to us [Applause] he should be low he's coming out the window [Applause] didn't get that guy that was on the roof [ __ ] hell this is yeah the audio's a bit crazy i can't hear anything when those players are here also fire stale lasts infinity yeah it just lasts forever nice there was one more guy on the roof over where i was shooting i'm purple uh yeah hang on dude the sound is chalked man like it's the balance is completely off it's all ruined right i'm going for one more i'm landing on the spot still a guy in the building he's still okay no he's in he's he's literally trying to mark him he's there he's there on that red mark dude these planes are pissing me off [Applause] he's further across now okay my mouse just zoomed in again what the hell's happening i guess he's moving again on me yeah i'm in the building that's so frustrating one on the roof down on the roof is there a ladder lucky oh it's actually triggering me so hard this is going downstairs go downstairs go downstairs i've just seen a guy downstairs on that marker okay there's a guy in the tower of this building marking on on green got one that was running over to the building i think there's one below you lucky they rest again yeah they raced again they rest again oh they got fire sale that's why enemy uav can intelligent standby list clear now effects stuff like that broke him here um i don't think so you could just start closing it and see what happens can i click it's not going to break my pc if i close it i think no no no no it just it just counts up uh he was on the bottom floor by the way there was definitely our building yeah yeah guy in that tower careful i'm scared um i'm scared i'm gonna try a cheeky night [Music] [Applause] that's so annoying that the plane sounds nice it's ridiculous so loud it's so loud it doesn't need to be that loud for that long really this guy says they get he's done me i'm gonna go jack i can cover i can cover watch out for the tram start watch out with the charm oh god yeah that kills yeah that says i get you there's a precision air strike on me right now i self-stud please say nice job another one another one there same spot yep same spot same way about whereabouts inside the bottom floor side one more downstairs i think can the game just change oh my god please thank you there was one guy shooting me from the outside of the building on that side coming i don't see anyone else here sod yeah there was one guy outside shooting me from the north they've rested again on the bye that's a bit silly in it what i mean here so we've actually not done too bad there's only 23 players left winning i mean it doesn't feel it doesn't feel like we're winning are you winning son i guess i mean i've got all sorts of technical problems everyone's dying the sound is great it sounds great yep they're pushing over as well from that location i don't see anything throw me off the roof if you jump off if you try and jump up on a ledge it just throws you off the roof that's good you know the the old uh rebirth island a fair cohort of them well i mean we could loop around and go for that bike i saw a guy rotate right like over here so well if we rotate left then we could get to that by because we kind of need it right now yeah let's give it a go okay one of them just shot yeah yeah massive building that is the size of that building that's huge what she said can we remove the sound file i mean that was technically cheating yeah i don't think you'd get away with that i mean ricochet isn't live so hey i'm that's why i'm still playing let's get upstairs let's get upstairs you can get in the tower like i don't know where i think it's in here it's like the fire station this is like the fire station uh do i do i get this cast drop i mean you can do i don't know if it marks you on the mini map when it opens up though no it doesn't they can just see the smoke stop there's so much stuff we actually hold a pretty good position over green ping because there's a full team in uh on green ping right now i'll be honest with you we should probably move earlier though shouldn't we yeah i'm just making sure that they don't move now let's rush out orange okay 100 bring a truck over let's get it i'll restock all supply boxes so they've all been he's been reactivated coming over from green i've turned the winds against this i'll jack you and uh you know the bird's nest you gotta run oh my i'm getting so annoyed with this sorry the mouse yeah it's so annoying hey when i get when i get a tiny bit of stick drift on my controller it pisses me off this literally never happened to me though it's so annoying come on jacqueline i'm coming sorry sorry i don't see it apparently jack must brave the outside world that's fine quickly yeah i'm coming around my skippity hop on the back here i think so skipping up let's go baby nice is there another bite this this building to the right is better than the tram station this one here yeah yeah oh it's cavernous someone just like yeah let's just get in here there's only 19 left yep eighteen is he young big game bounty he's got the most casual kills in the game hasn't he like kills i think he's plunder anderson into the kills yeah he's got the most kills in the game clandy mcplunderson that's a dead end is there no way to get off on the roof oh that's a shame no this is you just have to hold top floor wait wait no you can't you can't get up on the roof okay well this is camp and camp and camp and sit camp and sit through the window the new tent for war zone the camp and sit could you imagine if they did a ttk pass in the balancing update did you imagine that would be heavenly i would be they're all up here on the green mark there's that that's there's team up there is they're on the roof as well yeah i think they're on the roof i think they're on that race i mean we're in a very good spot so i think we're going to get a lot of attention here can you get right to the roof there like on that cocktail you reckon i think yeah i though people can hide in so many different spots oh yeah we need to we need to watch this staircase he's on purple roof now oh oh oh there mark mark mike going out i'm watching that window yeah same slightly missed that one yeah i missed that window guys are a bit out of practice aren't we yeah just a touch yes they're just attached i can see one running into the building below us right in our building yeah in our building oh i don't know i'm at staircase now come to me where's the season i'm just running yeah yeah yeah yeah he's literally on the floor below me right here right here to our left oh he ran right he ran right nice one these are the guys there's another

it's um captain price it's actually a tesla ggs cage i'm just gonna try a different usb port you can kill it i'd be advised bear with me a second guys okay try that see how that goes i thought i didn't even feel like i was in that game i was just getting annoyed all the time update firmware in g-hub can i can i do that i think i can right one second let's have a look restore default settings um dpi lighting [Music] firmware is up to date [Music] i've got the latest version so i don't know pain i guess my motherboard's just dying i suppose [Music] whatever i mean see if it does it again different usb port whatever uh chicken thanks for the five months any idea when the seasonal stuff comes into play harb um i imagine it starts this week i'd guess tomorrow maybe question does jack know ant and deck yeah i know anthony deck who doesn't the fps sean it's really good that cutscene is nice yeah it's uh it's different chao [Music] that game was terrible for me i mean i didn't do anything really so this sniper sucks you can only use vanguard guns in the only playlist they've got at the moment as well are we not searching for a match what's going on just randomly scopes in are you ready to search yes yeah good to go it's very hard i don't know how to build these guns i just don't know the fact that you can put 10 attachments on them as well is nuts absolutely nuts i do have an stg i could use i've maxed out the stj let's see surely you just want to build it for range right lengthened hollow point increase limb damage okay why wouldn't you want that as alpha thank you for becoming a member bazooka eod's really useful now because they've increased the damage of the lethals in the game rahul i'm getting my new pc next week i think i'm getting it on monday i'm kind of regretting not leveling up all my guns in vanguard now although tomorrow i think they're gonna have a playlist where you can just play normal battle rail with like all the weapons from cold war modern warfare vanguard uh cameron thank you use the three line is the three line better i don't know it's all new to me anti-tank rifle three line it's got no attachments on it but whatever [Music] have i tried different walking speeds yet no i haven't james smaller magazines that's the reloads ads speed [Applause] fmj [Applause] less damage at close range what [Applause] it's so much information my brain is just like i don't know how to process this what's up omega thank you man hey cody what's up warzone crashed my ps5 mid game guns weren't missing in my hands sorry i hate him see you later squid first impressions of caldera and weapons jaden i really like the map i mean i've played a little bit on it already in a capture event last week it wasn't on our own accounts it was on accounts that were given to us where everything was unlocked so i really like the map it's cool i think there's some great areas uh just fun to learn something new but in terms of the weapons i'm just overwhelmed it's gonna take a few weeks i think before people you know feel comfortable with what they're using and whatever hey samantha what's up hey reeve ivan thank you for coming guys right i'll try and get win number two how about someone said that yeah yeah somebody put that in my chat i thought that was the issue someone but why in your chat reinstall g-hub is that what people are saying there's a couple of people that have mentioned it in my chat i was just saying jack that i've been having issues where my tkl has been double registering inputs even though the actual physical keyboard is fine so it might just be like robin yeah okay lucky is taking to the skies as well we're all taking a plane yeah i mean there's there's four here i mean i wish i could fly them oh my god the number of people on beach head oh that's not inverted we're all taking place yeah it's not inverted i did invert it in the options though okay we're all taking place then we're all in planes oh here's a man here's a man he's a man that's a kill he's going off the map he's simply going off the map right jack him on your town when you're sick lackey has killed thanos nice too it's nice nice to see that foreign uh um i mean my my plane is completely chores i can't turn at all what yeah i'm just gonna you know and it oh god men i've killed myself oh this is a great start i i hate i hate planes and i want to see them die i managed to down someone but i killed myself and that's not good i'm getting out of the plane yeah i think that's probably good come on guys you need to become seasoned violence i can see the ones that you spot by the way yeah you just seasoned the pilots what you're saying is that you want me to be a uav yes please yeah those controls i need to i need to actually figure out a decent way of controlling that whoa okay got immediately murdered i think i might report him for his name guys could i get reds please good name i mean the planes are very um you know uh yeah and i die jack oh like so far is it very smooth with the mouse you move it around and it's like ah right okay oh dear honestly you can't turn alvin like the controls is absolutely chalked on mouse and keyboard it's really diff okay it's still aiming down the site hold on so different usb port didn't work so if i just close g-hub has been cleared for redeployment quit g-hub and now my mouse has gone to 400 dpi hey i'm gonna have to adjust my in-game sense try that no that's way too high it's just not it's just not working okay right it's four so it's gone to 800 dpi guys i'm sorry about all these technical problems i'm having like it's pain kill streaks make all the noise but your plane makes zero sound like that's good that's what i want oh yeah thanks for resting me guys i know i'm crap sorry for bringing the team down nice i've just closed g-hub to see if that makes a difference my guy was saying reinstall g-hub plug if you're playing wireless pull the receiver out and put it back in again yeah just do like a full resetting spaghetti and it should work i can use my super light again then because i thought it was just broken broken machine washing machines broken i wish the zip lines were like 20 42 zip lines i'll be honest but where are they just yeah they're just insta they're so horrible you'd think for a fast-paced game like this they would be but it's not no there's a bar station here oh god oh god i got flat cannons okay and what is the recall on this gun oh my goodness i mean is that the mg42 yeah the flat cannon is instant [Music] oh yeah tommy got the kill with it in the capture session didn't he uh enemy plane he may be strafing me he's thinking about it you beam it you can you can shoot the plane with normal ammo oh yeah i i have no ammo unfortunately so what i do have is this thankfully he's not very smart playing i'm not a big fan of the ground luke so far i have to be honest well it's all vanguard isn't it so the builds are just they just feel horrible it's because we're not used to the vanguard weaponry vanguard way way way i mean that baoz all right yeah i got a nice bar i got i got um an stg from the goo leg oh yeah of course because you come with that with it didn't you right okay well at least we got something where's the plane oh good lord right uh we should probably go to this and capture it yeah let's get it i mean you i might go for a world record playing game not maybe not this round maybe maybe in a couple of days yeah there's a flat cannon here somebody died here is this where you killed someone lucky or someone rest at the bye in front of me probably oh loadout guys behind us yeah but we're we're capping we're gonna go and get the supply drop this over here and weapons i know we'll come back for them what the weapon sorry you're a weapon harry learn how to use it harry no not like that harry harry didn't point it to me stop touching me with your weapon unexpectedly well lucky it sounds like um you're having fun and they're not i don't think they are stud and i'm okay with that i'll be honest with you i'll be honest i don't think when i get killed by a first plane i don't think i'm gonna enjoy it by the way my horn is definitely not the road mongrel horn that it says it that's definitely not road one girl did you get your guns stud yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah there's about four people on that red marker orange marker they've had enough oh they're sick of it are they sick of it yeah definitely we should probably head in that direction yes i might tell them can you climb up rocks now kind of they're being a little mountain guard they're stud oh yeah i'm just testing it testing it testing he's in the tower he's in the tower there's a lot of them yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go get my loadout drop and then i'm gonna there's a guy in that in here jack in here i mean my options cam sorry hey guys we got him oh my god twice this fall got him down i'll call him come on there's a guy behind us down to the southeast yeah this is painful yeah pull it out hold on ping him off and i'll go ruin him give me a second i don't know where he is hey guys you can find out now yeah that's that's the guy that's down okay i'll do this afterwards sorry i'm messing around ping him off boys pick him off he's oh he's left side he's just to the back of the building he's low he should be low oh god lucky nice one oh my god got back the b flats there's a whole team on the hill on orange yeah a 150. yeah yeah orange orange ping orange pink mm-hmm orange let's see if i can scroll in but on green on green i'm green they're pushing in the the uav is just finished we're getting the roof on us it broke on the hill one down button nice one lucky keep strafing keep straight yeah i'm doing my hand what can up on the right lads there's one further right on the hill yeah different team the more live pings you get on them the easier it is for me straight in the building in front of me downed in him oh my god i absolutely ruined him is it a different team signed or sent in maybe i can't tell there were four pings we've got i think two of them okay i'll uav again there you go there you go i'm ping something on things it's only that guy ever [Applause] there's one of the hills shooting at me sniping up the hill whereabouts i could see 20 320 oh up there have there okay oh yeah i see yeah unfortunately dude these scopes are awful man what the vision the visual recoils they've got to work on it's going to really put people off using um like vanguard guns in the main battle rail modes yeah oh he's landing near you lucky oh wow you're going to spare players coming yeah i've got one giant that's what's going on i'm moving over to the fire sale though so it's fine got a couple of jacks visibility's not the best on this map by the way i'm struggling [Music] so oh god there's a guy right on the buy station jack um sorry stop i'm going with you he's not there anymore unless he's moved i hear him underneath maybe even directly underneath there are only two teams all the way over here so just that's going to be trouble eventually yeah up the stairs maybe i think that's a different guy yeah the guy yeah don't forget get your free self rest for the uh buy station oh yeah yeah yeah quickly you don't it doesn't even need to be quick fire lasts forever now by the way it lasts forever where guy over here on green on green time to you what happened no no no there's just a guy on the green yeah it's a guy on green coming towards us there's a guy down the hill yeah yeah see him down oh i see i see you going for that guy this is called an air strike on me i think that's the ghosted guy he just waited there the whole time cool and wesley wesley okay i'm not having a good time today guys [Applause] there's a guy dropping on the building now lackey do you see him yeah i've just seen didn't get more ghosted people on green by the way more ghost [Applause] um he just spawned in what oh my okay lovely a bit of control or auto in there you're still on purple right there's also going green as well nice one lucky oh the fire sale just ended no i mean i'm not really you can you can still get me stud i think the guy who killed me at the back of the building on uh over here he killed me on green on green all right lucky get out of that plane come on i think i'm being more effective in the plane he's still there in that building yeah i'm purple yeah if you guys get back to runway and use i think you'll be in a good spot i think runway i mean maybe that barracks building yeah it's probably better for you uav pass nothing yeah but he's ghosted he's ghosted lucky so i'll say he didn't show up on that as well he won't show up ghost is to be pretty strong very very strong again do you want to go for that supply oh i was going to get back to the shop and rest you can go you can go for the supply i think i think there you go and you can swim now can't you so you don't die in the water yeah well you can't really swim well yeah if you if you i think you get cold-blooded if it comes up to your like your waist or something and you get tracker if you're just walking in it so this will give you cold blooded i think jack just people won't see you out here is this loadout create a different color yeah it's orange i just landed on me [Applause] that's weird that gave you thermites jack that doesn't you can't choose thermites as part of your loadout that's weird and now you've got a stim as well if you apply the stim it makes you sprint faster for three seconds after you've used it what am i well i might have people on me i don't know someone's just someone revived near me i can't jump up this rock oh my god flying past you start yeah they go in the jungle to that jungle i don't see him thank you he is to your like here do we get a free loadout at the end of this circle i think we do don't we is there much gear around here or are we pretty is it freezing he's in the plane he's in the plane [Applause] so i'm less than helpful right now okay so we're running over to those guys that lucky ducky down to yeah remember two of us can fit in a plane as well so if we need to escape the team he just got the team what is this whereabouts i killed them uh near the buy station okay okay i think i see one they just respawn all the time the plane just respawned this is the guy that killed me earlier this is the guy that killed me i'm surprised he didn't pick up my gear what is this play playing gameplay they don't know how to deal with it though they're not battlefield players they're just like oh play that'll never kill me oh wait restart oh that's funny as soon as i just got a car 98 prestige okay nice you've got 11 kills you're literally flying there i don't really know what i've done but you know i don't know what i've done to deserve this but you literally went from four kills to eleven in about under two minutes so i couldn't fly it when i tried i would literally say two more two more for lacking two more downs just just how about you but when i die to a plane i'm not gonna complain at all there's a guy right yeah nearly adam bro he's not dead yeah [Applause] all right let's push up i mean i'm gonna go for a pilot world record i got a uh recall on this one what the hell let's push up to this buy station yeah there's fighting behind fighting behind yeah yeah i've got two smg's so good luck just dropped in that was weird yeah they tried getting a plane to kill me there's a plane coming in near us guys running in through two rides do you guys running over kill them all okay [Music] down one that one nice nice stop this one he's running up literally literally can't see him stop can't see him at all that's fine you keep an eye out though i keep getting stuck on nothing are you beaming him lucky there was literally a vehicle that was on his building yeah he's basically no purple oh he's on me now close right i don't see him right i mean somewhere this is like a flying bolty in battlefield 2042 it's lovely spiders that's a sniper that might not be him i don't know i might just break one ping it ping it purple red mark purple red mark orange marker as well yeah [Applause] yeah he's close he's in that window in this building here lucky on the purple on the orange mark one down oh god

bro dead dead got him thank you right um it's us 4v 3v1 i think something like that okay one's over there one ping oh my god it's come to us but we need to get that rock right here place rock now pushing in the open as long as we haven't got a um precision otherwise we're ruined but there's literally no other cover apart from that rocker two rocks two rocks this is kind of a cool finish not gonna lie well i mean we got the zone as well so just be careful you're running towards the mickey i'm grinding he's going for the full finish i'm going for the plates against plates on green on green is it one for the right one finish one more on green more in green it's us versus you guys two guys left two guys left yep on green team target location one moving left one moving left i can't see him from my angle china's stun no sun he'll be up there he'll be moving left flipping around there's the broke once broke down down nice nice nice the last guy is on the left and he's here he's on purpose he's broken he's right yeah he's down behind that that's the guy i downed he's [Applause] where is he up here i just down here behind the rock he's behind the rock nice well played well played ggs gg lads is is the gas like uh glitching out for you as well when you look at it it's definitely for me it's just more yellow than it used to be ggs i'm feeling some i'm feeling some talking [Music] gg is feeling a little chalky yeah i'm feeling a bit chalky i don't know i'll be honest i've got a lot of um doing inputs on my keyboard i can't do as many inputs as i used to on vedansk like if i want to crouch slide and then move like i can't like do all of that and then switch weapons at the same time it's a bit funny it's not quite the same but ggs yeah it was good it's lovely i mean i really enjoyed that game guys yeah you spent 90 [Music] if you fly into the sky box and hit the air brakes you uh go into a nosedive that lasts about 30 seconds bloody hell [Laughter] and if you guys lie thing people on the ground i can basically wipe an entire squad nice so um i might be in a plane this game i mean i'm not i'm not sure but you think you're gonna be a playing main is what you're saying i'm thinking i might try and set a record for it and then call it a world record playing kills i think i can set a record on playing kills 100 with this controller and the battlefield skills in my in my veins i think it's possible i would like to just use my um my cold war weapons you know well hopefully tomorrow jack i really regret not leveling everything up yeah vanguard was [ __ ] sorry that's how much you can do right i'd like to find a place where i can actually control the plane on mouse cable because it just wasn't turning for me at all what you do jack you you do the entire round in a controller i'll be fine i can't play on controller check weapons you'd be okay are you using the sniper stud thank you yes i'm gonna try car 98 now because the type 99 and the three line are just chalked is that literally okay move around we'll be fine it's fine oh god it's fine [Applause] all right let's land somewhere with a plane um get me back in the direction [Applause] i mean since i closed g-hub it hasn't done it so i think that's what's going on yeah [Applause] i thought it would be all my other settings look fine i was having huge i've been having issues with g-hub by my tkl i turned off g-hub and left like a an input mapper like an input like key logger so to speak and it was very obviously just randomly pressing inputs for no reason when it was when g-hub was on when it was off it wasn't oh second win in the bag again i didn't really feel like i did anything in that game i'm just uh fighting against the game but it's fine uh mathis thank you for the five [Music] [Applause] i am playing on pc crispy's yeah what's up sean this makes me think of the jungle map from pubg it's got similar vibes yeah for sure i'll meet you guys there yeah like he's grabbing a plane and he'll meet us there see you with the plane there's rumba rapids over here just below the ruins oh cool can we get a boat got it okay i thought yeah 300 people on your 300 i bought i think we should have bought yeah get away from that let's render abort [Applause] all right i've got a gun so watch out i've got a gun what's up studies about study's about with his gout [Laughter] he's not the the shoe fits if the shoe fits eat it if the pessimism fits if stone's not complaining there's something wrong i've just not been complaining on the mic uh there's a guy with another one around right in front of me that helps my entertainment value start i appreciate that thank you for the cover there john appreciate that no jack i've just picked up the mg what is this st just just look look just use this and just aim and shoot it it's going to happen at the buy station it's unusable do you want it back no you have it it's out what is that georgetown i mean it's absolutely choked yeah this guy eat it out i don't know where he ran to i think he's over here oh i'm getting frustrated with my mouse man is it still clicking it just feels horrible i think i've ruined something it might be time for another format oh jack don't worry i'll just see one yeah i just did one um i'll get new pc next week anyway so whatever huge what are you going for jack nintendo 64 emulator pc yeah i went for the commodore 64. now it's pretty much just top spec 1200k nice 39e 80 giga ddr5 that's going to get some pretty disgusting frames apparently the 12 900 is because of the new architecture apparently is actually quite a lot better in some games good luck with the electricity bill oh don't worry about that it's already massive well the company pays for that so oh my god i just heard that don't do it there's no way you're killing anyone in a range of that oh no maybe that might iron sight bren yeah yeah i switched out [Applause] nice little rapid fire smg there if anyone wants to be there's all these guys in lagoon they've got no cover i've got no fans i'm going on our ground right i'm pushing up on this compound where you were shooting people stud uh yeah there's like everything right here yeah there's a lot of people in there i'm just saying the trees are too thin and there's no cover that's what i say the trees need to be thicker yeah yeah there's the same pg problem we need thick boy trees the exact same problem no one told them about the trees they didn't get any feedback from the game changers obviously white games crap notice how every game that comes out the game changes don't touch it's rubbish even if it's not made by yeah yeah exactly there's a guy in that corner i can't in the window in the window i'm being beamed here this is sorry can i get some cover gun shot everywhere but the center of my screen i think they're going to try and peel away to the left-hand side they're in here they're in here this is quite painful just bombard the building if you can you just downed one then you get the fact that you get 3d spotting is just mental and the fact that the bullets magnetized to the person i'm shooting at to make it easy for the babs that's why okay i'm inside the building where are they this is baba's royale i mean no there's one more there's definitely one more there was two marks crazy mr magoo so we're going for the lagoon now yeah laguna a bud right i mean you know yeah all right here we go come on a fat nug it's fine i've got a good clip specialist you got specialist jack yeah and you get you get tempered with specialists insane starting a regular blue crate yeah i'm going to go back and get lucky don't you worry i don't know like it's got ghoulie is he going to win this game i don't know i mean no i don't think like he's ever lost a goulash have you ever seen him in the game i've just thrown knifed him he's dead we were going for lagoon but like you know yeah lagoon is hot there are many men there well i'm having i'm having a luke and i don't see men well it's like this side of lagoon oh okay so we got a little ways to go all right i might get uav yeah i can only back the beef so far i'm afraid if i don't have my ac 130 i mean it's not an ac-130 it's basically what it is jack i mean yeah there's no no need to battery there there they are over here mark them look at them one super close behind this building off you go jackie i need you a lot to back it i've got an anti-air vehicle bring it to me oh well i will i'm on the way on the way got him down jack maybe i shouldn't have used the bbsh there i've got a um i've got the anti-air vehicle here ready for if you bring him back is he's chasing yourself i think he's even i think he's left you alone lucky we need we've got 500 meters to go until we get our loadout so we need to keep moving that way we've got some people up here on green wanna get in my truckee oh it's threat to injury okay guys still loads of guys in the group on them we need to go for our loading yeah let's go for our lady first oh the anterior can i get in yeah i get the seat wait let's go get the load out get the loadie over here it's so loud what jack i said it's so loud oh my god this is kind of mental is there any enemy planes around that i can shoot uh yeah uh i'm trying every single small bump knocked my baby what say again i'm dead all right we're going for the loadout i've been ambushed they play an ambush look for the planes look at the planes go go go plane bush plane bush oh gosh this is just like world war ii guys i mean the flying in this game feels like oh it's like we had three loadouts here yeah i remember this in my history books got melody and that's when the allies got their loadie and oh he beamed me beam yard was it he was on the minimap are you sorry yeah he's down here okay that's when the allies got there lodi he's all right broke him breaking jack oh there's a guy here on me god damn it i'm getting quite a lot of stuttering in the sound by the uh positions good once they got to berlin oh my goodness knew that they were choked ah dear i can't hear a thing guys i literally can't hear anything yeah we got we all got google lag yeah we all we've all gulags apart from lackey who when we went for the second precision air strikes on the ground and the allies use them on the beaches please please turn the volume down in the girl streets please i'm begging you [Laughter] every time [Applause] hey you can hear footsteps in the gulag jeez the shotgun they're no longer with us [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] good job study i remember the google ad from world war ii yes well actually most of the allies didn't make it past the gulag once they died on the beaches they didn't get a second chance guys guess what we're gonna have to wear face masks a bit more and work from home oh wait are we yeah according to boris he's telling us we have to work from home now so why they're doing a new press conference yeah plan b restrictions will be reintroduced to me no lockdown have they done tears or lockdowns and then no it says guidance to work from home face masks will have to be worn in more public venues including cinemas and theaters and covered passes proving that vaccination or a negative test will be required at night clubs and venues with large crowds welcome to portugal [Applause] save me save me okay it just right clicks again i saw that jack this is insane have you done a reinstall of g-hub no i just turned it off i'll do it i mean i did it again oh if that doesn't fix it i mean wiping windows these days isn't too

um the stability in this uh in this client is not brilliant like just in like there's like little glitches and stuff all over the place like getting stuck on things yeah i get stuck on invisible things as well like you're running over a little gap it'll go up and then you're oh i died yeah interesting i haven't had any of that so far yeah because you're well i played two games on the ground i didn't get anything stop i can't help you he's not finished the video for tomorrow there's you know what i would pay money i would actually sponsor tommy and bong to play this game and let me watch them 500 quid to play i'd pay them 10 grand each a day to make them play this a month one whole month [Applause] i just want to see i want my sponsors tell me about my entertainment i just want to see like you know the sort of like sleep experiments where people go crazy after like the third day right i want that what is your plan now jack oh my god the tag says no thank you in the chat a million dollars to play this come on 500 to play it for five hours hundred quid an hour well so me and you are going to sponsor tag them together [Applause] i honestly think they'd rather do a 24-hour stream of literally anything else i'm gonna go autumn at on this round and i do have a three-line sniper i've got a three line absolutely yeah i know it's probably going to make me die or something but you weren't kidding about the uh fa stabilizer if you put it on like every gun it's just insane yeah i mean you obviously you're on the minimap because you're not using a suppressor uh go give subsonic rounds last two yeah but then you want the lengthened round so you've got a better bullet velocity like if you're going to build it that way oh it's a very sticky one yeah yeah oh chat thank you for sticking with me um it's been a bit difficult but we're sticking in there you know uh thanks thank you for becoming a member appreciate that buddy i hope you guys are enjoying this i know it's a bit it's a bit chalk so far but you know we'll make the most of it we've got two wins i feel like i'm playing like i've never played the game before but it is what it is you know we'll keep going it's a bit out of way yeah yeah i mean here's the cash drop there you go yeah let's do that i like that i'm green yeah yeah yeah the green cash drop not even the volcano yeah you know the color green don't you jack yeah i do yeah personally or he's a good lad that gives you a good one good luck there is a guy coming with us just one lad he's coming he's coming he's coming he's chasing jack he wants jax he knows it's jack he wants jack's money i don't like him there he is hey he's landing behind you i'm 3d spotting him he's landing on you what's he doing get him get him jack yeah i i i fear he might be there come on jack get him you're here to be safe gentlemen come on jack get a bloody melee tape done oh can't i yeah oh this actually might be broken everyone says oh we found a semi-automatic car 98 the other day didn't we lucky i found it yeah i mean it shouldn't have been a thing oh wrong one please literally sorry i can't remember which one it is uh i have 12 grand that's 12 grand let's buy a load oh wait we can't no wait we must use the ground loads i'm using the new gun that's already available in van gaal the cooper custom the cooper custom nine thousand will do all right you just fly over for us stacking shirts really i already did you're good to be fine yeah yeah according to my um skill no it's got to be skill west it can't be anything else surely i read you know what's going on what the car knight is way better than the other snipers it's the scopes it feels like yeah we got one jack well i had one in my loadout last month no look at that it's like so much faster it doesn't matter man it's still choking yeah yeah everything's true but apparently this is like a 1900 meter per second 1400 meters later 1900 meters a second that's not that's what someone said and i was like there's no way to start that's ridiculous i reckon it's like 190 meters a second instead yeah it can't be 1900 meters a second that's basically hit scanned in this game yeah i did what i could last day it's fine lucky i got him i got him what's your bloody hopes though anymore uh not as far as i can tell i've gone back down to one threat lucky you're the only person who actually uses planes as well yeah no one knows no one else has gotten a plane well you see i'm a scum jack there's no other way around it i mean what was that point threat threat to me just got right wait what was that what you got no i'm dead [Applause] [Music] yeah i can't hit it i can't hit the broad side of a barn with it outside about 30 minutes it's still aiming in oh and it's windows 11. all right i've got a guy below me are these guys still pushing yeah they're still pushing down by the red markers you guys until you can barely walk him in there right like a belly walk i believe um where's my chili bear i can walk i don't remember where my lawyer is okay i'm still being hit i don't see many they're down in the down in the grass yeah we're down here somewhere down here on green that's a problem for me i mean look you know there's one run away yeah they are running away i mean let's let's get this let's get this slide out can't watch there's no station over there i want to get my car nia if i can [Music] they're running away that dp vehicle coming towards us uh munitions box on me um wait can i get to my loot he jumped out they dropped out they dropped out they're getting something they're grabbing something on the marker [Applause] strike on him oh there you go destroyed the vehicle uh there's a as44 there oh i got slaves what the hell behind the hill behind east east i'm trying to get i'm trying to get behind the yeah we've got 25 grand eastern i know yeah i know we're in between two squads oh my god there's three teams three teams there's not three teams this truck here this truck here the next to stodd is probably in good isn't good lucky [Applause] dude no footsteps is there any more uh and he still managed to get six punches in the head like the the melee wasn't making noise either for me that's right i was just like no you're dead right i mean what the hell i mean to be fair we weren't in the greatest position in the game all right he's on the edge of the zone he's gonna get pushed by his own jack this is just what that's the sniper though isn't it how can you see me there's another one there's one closer get in the truck and i [Applause] no i can't hit him jack look watch watch mike watch my kills are you watching oh no i'm in gulag i can't hit anything victory wrestling i mean we were in a fairly okay position on the hill and then two guys out of nowhere come along and melee us with no footstep audio [Applause] loadout is in the zone but obviously it's right next to where we were can i get it i mean you could try [Applause] i mean if there are men there you will die there's a second lady fights are very open if i can put it below yeah but the whole point is is like this is the cover here what the hell is this there is nothing so this is this is kaleidoscope from 2042 stud everything around peak is known what's that at the top of the hill is it a uh a control point and i think i think that's gonna die unfortunately oh my gosh it gets crashed again what is happening yeah i just got pulled out into the lobby what i mean it was for the best it probably was for the best that one at least anyway uh right first impressions everyone i can see why they launched the new kernel driver in specifically one region i'm going to try abs instead of toggle and just see if that changes starting to understand why they did that now well that that was um that was a bit mental wasn't it that was dreadful oh i've unlocked the car 98 lovely hey he's unlocked the gun i need a gun baby the gun i picked up literally just fired in a cone it was cut it was combo they've all still got spread start yeah but no but some of them don't though yeah but no rifles don't but the smg i picked up was just pure cone that's pure cocaine i mean the fact that we've got people on our block list already means that spm is fully working as intended guys about the fact that if they've put the anti-cheat in asia where do you think the cheat is gonna go europe europe well no it makes no sense they shouldn't have said anything because yeah they shouldn't have said a word effectively what's happened now is they've told everybody the anti-cheats only live in asia so everybody's just gonna download the european or american version of the game and then vpn permanently well the thing is then but then when the the new meme kicks in properly it will then catch them wherever they are but yes i do agree with you well the problem is though westy is that if the if the cheaters aren't playing in asia because they know that the anti-cheat's active then the actual anti-cheat itself can't train itself to detect anomalies i'm sure it's gonna do okay famous last words [Laughter] at least it's something right like at least it is actually a colonel antichi it's better than what was there before which was you know literally a private one now it's a kernel easy anti-cheat can actually be very good if it's in the right hands okay all the ideas for that last part what do you think guys i love hold ladies check that's my favorite what do you think so am i is a mouse still short or no i mean the whole ads if it's procking the toggle even if i have hold on it should zoom in for a second though right like yeah like fraction yeah so i'll be able to tell [Applause] i can see what you mean about the velocity on this thing bloody hell oh yeah that's it scam 100 car yeah let's get into this curve this the site on the car 98 though like i don't i don't get it what the default update yeah the white one the one i'm alright with that really right okay yes all right jack it's fine basically jack what you need what you want what you want is all of the modern warfare and cold war optics for world war ii guns that's what you want white on yellow is fine gosh how did you not know that tommy just said i didn't know jack was a toddler [Laughter] even just just you just if you just open it but if [Applause] i'll be on the floor this round okay okay maybe maybe i'll get the cash drop behind it that's what i said when i was four you know i'm [Music] christian thank you for becoming a member [Music] we're sticking in here guys we're sticking in it i've changed it to old ads now so i guess i won't be as bad who knows man who knows [Applause] i think i've killed like six people and told you in this stream and we've been live for an hour and 53 minutes no they're just going to basically use slider thicken i didn't mean to say that you know age of empires right where they can just select all the units right just like the engine select all the trees large and uses won't cause any problems using five gig more of your frame buffer brilliant right i got the 12k boys i got the 12k i mean there's a lot more cash in this that's for sure why is the mp40 gun model so huge huge huge huge huge dude i think it was actually jack or maybe maybe it wasn't jack in the video in previous life i just dubbed it i was like behind the camera yeah just off camera a giant egg a a giant a bro you're a hacker that one's throwing [Applause] people just shooting explosive battles no when you cheat on an example a little bit more tax evasion a little bit naughty though naughty that breaking the speed limit a little bit naughty that attacking on war zone a little bit naughty though right okay i've got a double barrel and i don't know what to do with it [Music] [Applause] already in meme mode it's day one please and we we've got to be i mean jack's struggling he's on the struggle bus today isn't he we've got to get one more win for the trifecta by design the trifecta is is this intentional what a triumph of design did you just say you come here and you find out all right i'm coming over have a look at what we're looking at what is it oh uh oh barrel oh dear let's have a look what is it attached to is it just welding onto the end i mean yeah it literally welded it up you've welded that onto the end there that's unusual someone's a straight us in the plane and without about the sight is this what you do with it i can't in fact i can't wait to die and we can't do anything with it uh christian thanks again it cheers man appreciate the four very kindly no fov slider on console um hopefully they add it soon because i know they talked about it in the past i think it's panned out that way you let your teammate die you let your teammates die apparently i didn't let anyone die what that's what you said yeah i just came through my headset let your teammates die and i'm like um i think they're still alive right uh we can immediately buy another loadout the moment it ticks over two minutes so spam sure yeah i think i think we can i mean i've got 18 million bajillion pounds i've got daddy oh my god [Music] i got a selfrest out of a crate um lucky that is the slowest firing projectile i've ever seen in my life come here come here come here come here come look at this all right maybe i can outrun i'm gonna shoot at that house all right i'll outrun it right yeah i am the movie [Laughter] here we go overhead oh there's man up there by the way guys i think you can go behind waterfalls in this game no no no no no no no we've chosen an interesting angle to fight it no stun on top yeah being beam from the back side down leaving in the bum hole one above me up here guys saving another one got one hair down i got sniped from from the left down below you can do it lucky yeah i don't know about that angle we thought i'm not so sure stop i think it was great i think it was fine i do want to specify that that m1 felt quite disgusting it's okay stop don't worry it makes for a good video there's a good story arc going on there's a good start i like the um narrative we were rubbish but we still won jack have a look at this uh stud he is to your left i believe it's the same one that i've got like he's got no recall on it yeah it doesn't move at all and now there's no one to give me a call and i've got a man am i going for a loadout or is it there um it's only our loadout i don't know let's go i think it's just he just i think the magnum cues up shots and i hate it when it does that yeah it queues up shots brilliant it's fine don't worry basically jack that'd be great for you if it's on multiple clicks in the game i'm gonna i'm just gonna say jack you are flushed with the notes i've got 28k yep is there a bye nope there's one behind you guys i think back down the hill get the car on the air well i want the car uh [Music] yeah this gun literally doesn't move yeah well i mean it's very dmrs isn't it it's an m what is it an m1 or it's a m1 it's an m1 with an extended mac extendy mag bendy extended it looks like it could be disgusting it's a g43 oh it's a g43 like a g43 i'm gonna sing this one right let's get down there go north into fields maybe thank you very much my mental health after three weeks difficult to climb up i'm not happy about that i thought the whole i thought the whole point was that you were you were gonna be able to climb everything yeah literally literally literally unplayable these steps are easy to climb but they're not everywhere [Applause] you're having fun there lucky don't worry can there's a there's still only one route that you can save a mountain you're just like oh there it is circle mountain mountain [Music] can we find pride rock again jack do you think we can find it maybe i don't know where it is what's so good about bride rock well we could do the lion king bit that's the best part of the game oh that's the best part it's actually i don't even know if i can get on this i can't get on it i'm simply on the back [Music] i find a semi no one else uses planes like we said like i haven't seen anyone else in a plane no when they realize it's the meta they will yeah they will they'll they'll realize that and then we're all ruined give them to my video tomorrow we in fields at the moment are yeah we're near fields would then want to get out and get a screen shot because this mountain looks rather nice nah i'm good all on my low graphics sayings yeah yeah my ultra low graphics big i wish places could say i wish you could save your own graphics presets and then quickly switch between them rather than having to change all of the things that would be good after we buy another uav and some stuff i was going to take us to the house yeah no no the the shop the shoppie yeah i mean where is everyone i mean where is everyone right now no one's going to these like more obscure places at the moment uh someone's already been here oh no i buy armor i can drive you money you get self-resistant so well yeah i've already got i've got already got a selfie you can even get a second lowdown i can drop cash if anybody needs yes please no i'm self-reside it's alfres uh i mean we're in the right place that's for sure yeah it was yeah someone got their load out here look there's loads of gear fire sale could have just got all of them you're kidding you're actually kidding me right uav uav it's actually a thing it's actually a thing like they queue it up properly so now each circle has one of these things on it oh here we go here we go it will impress the airstrike just to ruin everyone's eardrums seen him is there oh yeah one of those in the building got that one at the back he's inside one further back you running what's he doing he's just up high he's just chilling in here is he dead what happened to him he quit i think he might i think i think he just quit does he leave his gear no he didn't quit he's right here look oh it's because ghosts ghost has changed doesn't it how's it working uh if you're because he's still still if you stand still yeah it goes oh so you're spotted when you so what you're saying is it's actually better just camped with ghost well that it shouldn't work that way it should be the other way around surely oh player coming in where direction there on the red mark oh well um we're being straight that one yeah it wasn't us it wasn't us it's a whole team about me all team unlucky are they gonna get you probably okay where did but our thingamajig came from somewhere else wait wait wait don't don't don't don't push down there don't push down there it's kind of a bit open to be pushing that one on the right position let's just respawn in the window oh yeah yeah yeah where are those bullets going it's because of the fire sale they've rest yeah i'm not actually sure where my sniper bullets are going i mean should we pull back or yeah i think we should pull away there's one in the closest building now as well my god yeah this the sniping with these snipers is terry blue pain yeah i mean i have no idea where those shots are going the fact that the sniper sounds literally like does it he's brushing in the building yeah he's in the building oh my god [Applause] i'm running out of ammo one left one left one left yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah below that'll be like i'm gonna be uh [Applause] i can hear him he's running around nice job right we got the other team now there's another team pushing probably lose and your fight is over oh man prove you can still fight soldier why why is everyone fighting the gulag afk what the hell's going on with the second guy uh what what do you need stud i'm fine if i seem like i run out of bullets in the magazine can i drop on you uh yes you can yeah you can drop on us yeah this building here jack you might want to maybe loot it i think it's already been looted actually where did i die um very good question i was in that little shop on me on me i'm there bounce down there's another one you can't i didn't see a single person when i die there i don't know where the other person is there's one more on the top there yeah on that right side one self rising on the right side nice double stun on me self rest self self rest yeah yeah where are they they're up on that hill where lucky is you just killed one i mean but the visibility there was uh i could see them because i was over 30 meters right you got sniped behind me always air strikes me the scum there's a guy just hiding in a bush near there [Music] he was on the right side of the house saying him saying right now he's right there there's the mark can't get him he's gone down the race he's down he's [Applause] jesus what is going on here bushes bushels by the way ultimate on do you guys need to round that out that's what's been getting that's what's been getting me the kills that's what's been doing it when i'm using my 811 right okay you need stodd needs to rest so back down oh we can't go to that by because it's going to be out of zone soon so we're going to have to go for this one uh there's gear here if you need to have time if you went down there it might be i don't know if it's safe though armor satchel this is where i died yeah yeah i don't know where you live problem is the one the other one that's closer in is definitely got people on it so yeah they're fighting on that one oh that was me just shooting there okay just testing the mp4 [Applause] is it good mp5 like ah the supply drop oh trigger to eliminate the belly target that's the big game bouncy so that's the guy who's got the most kills or the most money in the game most kills okay i can't get that by because i'm going to die so my guns are too heavy that's what she said so yeah well then we've got a gas mask uh i do have a gas mask yes it's just yellow in the trunk i don't have enough to bite to res and then we've got an asteroid you're gonna have to go full left side i think unless there's cover on your right thank you cam all right i think westy yeah all right lucky's gonna put like they're still in the building no yeah there's there's two it there were two in that building remember you're going to get pushed by the zone first you've got a bit of time though i'm doing the wide right the wide right is definitely an option it's lucky be careful lucky if that second guy pushes you i'm flanking around behind the building now enemy uav active there's a uav up with defo on that enemy up here camera in front are they shooting each other yeah there's another guy in that building right there the second guy that was in that building that we were just at he got killed there's another guy in that building on green there's a further guy out there up the road be careful what he's going lucky keep going yeah i was annoying he shot you through the bush he probably spotted you keep your senses i should be safe here jack down there got a bit of time you got about 30 seconds before the zone even gets to you might rotate right actually right it's good we went that way before you got there's a guy there he's gone to the building there's two on me no there's a guy behind me as well shooting me from the big tall building oh my god yeah two different teams my mom's completely disconnected then oh that's a shame no i got immediately he really did wait peter because he wanted the kill he wanted the kill we should just go continually right i think are we gonna get stuck here though lucky i don't know no no no i think from the map we should be okay no he didn't actually start he didn't wait he just uh used his uh control room to basically just jump around the corner and instantly lock on to me so they still haven't fixed the rock climbing which i thought they'd actually like gone yeah yeah just climb up any rock you want get free wi-fi anywhere you go oh two no no you guys might want to hit that but you're stuck on the rocks again i'm in a tree and i can't move oh i tried to climb up a rock hold on no you want to cook a grenade wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait guess it's closing in i'm actually stuck here no jackie well here's one for the the bug team there you go you get stuck here just pop the molotov's down jack got the molotov down oh that's it like this yeah let me get in what are the odds yes hey pro play from lucky now a little bit naughty that right come on boys right if we can win this another another chalked game bring it back from the chalk guys come on you've got enough perez's you got it you got the res i mean is there a buy station there's one all the way over the other side of the circle horrible yeah you're ruined don't bother going for that no no no you've got to push for it come on no no no no no no they have a chance don't this i think we have the facilities right nah well i'm getting i'm guessing you don't oh threat right too all right it's time to hide come on jackson like he's in bed he's had enough you got my teddy bear lucky i'm scared i don't right i'll watch the door you watch the window you might want to put that knife away lucky it's a one shot now though they've gone away they've gone away look at the threat yeah yeah they've decided they've decided you're not worth it it's bad it's pay it's great i think it's those markers over there attempting to guy up the hill there is definitely out the back of this building to the uh to the south east you go to the south east out of the building where lucky's going you're safe i think yeah i think you're good okay i'm gonna i'm gonna try back it from uh obscure position jack spotted someone jack spotted someone really close to him we have to go that way dude can i get this in there they just i just saw you just oh great can i actually get up to you lackey there's a zip code look down on jack look down on deck help oh there's more than one where's the zip where's this zip ah just keep going you've got a gas mask zip there right in front of your building basically i mean we're playing against the cracked players of all cracked players i would stun that as well how did i get stung there did you see where that stun grenade went yeah and i was outside the building oh no roughage i believe roughage did you just see what happened i i just was in the building and then and i was outside the building he threw it through with like two doors and it went all the way around the back of the building oh god that was good i don't think you had i don't think you had line of sight in your jack at all no it didn't it just stunned me through the building one more now yeah one more one more one more if you say shilom and kim 10 am tomorrow what do you mean you want to get up oh you want it you want to get on early i'm definitely going on oh yeah i'm down to i'm down to play this because like there's so much of the map to explore there's so much we haven't even looked at yet i'm down to get [Laughter] i'm gonna redownload the game on my main pc overnight and see if i can make it work again maybe put it on a drone drive yeah jack just go outside you know if you've got one of those little um those little fire pits in your back garden get one yeah get one of them just put the mouse in it small ceremony and then cover it in lighter fluid rest in peace and pepperoni maybe maybe maybe get a hammer and smash the mouse up first and then put it in the fire okay and then you know and then set it on fire yeah that'd be good maybe do a little like a little dance around it as well like just you know a little little devil chant or something what someone the devil i mean i mean clearly there's the devil inside the mouth we need to extract the devil okay i'm getting pretty sober in the garden yeah burn the mouse after i've smashed it with a hammer summon the devil devil comes out priest gets it away reckon you could get a priest on fire and you could just hold your phone up and he could do the ceremony and you get pretty sound five i bet you can you probably can you could do a confession over fiverr can we go to the volcano just because we haven't been there yet yeah sure tommy said he wants to put the pillow over warzone it's time to stop it's time to start i gotta say the the map layout is very open but they look so very urban it's it's like you get these big these big like vistas which have 300 windows to peek from do you know you know what it reminds me of it's it's it's the um fortnite chapter one map loads of pois and in between nothing no it's literally sanhok they've got the exact same issues sanhok has [Applause] so start saying thicker trees stick a tree every tree needs to be coverable why are you the thickest boy this one is you can hide never mind behind it literally like the only thing that's getting saved here is the thin sausage between your legs the thin sausage little sausage these these trees are way too thin don't talk about things being too thin all right enemies wait is this pride rock jack where i am yeah there's a couple of pride rocks there's one here oh i've just been killed then one all right that's it all right final game final game bloody hell

afterwards after the stream i'll restart and see if i can fix it because i've got to do a stream tomorrow and the day after as well and i don't want to go through this again because it's quite frustrating watching this side slowest gun in the game literally slowest gun in the game what's going on down there i killed a man down here and then there was another man in the tunnel yeah he

go wide left isn't he [Music] there's a guy coming down now give him give him a second marked him again oh great timing i was a different player yeah you guys came for you quite quickly quick quick response oh god that was meant for my angle i haven't even made lag yet um all right i'm gonna have a look at this vista down here windows vista yeah sorry did you want me to splat jack's gonna have to go back to windows vista if this carries on you've probably got even inside the bullet oh god i need a cd drive lucky i mean you know go to go to any relative's house above the age of 40. steal their cd drive you might find one yeah right they've just rested on top of me i don't even know if it would work is this is this lighting correct i don't know if there's a will there's a way you know and you wouldn't want to be windows vista and it's like 16 cores what's going on here but it's running as fast as you can i got good guns i don't know i mean this is as much money here but the thing is is the buy station it's a parachute station unfortunately oh that's good that's good that's good hey look at this look at this all the way it did sound a bit like that lucky didn't it i appreciate that i'm on you i'm on you i'm inside i'm inside the core the core give me look at this hey uh on that one any more cash a little bit cash let's go i mean the round's been short so i've got to do what i can to recover it that means he's going for a plane that means he's going for a plane i mean to be fair both times he did go for a plane we don't know i need to choose a location why don't we just wait until this loadout comes 500 meters boys let's go 14 10 seconds and we get loaded up are there people still up for the meme yeah there are people up at the moment yeah but look load out there's three of them load out where's the loadout it'll come in and it'll come in a second why isn't it now because they've changed it so now it's not and now it's not 15 seconds before the end of circle one i think it's now at the end of circle one come on i don't see it did you lie to us cameron i'm sorry [Music] we've got people near you let me let us know oh down here no no we need to get in their loadouts closer to us as well go go go make sure to use the automaton ultimate on you get stuck on so much stuff man yeah i'm stuck yeah they need to do a little back then into a pass on that i'll do a pass on this game rdl study [Music] nice shot i mean what gun are you using there stud uh that is the mosin three three line rifle or something okay so to avoid confusion you know yeah to avoid confusion of knowing exactly what gun it should be we've given it another name so push back up push back up i mean this is the worst angle we could ever push from but yeah let's do it that's probably rocker that's where it is yeah i mean look at the cover if we get spotted oh god they're on the floor yeah they're watching they're watching they're watching we probably shouldn't push this this is like if we keep going left keep going left keep going left we've got cover we've got cover we've got we got we need lucky lucky kills they've got the flat cannon lads they've got the flag cannon we need them you're gonna die then aren't you have you no i'm just like yeah i don't even run up half this hill yeah i don't know we have to go up to this road and use the road i don't know this seems too obvious it seems too old down right helena right one dead right where's the other one oh they're down [Applause] there's one on the right one on the right side one on the right yeah he's on the right that's death won't play guys follow jack you were there for moral support this person has an automaton i beat the uh the rocks i think like that's you complete it again like he's just instantly killed someone without there was a man in the sky oh oh there he is guys mark mark mark mark oh okay okay okay red marker there was a guy there okay they've been 3d spotted on the hill guys something and then we need you to come back this way okay because there's a guy on red marker yeah i'm swinging around this way purple rocker purple marker there was a guy there purple rock me and jack are pushing in the open i'm gonna make up our way okay where are they where are they i mean you got your 3d spots i mean he was right there he was right on there and away well i mean there's only pride rock left you down the hill maybe here is here it is jack here's pride rock we found it i hear shots to the south west south could be them red building maybe uh i can't open this supply crate yeah that one that one's bugged in the capture event as well you got a guy here all right it doesn't seem that far from up here you know okay no you can't get it it's absolutely ruined i think we see someone pushing in there from the north but there isn't i don't see anyone on the road or anything earth here guys marked my marks mama my mama done him actually you started yeah look at that playing together that was sick i finished with the play team i think there is someone in that red bull then yeah on the purple mark you can get further up this hill okay here comes lucky it it it looks he seems pretty fast when you actually get scoped in oh you've got a whole team on this buy station area here yeah i've seen one guy on the hill he's there i'm on the shooter where down there on the red mark running across the hill there's a guy standing completely still just below him it's completely still nice on that key [Applause] there's the down is the afk yeah he's afk there's a team just infinite yeah yeah but the one player is afk lucky there's a second one back there red marker marked him i mean stop we may have to parachute that would off this for contract gameplay towards him i mean we probably should we got a loadout as well whoa that was jack yeah they got their loadout down here down someone's nice nice that's still jack's shots coming in okay i'm just looking i might try and land on top of that i'm trying to look above here marked there's one down that's one down finish for jack i'm looking for any others i don't see anyone else people fighting here watching don't see clusters different squad cluster got me if you quit camp behind yeah i'm calling to you come on there's a different squad i think what further down the hill yeah i see them start there there there you have it red mark red mark there you go there you go play immediately a meaty plate that right on the red yeah he just disappeared you got a team on this buy station whole team this is weird no no no no there's definitely a guy in this dip somewhere here studs seen that guy two of them i can't figure out the sniper where is it there's one to the right right right yourself he's self-resting that guy at the back studs the one i don't know yeah yeah i think we'll get him got a nice one nice lucky we got that one we got sniped from the red there's a player pushing from the red marks yeah jack you're right the footsteps is terrible but then oh i mean snipes instantly what he's done staying covered down and we missed the fire sale in all of that as well by the way [Applause] just feels a bit jank doesn't it the whole thing i don't know it's like it's been uh it's it's missing that layer of polish like the audio is not very good in terms of direction i can't stand the scopes as well my sense is completely messed yeah it's pretty poor you should have anyone nice one jack where that where's that jack we're carrying that [Applause] we got a guy over at the a cannon over here on orange there's a guy over here [Applause] found one enemy active enemy uav okay like the scope like moves around by itself yeah yeah it's really weird like a jitters you know what i mean stop yeah yeah it goes in do you do like do you do a lot of scope holding or not like do you use shift to hold no not really yeah i do a lot of that it gets rid of it but it's certainly not the best i wonder if you can enemy negate that with attachments i bet you can is it when you just step left and right when you step left and right just jitters you see what i mean it's like like 80 80s oh you got a guy on orange yeah yeah we're gonna have the parachute down he's here there's defi fighting going on straight in front of me yeah we're gonna go far right far right far right go far right trust me yeah going through the trees through the trees i'll try and down a couple of them give you some time it's fine they're in that building a mouse just ain't by itself again cool i'm being told man i swear i'm being trolled yeah raven now that one nice finished nice swap played oh lucky i mean i made the sacrifice sacrifice behind me on that one oh my god that was good yeah i know i'm just saying it's all instant it's an incident an international i could have maybe got you lucky oh no i'm on the edge of this i'm on the other hand it's not the zones too strong he's in the zone as well are we dead uh i might be dead let's do yeah you are dead the zone moves a lot faster than it used to right yeah the zone moves so much faster i mean i can't keep up with it you can't outrun the zone which actually i think is a really cool poor design that's poor design and also what happened was right was everyone just waited for the edge of the zone and then just shot each other and then no one could run away from it yeah one more no i'm done yeah that's cheap i'm unlucky if you want see from guys uh i'm gonna end it there for today um thank you for watching uh ran into a lot of bugs today um it's it just i mean we got a couple of wins but i just felt like i couldn't get everything dialed in my mouse is playing up okay i kept like getting stuck on invisible stuff um i don't like the scopes i need to like learn the weapons and attachments because i just don't know how to build these at all and i haven't the only one that i've got max is the stg man so yeah um there it is appreciate you guys being here what do you think um stephen the the warzone guns will be in tomorrow so at the moment it's only available if you have access to vanguard um so that's why you can only use the vanguard guns but tomorrow they're gonna put a normal battle royale playlist in where you can use vanguard guns modern warfare and cold war um i'm not a fan of any of those vanguard snipers especially the scopes i don't just the way that they feel there's so much visual recall on the vanguard guns as well i'll have to get used to that or just use like some of the older weapons um i need to fix my mouse as well like i don't know what's happening with that but it's very frustrating just being in a firefight or just about to go into firefight and then it just right clicks and aims and just completely messes me up you know um i'll try and fix it because uh like i said i've got a stream tomorrow and the day after so uh we'll see um yeah a lot of learning to do some of the sounds were bugged as well um game froze a couple times we'll see do i know if flv is coming for console i don't apparently it's not in at the moment but i know that they mentioned it in the past i think console players deserve to have an fov slider even if they accept that their performance will be less i think it should be an option right should be an option i've got the latest biospend i don't think it's anything to do with my motherboard it might be something to do with my usb ports or like g herb and restarting it definitely needs a bit of fine tuning map definitely what do you think of the map layout it's fine max um again need to get used to it need to learn it figure out what the hot drops are what the good drops are i don't think anyone expects it to be perfect stone but um this has been a long time coming you know brand new map for war zones pretty big deal but we'll see like hopefully there's an update tomorrow because you there's going to be a new playlist usually when there's a new playlist they might push a client update as well no we get 24 hours early access to play vanguard br zip mix any modes like rebirth coming yeah rebirth's gonna be in it's the old rebirth map as well they didn't make a new rebirth map for this a learning experience for sure indeed help desk indeed what's the fact bernie how's it going man are the graphics any better than the dance about the same i mean there's some new assets i'm playing everything on low though for performance so i don't really care about graphics yeah i'll check bartos i'll check cute boots though yeah for sure did i get anything in the battle pass what did i get let's have a look i didn't even look through this f oh look at that is that a weapon charm i have to pay respects i'm going to put that on all my guns there's a vanguard blueprint there a couple of skins here relentless a pos canara skin blueprint there i didn't even use that bar anti-tank rifle yeah that's one of the new guns isn't it stg is that a garand auto shotgun mp40 i think i got skin is that for the type type 28 or dpd i don't know the guns that looks insane what though guardian slayer oh my god look at that it's got like a goblin actually it looks like gremlins
