look at this collection of them here oh they all disperse the hell your name is so this is full progression full xp the whole shebang my turret doesn't seem to want to attack them now what's that massive lmg noise it's the pkbms it's stupid the disappearable zombies sometimes it just randomly teleports a zombie into the sky but yeah it sucks them up into the sky and then parachutes them down they even whilst they're shooting them and they're on the ground it's like a counter cheese mechanic maybe is that van cheeseable most sounds cheeseburger actually anything that's off the ground is basically cheeseburger say hello to my little friend this is dumb this is so stupid that was instant fun he literally oh my god there's so many in that building right now have you seen that building yeah they keep landing on the roof and they're not knowing how to get down i think yeah i'll just keep getting my pkp mastery no complaints from me we've got a perfectly safe house over here again this is lovely the thing is i reckon if more of us go there it'll change their behavior i don't think they can get in i think that's it have you seen the roof by the way i mean oh they're just queuing to go up there's a party of subscription having okay jumping through the front window i born you i'm bringing many they're like there you go i'm staying here for a minute here you can't be out there this is the room this is the sacred room they're basically the two and they just simply they line up at the window can i come in yeah oh yeah i mean we might need to you might need to go through the back window jack i would say you ready well i'd go through the back window jack honestly yeah it's more clear accept me can you get a jack and clear these yes all right and then you just simply hello everybody that's so dumb look he's just spraying all the fight it's horrible they literally just can't get in here really but they could they can they i've seen one mantle through the window but they do have that ability it's just not very common i'll bring them off the roof guys get ready okay oh my god i didn't get i'm getting them off the roof yeah we had to clear them off the roof occasionally it won't come down though they're stuck beamer the zombie calling begins oh no god they nearly had me then is that why they won't come in because they're turret you want me to i don't know did you say oh no what happened then oh my god what did freeman do i think he just blew up the house he's around us don't worry there's a replica of this house somewhere on the map yes they're all down here hi

i mean they've got silly levels of health now what the hell he's in he's right he killed him he's a god what is going on i can't believe this is real i need the turret needs to be somewhere where i can actually hit them it'll be so funny right if this messes with the anti-cheat and a load of people just get banned there's too many roof people up there now we need to clear do we need to be on the bus we need to leave let's go with freeman clear and then we'll come back in the roof is insane [Music] they can't leave the roof though they don't understand how to leave the roof do they yeah they don't figure out how to jump do you add incendiary nades honestly we could just burn them all you know what to do boy what have the smoke there oh we're coming back in the bus i don't like it out there stack what the [ __ ] hell are you doing i regret my decision i'm not doing this for another hour time there's no way oh yes you are we need to see what the extremity the max extremity of the game is i want to be rescued i feel like we've earned rescue no there isn't there is no rescue no this got to be it said there would be i'm just saving it alone they take a [ __ ] load of damage this

artillery flames look at the roof even when they get in though they don't seem to damage you that well it's got to be a you get to a kill limit and then it goes you win is that why wouldn't they put that in though no look at the bodies of people what oh god that's horrible jack i'm gonna have nightmares about this look at my burner oh my god there's so many look at that this is horrible 1071

staring they just they just jump they're just observing us yeah they're just watching the murder happen we will remember this for the sake of ai yeah when we're judged by an ai in the in the in the coming years i'll be a recording of this the thing is i instinctively say thank you to siri sometimes like just because i'll be like sorry what's the what's the temperature and it tells me okay thank you no i i won't say thanks to robot i refuse and that's why i'll be the first to die in the robot can we please finish now it's like 1200 kills well we do it then that's it that's that's the
