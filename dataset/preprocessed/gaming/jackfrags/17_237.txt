pistol there both no hello two of them hasn't been much new since the announcement of the delay unfortunately still no bait today either it's got to be october now looking at the calendar but a couple of the developers tweeted out there that's a friendly tweet out their thoughts after the delay it does just seem like the delay is for bug fixing because they could have delayed it whenever they wanted right oh hello i'm jumping off uh that killed me wow so that's true it's just a bit of an agonizing weight really in it it's gonna need that dude does it even reach there yeah it does [Music]

underwater interesting oh this is just starting to look like a trailer now i'm okay with it i'm sure there's gonna be plenty i mean the helicopter there and i just bounced off my teammate not so much of a trailer moment there that's not how you revive people there's gonna be so many more moments like that in 2042 just without sandbox that game looks i'm gonna hide here for a bit i've got control on that roof ow i always wondered you know what if you could um like defeat the water and electrify it like that imagine if you could kill people that were near you with the defense i finally got a
