spider-man mars morales is really really fun that's how i thought that i'd intro this video i was very lucky sony sent me a playstation last week and i've been trying a few games on it mars morales is one of those games and now the review embargo is up i thought that i'd make a video talking about it showcasing it a bit and talking about my experiences so far with the ps5 and the new controller so i'm one of these people who didn't get to play spider-man when it came out in 2018 on the ps4 i do have a copy of it i've just never got around to it because i was just busy doing other things so for me jumping into this game experiencing the combat for the first time just the swinging around the city it's it's so much fun so while i wouldn't say that this is just an expansion for spider-man at the same time it's not a fully fledged release where you'll get like 30 40 hours of play time you can do the main story in around seven hours and then there's a couple of hours of collectibles after that but it is a completely new story experience obviously we've got mars morales learning how to become spider-man doing his thing in this video i wanted to focus on the graphics some bits about the gameplay ray tracing and just the overall level of fidelity in this game so you should be able to watch this video in 4k and i'm playing mars morales here in the fidelity mode which is a native 4k render 3840x2160 locked at 30fps it looks absolutely incredible i was playing this on a large tv with hdr turned on just such a phenomenal experience and it felt like the most next-gen console game that i've played so far digital foundry have done a few tests on this and the fidelity mode doesn't appear to have a dynamic resolution so it just stays at native 4k and keeps that consistent 30fps with ray tracing there is a performance mode that gives you 60fps but that is a dynamic resolution and it can scale down a bit plus you lose the ray tracing but it still looks really great having a 60fps option for this game incredible when you're swinging around getting into fights it feels super smooth but for this game i'm sticking with the fidelity mode 4k 30 with ray tracing the raytracing just adds so much to the game when you're crawling on the side of buildings you can see you're on reflection you can see reflections of cars driving by the pedestrians on the sidewalk going about doing their thing the puddles on the ground reflecting everything the headlights adding to that it's just a gorgeous game and because of ray tracing it comes to life and i was just messing around in photo mode here because this scene in particular when it loaded in and i was walking through the market i was like damn this looks like one of those videos that they show at e3 when they reveal a game for the first time and then the game comes out and it looks nothing like the videos well this game is that video but it's real and in photo mode just looking at the texture of everything mars's hair the skin the jacket the fur around the jacket and then you look at the sweater or the jumper as we call it in england and you can see the knots on it it looks like a different texture so good very impressive indeed and really this isn't a game that's been built from the ground up for next gen because as far as i know this is taking what they've built with spider-man in 2018 and applying some next-gen fanciness to it so if you think if this is how good miles morales looks on day one of the next gen consoles launching how good is the next god of war going to look how good is uncharted going to look if they bring that back or the last of us if naughty dog continued that series it's cool man this game has really got me hyped and i think it's a great showcase for what's possible on these new consoles and what i've just described it's all without any loading times it takes a couple seconds to get from the main menu to your saved game or to start the game and then there's no loading when you're swinging around if you can't tell i am kind of blown away by this but that's how i feel honestly the gameplay too absolutely love it like i said i didn't play spider-man on the ps4 but the combat is so fluid swinging around the city amazing love it you can do tricks in the air and everything and the story and the cutscenes too i actually care about the characters i think the writing is very good here the voice acting as well i don't know if they've mocapped the faces but they all look natural and realistic the whole package just very polished loved it the controller as well it really feels like you're adding something when you're playing this type of game it's got all sorts of haptic motors and new vibration shenanigans going on inside it and everything that you do in the game has a different feel if that's just running on wood or metal running in the street swinging in the air swinging through a tree that's all going to feel different in your hands but the coolest thing to me about these controllers is the triggers and the triggers have resistance on and the game devs can decide how much to apply based on whatever you're doing in the game you don't really notice it that much with the triggers in mars morales but when i think about potential uses for this if you're playing an fps game you could have it so every single gun in the game felt differently let's say you've got a massive sniper rifle 50 cal or something that could require a really hard trigger press but then you've got something like an smg an mp5 and the devs could make that quite light on the trigger they could even go as far as blocking the trigger so let's say in the future there's some kind of super hardcore tactical fps game on the ps5 your weapon jams and then the r2 trigger is literally blocked you can't press it down but that is instant tactile feedback that's sent to your brain and you think okay right i've got to go fix this jam yeah it might come across a bit gimmicky when i explain it like that but once you use it it's just cool it just seems to work really well with the ps5 they included this astros playroom demo and it's just a showcase really of everything the controller can do and it has some awesome things in it like when you're pulling the rubber strings out of the ground the resistance changes as you're pressing the trigger or your character in the game morphs into a spring and you can feel the tension of the spring as you press the trigger down it gets harder and harder when it gets the bomb then you release and your character springs into the air in mars morales if you're running on the ground you can hold the right trigger down and you can feel the power or the energy building up you release and then he shoots into the air and you can start swinging between buildings there's another bit in astros playroom where you're on a raft made of ice and to push the ice you have to blow into the controller because it's got that microphone the harder you blow the louder that input is the faster the ice is going to travel and it all adds up to something that feels new an experience that you've not really had before playing a game the controller does have a speaker in it too as the ps4 controllers did but with the new one it feels like they've increased the volume and given developers more options to use it so if you're playing on a tv or you've got a surround sound system you're not wearing a headset you're going to notice contextual sounds coming out of that mall that's my impressions of the controller really like it as for mars morales i think it's brilliant it's a great game i think it's a fabulous time to be a gamer right now we've got two incredibly powerful next-gen consoles releasing next week loads to look forward to and now the games will look better they'll run a lot better and you won't have to wait for things to load good times with that said i'm going to leave it there for today guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below have you pre-ordered a ps5 or an xbox one series x or even an s looking forward to getting your hands on it next week maybe i know they have been quite difficult to get hold of both of these new consoles but i'm sure that they'll get more stuck and hopefully anyone that wants one will end up getting one before christmas at least fingers crossed as always thank
