hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking a look at call of duty warzone season five i do apologize for not posting a video yesterday but i've been away all week in london doing typical touristy things had a bit of a break so i scheduled some videos so i hope you've enjoyed this week's programming schedule so far and i got back home late last night and i didn't really have time to put a video together i didn't just want to rush things so i jumped on this morning play some games with the lads and i've got some first impressions of season five and a bit of an overview of everything that's changed and stuff that's generally interesting uninteresting that kind of stuff now before we get into this i want to take a look at a recent tweet from raven if you're someone who's been playing warzone regularly in the last couple months or so you've probably run into an excessive amount of cheaters especially if you're in those higher skill based matchmaking brackets myself personally the last couple weeks especially in solo matches if i play in the evening more often than not it's every other lobby and i did record some more games where i was playing against cheetahs but i did a solo match i think it was the previous warzone video before this where i was killed and i just walked away and i let the gameplay play because the guy was obviously wall hacking and i've had similar matches like that since then but i thought well what's the point like i've done so many videos on this topic before offering suggestions and feedback ideas my experiences with the game other people's experiences with jesus so i didn't post those videos but we did finally get some form of acknowledgement from raven that there's a problem i guess they've done a couple tweets like this in the past where they say okay today we banned over whatever accounts and they posted this on the 11th today we banned over 50 000 accounts in warzone more importantly we are listening and hard at work behind the scenes we will have more info for you soon that's a bit more than what we're used to here so i'm hopeful that that means they've been developing over the last couple months yeah whatever it might be a more robust form of anti-cheat whether that's an in-house colonel level thing or third-party anti-cheat coming in but that gives me a bit of hope that raven understand this is a pressing issue and we'll see what happens with this in the next couple months one other thing that came after this ban wave it was being shared on twitter that on cheetah forums people were complaining that previously they could get away with using hardware id spoofers ip spoofers and they could just make a new account and play off the same pc but a lot of those cheaters who had their accounts banned and made a new one were just getting banned again and again so it looks like they've hit one of the biggest hardware id spoofers out there for now that's a good thing but that's a temporary stop gap right and whatever this thing is that they're working on behind the scenes it's got to be good because whenever new content's released when the new card game comes out and there's an integration with warzone if there's still just a load of cheaters that's going to be the dominant messaging on social media on youtube forums whatever they've got to stamp it out so fingers crossed they've got something good here okay so warzone season five new battle pass new skins customization all that usual stuff but there are two new guns as well the first one is the tec-9 and that's an smg i haven't really used that much starts off semi-auto though and you have to unlock a certain barrel and then you can change it to burst or full auto i think it's got an integrated suppressor in it as well from what the boys were telling me earlier but apparently it's just okay it's not gonna replace your mp5 or your mac 10 or anything like that so you might not want to bother with it the new assault rifle however the em-2 this is a beast i was using this today i haven't maxed out yet but i was picking up the people's bills who had bought one of the blueprints and just do a few attachments on there so this thing's got a built-in optic it's really slow ads though but it means that if you wanted to you could put an extra attachment on there but i think most people will end up going with the three times axial it's a very high damage high recoil gun it can be a five shot kill and the headshot damage on it is ridiculous but the recoil is equally as ridiculous so i think this is gonna be a really high skill gun especially for pc players who can control that recoil a bit easier kind of reminds me of the amax when it was really good maybe the odin back in the day when that was slowly creeping into the map for a bit and then quickly overshadowed by high rate of fire weapons but em2 is pretty good feels nice i'll probably do a full game play on it at some point in the future check it out there's been a few map changes as well there are these weird crates on the map scattered around and you go up to them and they make a really loud noise there's a bit of wire connected to a generator with a number on it don't know what they are i imagine it's something to do with the warzone storyline leading up to the reveal from the new game not that interesting though as a poi the red doors have changed a bit too so sometimes when you go through a red door you'll end up in a corridor with a load of red doors in and you can hear adler and stitch i think speaking narrating over the top this whole idea that the dance 84 is actually a simulation in adler's head or something like that brings a bit more evidence to that but you can pick a door and sometimes it will put you in another red room sometimes it will put you in the sky and you just parachute to the ground but there is a situation where you just don't do anything and you hear a countdown and you get teleported out there and you can see a bell like a picture of a bell for a split second i don't know what that's about but again probably related to the storyline could be an active easter egg in the game at the moment although i've not seen it go anywhere right now another change which is quite cool i think for overall gameplay is if you use the repels you know recently they've made it so you can go up after each other really quickly well now you can actually cut on the line so let's say you start going up one of the zip lines but then your friend goes oh there's a guy camping it or there's a mine up there or something you can cancel the repel so you just press the use button again you'll detach and then you'll jump off so it's pretty neat i like that feature good quality of life two new perks as well one of them is combat scout which just gives you a little wall hack when you tag someone you can see them an outline of them for a split second but you can counter it with cold blooded i think and i've got a couple nice kills tagging people then shooting through walls with this kind of cool not sure it works great in war zone i don't think it will be a meta perk and the second perk which goes in the middle slot that will replace overkill and goes for most people is tempered and i think that this will be a solid choice for a lot of people and it allows you to refill armor plates to full with only two plates instead of three and when you equip it it will automatically refill your armor and you might be thinking well what's the point of this well each plate instead of adding 50 armor will add 75 armor so you still 150 armor in total so it doesn't give you more armor overall than if you had three plates it's exactly the same amount of armor but the fact that it's only two means that you can get back into the fight quicker if you want to be fully plated you can just go bang bang you're back to full and you go and it also means that your plates will last longer if you want to run around on full hp get what i mean that's a good perk i like it and it's going to be used a lot and that's it really i mean it feels a bit fillery this season there's not really that much going on if i have to be honest with you and i'm sure that it will evolve for mid-season reloaded and then towards the end the build up to the new game i think there's another season after this as well before the new game launches which is typically october november so not really that exciting to be honest not much changed and the new pois just aren't that interesting to be honest so there it is do you let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you've played it what do you make of it and as always guys with it being a new season if any of you decide that you want to pick up the battle pass or get any of the new skins or operators do consider using my code jack frost in caps in the support to create a bit down here and anything that you purchase i'll get a bit of kickback from that it's entirely optional but it's a great way to help support me and thanks to all these guys who've been on the screen last few seconds for doing the same thing and that's all guys leave a like if you enjoyed the video dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one guys i forgot there's an incredibly annoying bug in the game if you use a keyboard where your input gets stuck and it will just make you walk backwards forever i don't think this happens on controller but it happens on pc usually when you interact with a buy station or a loadout but i've had it happen to me when i'm just fighting people so who knows raven please all right see you next time bye you
