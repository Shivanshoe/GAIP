welcome to call of duty war zone in this video we'll take a look at some gameplay and explain everything that this has to offer so this is a free to play standalone battle rail game based on modern warfare however you do not need to own modern warfare to play this anyone on PC Playstation or Xbox can download this for free tomorrow March 10th and play it with each other if you want to as it does have a cross-platform play integrated it has two game modes battle rail and plunder 150 players per game with battle royale being the main one what we're taking a look at today warzone battle royale has three options for you to play solos Jiro's or trios and in typical BR fashion the players spawn in on a dropship flying over them up and can choose where to drop this is how the map looks broken up into various zones and you'll notice that when the round starts the safe area out of the gas is already marked on the map the developers say that this massive map has been custom built from the ground up and features incredibly detailed interior and exterior environment you may also notice some of the ground war and spec ops maps here too as well as all the Call of Duty Maps dotted around such as terminal scrapyard broadcast and overgrown when you drop out of the plane the only loot that you have is a pistol with a few magazines so at least you've got some way to defend yourself if you happen to get into an early skirmish but of course dotted around the map you will find different weapons gear perks and cash sometimes just on the ground and other times in boxes that you can crack open the weapons in warzone already have attachments on them and come in varying rarities there's no need to equip or remove specific components you get what you're given what can you do with that cash then well a few things if you find a buy station at these stations you can purchase equipment field upgrades kill streaks or revive tokens for fallen teammates here's a list of everything that you can buy right now with their relative prices another way to earn cash is by completing contracts these can be collected on the map and offer up three different objectives bounty recon and scavenger bounties we'll pick a player for you to hunt down and eliminate recon will have you capturing flags and scavenger will have you searching for three specific crates if you complete these during a match you will get rewards such as cash rare loot and a weapon XP I mentioned previously about respawning teammates one way to do that like I said was if you have enough cash and get to a buyback station however there is a way that you don't teammate can bring themselves back to life and that is the Gulag when you're eliminated in warzone you will be sent to the Gulag and see a short cutscene in here you can run around and spectate players having 1v1 battles while you wait for your turn in the queue you can also throw rocks at the competitors - if you're feeling a bit naughty when it's your time to fight you will be dropped into the mix it's a small 1v1 mark with a flag in the middle a bit similar to gunfight now if you win this you will be respawned back into the game with no more second chances if you lose well you better hope that your teammate has enough cash to respawn you or it's back to the lobby screen warzone features vehicles after all the map is massive and these are a good way to get around or chase people down at the moment the vehicles on offer are the ATV the SUV the transport helo the cargo truck and the TAC rover what about the health and armor system then well you have a health bar and up to three armor plates can be worn at any time it's very simple your health auto regenerates if you don't take damage for a while like in multiplayer and your armor will be depleted as it takes damage you can carry up to five armor plates in your inventory at a time and there's a short animation for replacing them if you're low on health and need a quick boost you can find stims around the level to get it back to full more quicker than usual the most expensive item that you can buy in the game is a loadout drop marker for $6,000 this will mark a location and deploy a Supply Drop allowing your team to pick up a load out which includes perks one other cool thing about warzone is that it has unified progression with modern warfare so four players that already own the full paid full version of microsoft as items operators weapons and customization will carry over to water and all progression earned in warzone will count towards overall modern warfare progression so you can use it to level up and grind weapon XP also for players who don't own the full version of modern warfare all of the progress and items that they earn in war zone will be rewarded to them in modern warfare should they ever choose to buy it in addition war zone shares the same item shop and battle fast system as modern warfare there are no loot boxes here all in all this is pretty straightforward to be honest and I think what a lot of people were expecting based on the leaks and rumors that we've had for this ever since modern warfare came out last year really I love the fact that it's free-to-play in standalone I think that's great the loot is simplified that time-to-kill looks fast environments are cool we've got modern weaponry I think a lot of people want a BR game like this and it's out tomorrow there's no like crazy lead up time or overhyped marketing it's just there now the player base for this will be huge no doubt I think it's going to make a big splash right now is there doesn't appear to be much hype for the other already established VR games at least at the moment now based on what we've seen so far I can't wait for this to release and I'll be live-streaming it tomorrow on YouTube when it launches it looks like fun to me I do have a couple of concerns and requests I suppose one would be for man squads I just like playing as a four on VR games and I think it suits the game mode well second would be I don't like how frequently people are appearing on the mini-map here for a br game does that make sense maybe not third I'd lose the two air strike kill streaks and make this just about gun skill primarily and forth playing devil's advocate are there going to be hit reg issues and lag here with such a big map and so many players and also with it being free-to-play I hope I really hope that the developers have implemented a solid anti cheat system here and our doing hardware bans to stop repeat offenders either way it's going to be really interesting to follow this one and I hope the wars only supported long term as a Live service title with regular content there's still a lot of question marks here of course but if all goes to plan it looks like call of duty battle royale or war zone as it's now known is off to a promising start with that said I'm going to leave it there for today guys but I've cut up some best bits and highlights of the gameplay footage that you can watch if you'd like to without my commentary on top if you enjoyed this video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you strike a 3-1 good copy see the circle it's not [Music]
