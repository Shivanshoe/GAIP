check this out they actually added bots to warzone that fight you this is something completely new you know last week when they added the 80s action hero event and nakatomi tower appeared in downtown well if you go under the ground near the tower you'll find this expansive new parking lot and in here there are ai bots to fight there's even a little mini juggernaut boss and some rewards to get pretty cool and i'll show you how to do this later on in the video and i wonder if it's a precursor for more things like this to come also the k31 swiss the latest marksman rifle in the game now that the developers have changed the attachments like the suppressors barrels nw laser etc this thing beats the car 98 in my opinion it's got great bullet velocity incredibly fast ads speed and a decent default crosshair it's the new mid-range sniper king this is the build i was using you don't necessarily need the gru suppressor either but when i've got that unlocked i'll test it again as well as adding the airborne elastic wrap on the grip so today playing with acolyte and tommo we had a brilliant match here experimenting with a few things and exploring some more it was a good one for sure if you find the video entertaining guys hit that like button below thank you it's a great way to help support me and cheers to all these guys for using my code in the cod store with that said let's get into the game now sit back relax and enjoy one's here right here i still don't know my way around this place okay my gas broke him down damn that was a head shot holy is that your level guys he's dead

don't know how many that is hey siri how many babies are born a minute one moment is it okay i found this on the web for how many babies are born a minute check it out 250. so if there's 250 babies born a minute is there 250 warzone wins a minute depends if those babies are playing the game i guess well they just take them out of the womb pop stick them on the xbox they just reach on in there they extract the child just to play warzone mission past that's a lot of babies geez yeah but if you think about it quarantine's only made that number go up yeah literally dude my friends obviously
