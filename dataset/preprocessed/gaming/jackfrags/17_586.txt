no joke of a lie hand on heart attempting to win a game of solo hype escape on pc has been the most challenging thing that i've done this year forgetful guys forget warzone solos hyperescape takes the crown it's been a tough few days i have to be real with you now before we get into the video i do have to say a big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one hyperscape has released now it's free to play it's on pc xbox one and ps4 and if you're interested in checking out yourself there's a link down in the description below now with this being the sponsored video it's got to be good i've got to keep you guys interested i've got to keep you watching i have to deliver the goods and i thought to myself well obviously i'm gonna have to get a win because that's you guys want to see the wins that's what it's all about putting on a show getting a win and if i didn't get a win i wouldn't have done this video but hype escape on pc i don't know what it's like on console but on pc it is one of the most fast-paced competitive battle rail games out there at the moment the people that play hyperscape regularly are really good at hype escape and then you've got me casual gamer in i go let's try and get a win it didn't start very well i have to be honest [Music] i'm dead i'm dead that guy's got 11 kills go for the slump and i'm dead got him oh that shotgun is good oh god this game's so difficult slowly but surely i realized that i had to experiment with different weapons i had to use the different power-ups and i found out that the magnet is actually not bad i wrote it off at first i was like a magnet nah it's no good but in this firefight for example i'm chasing this guy down i've got the advantage he jumps away i'm pulling back with the magnet forcing to land on the roof he's done worked out great and so my confidence began to grow just just a bit okay got him started these fights are so sweaty aren't they kind of really concentrated to win them i feel like there might be someone in this colosseum type building [Music] got him things were starting to look up for me maybe i could do this the sniper rifle quickly became one of my favorite weapons but every time i would get to end game i'd always get taken out by a better player [Music] hello [Music] boom i'm going to this step here really really hurt me i was in the top 15 and there was a lethal melee event which means that melee is a one-hit kill dude just slides towards me and clubs me in the face i think i slammed my desk at that point i was beginning to think that it would never happen even my in-game character started to berate me this is really bad and she was right that round i didn't even make it out of the zone killed by nothing but my own incompetence i needed to take a break but the next day i came back and this was the best game that i've played so far i started to see some improvement in my gameplay i think i should keep chasing oh god why did you come back oh i'm low he's low i'm going for it that was a mistake yes i have got to go stay down there 20 seconds nice bit of health he's like 200 meters away surely i've got this guy come on oh my gosh two people fine right here i'm just going to chill down here get some health back we'll be all right 10 left it's kind of a bad spot though isn't it down here well that kill was stolen nevermind you know what i am just going to chill in this small room with my shotgun and if anyone walks in here they're getting a face full of it you can hear someone stay away get back oh hello nice everything's falling apart oh he's fine here's my channel another room let's go come on come in oh you're in my territory now mate hold on that's a bad move awesome all right one guy left the crown is in three seconds i'm gonna go for it pick it up get up okay oh god no no no no no i've never been more upset my world came crashing down i was sure that was the one and i was 10 seconds away from quitting but something inside me said you can do this get back on the pc try again and so i queued up and this happened shotgun sniper that seems to be the meta so i'm happy with that first kill in the back what are you doing you've got the high ground and an explosive oh god mess up [Music] come get the other one the low gravity event is about to start two easy shots there i missed okay low gravity is perfect right now [Music] yes what about that other guy over there no i'm just gonna no i'll be lucky to hit that dude underneath me i'm slamming right i'm just going to go to the zone that's my plan i'm going i can keep him a bit here push too far away okay right max damage shotgun that's perfect oh please oh man that was close i got the advantage i feel like i should just camp it maybe nothing oh i can actually fuse that [Music] that's a lot of damage let's try and get him oh he's got the crown i've got to stop him i don't know where the other guy is yes okay all right pick it up look at my health only two contenders left i can't let this guy hit me oh my god he hit me right i think he's above me the extra jump event is ending i don't really wanna fight i'm just gonna keep running he's right on me i'll just keep kiting him in this building i should be all right well you can see exactly where i am come on come on oh no no no no no no no no no no three seconds two seconds one second yes oh god my heart i feel like i'm gonna pass out i am not healthy i actually feel like i'm gonna pass out my heart is pounding i think i'm okay oh man we got it we got the win i'm so happy i am so happy yes and so that's where our story ends i only lost about three years of my life in the process but it's worth it for a good youtube video with that said thank you for watching guys big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one like i
