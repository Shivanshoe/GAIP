hi everyone hope you're doing well today i've got an absolutely awesome solo buyback match in warzone season five buyback is what stimulus used to be called and as long as you have four thousand dollars on your inventory when you get eliminated you will automatically redeploy it's a load of fun and people camp way less than in normal solos and tend to be more aggressive in their playstyle and for me that works perfectly i am still getting used to the new map after playing a couple of hours last night but really enjoying the changes so far with that said let's get into the match now if you like it leave a like and your thoughts in the comments below sit back relax let's do this it's gotta be stadium hasn't it it's gotta be i feel like because everyone knows they can get a respawn they're just gonna drop here there's quite a few so many around oh man i'm coming for you the noah's spread what where'd you come from oh he stole my kill that's not cool nice car though anyone about i mean look at the mini map yeah i'm gonna keep this car someone else just shot me then oh that didn't reload like a fake reload or something still someone here oh that guy was really low oh a key card give me give me here's someone outside i don't see anyone there's definitely someone right here on the pitch two angles oh come on nice shot though i've got to go straight back i must have revenge oh someone just dropped there so you can do this snakey bakey no damn ruined what do you have p90 that's a growl isn't it yeah i don't mind this hello right next to me come back goodbye where's that from up in the box i think yeah um i don't really have range with these guns so moving mark it just in case i'm gonna move get out of here the stadium is so cool it is massive though ages to run around it i like the fact that these windows are here and you can propel up too if you want did i just see someone drop then it's a different guy i'm sure i saw a parachute then maybe my eyes are just plain tricks on me i don't know i'm gonna try and get this load out though no one around hmm there's someone watch the sky it's probably their loadout come on peek well they're not gonna have any plates up there [Applause] was that oh there's a sniper out there where'd you go there's one here that's him can't stay up on the roof forever i feel like every enemy drops at least one plate now have you noticed that or is that just am i imagining that all right i'm a bit wary of that sniper out there i don't think they're there anymore get me some plates in the uav i do need a bit more cash now though for the respawn let's have a look two guys fighting up there i'm gonna push him why not [Applause] i'm a little fight the guy the top one i think right here good night ignitions box hit the heartbeat instead oh there was a dude right there how long was he watching me for it's like slenderman stood over there i don't like that let's get into the uav is he in the sky i know he's right here [Applause] literally on the other side of this wall same skin unfortunately didn't get the guns what's next moving here someone just up to the north west there's someone down here too i'm gonna go for that one i don't think there's much color down there is there so could be an easier kill where are you there you are mark the target trying to go in that building we've got a good position there can you even get in that building isn't that the one with the keypad on was the worst thing that you could have done though no one else on the left bit of cash thank you very much there's someone on tv there enemy marked gas is closing down the range unfortunately are you still there yes you are need to get down to the left i think that god wanted me didn't he did not give up you know i'm gonna catch a ride on the train no vehicles around so that's a really easy way there we made it to get from a to b without being in much danger doesn't like there's anyone here i feel like a filthy stowaway well it's going into the gas so this is the last stop let's check this building nothing all right see you later train oh there's someone there i don't think i should really shoot at this distance though because enemy marked usually there's people up in these buildings here not as if by magic there is i'm just going to creep up and try and surprise this guy [Laughter] oh my god you kidding me suck a fart that's a great name oh my god i should have known i did i literally called it as well what options do i have not many they just sign houses next to each other try for that recon fire stage no there's going to be someone in fire station isn't it i think just dropping the uh the shoot house here try and get a gun there is a buy here as well if i need it and it looks like this hasn't been looted i'm very surprised by folding's not bad but the uh the iron sights on it sucks fun i feel okay about this i'll tell you what though as soon as the respawn closes soon i'm just going to buy some plates more important at the moment because as long as i stay alive for the next one minute 40 there won't be any respawns after this anyway little tip as well something you can do in solo is in 2000 quads as well pick up a bounty and it will just give you some information roughly about where someone or one squad is you don't have to go for the bounty but it's intel that lasts a few minutes so it's it's worth doing loadout i really want to go for that [Music] we're clear there all right i'm going i'm just dropped in there i don't really know that i'm here revenge that was the guy in the house that was the guy in the house wasn't it same name give me that grave mine now give me a break please are you gone i think i'm gone i'm going for it i'm gonna get my ram ghost because i've got that growl if i can actually pick it up when are they gonna fix that loot i've got two good primaries here hello come on go if you load up gas is moving mistake ouch i was considering getting the raven out then and doing the finisher but probably it's probably a bit too risky at this point well the zone has ruined me here we had semtex in there probably better at this point than c4 not gonna be any vehicles around you would think i'm pretty clear right now but i've got to move up ahead and there's oh they're fighting over there it's a bit of cover here i think this is in as well i swear i just saw a guy run into the fire station then as well five remaining they're still fighting over there right someone else just died then so i know i've got one guy up here and i think the other guy's in the fire station i'm just playing right on the edge i don't really want to waste that yet there's a gap in the wall there so a bit worried that they're gonna just push out the last minute i've gotta watch out for that window as well at fire station thank god you didn't have a selfrest he's right there it's the last guy now screw this suck on that yes oh the semtex came in clutch awesome i love this game mode man it's so much fun so good you can take a few more risks and that suits my play style more right excellent guys i hope you enjoyed that if you did leave a like if you didn't a
