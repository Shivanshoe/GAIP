be using today also going to be matching that with an mp40 as my secondary we'll see how it goes and today as well the ricochet anti-cheat went live for everyone in the world so fingers crossed we won't but bump into any cheetahs today are we nice wouldn't it when i played a little bit of war zone since the map came out a couple of streams couple of videos i'm yet to come across the cheetah

redeployment uh scruffy cooper carbine apparently hopefully i can get my load out in this first match if i want my view like here stay sharp you'll be out there soon is an effective way to mess with the enemies i want to spray these heavy rock eat my f oh you've gone you want some f come here let me give you there [Applause] okay don't give me the thing yeah i'm giving you the air you're on [Applause] [Music] and drewdog are playing you just caught up with them i think we just playing solos tonight blue monday hey jordan irish don't really support a football team i'm honest with you anyone else having a really high penguin playing warzone recently um it's been okay for me so far cooper is nerfed did they really know if it already martin my ping yes are you not using a vpn or something automaton is nerfed yeah i've heard that stefan brindley how you doing hey eric randy yeah this thing is horrible what even is that like that's broken as well i don't like the look of this guy krampus krampus hunts the naughty defeat him for a one-of-a-kind calling card so that must be in warzone so will i just find krampus will that horrible monster just be patrolling the island i mean how does this work guys let me know in chat that's a little elf destroy the elves listen for their laughter don't get close nate cheers for the five green george bush it does look a bit like george bush doesn't it it's a good point strange isn't it really weird use a plane immediately in skadoosh am i actually in the game here what's going on a bit we'll be deploying soon [Applause] oh the event isn't out yet okay irish no krampus yet right it's a bit weird that it's there then in it [Applause] i mean that's got no recoil on it i'm not even controlling that you guys see this okay it starts to go up there after maybe like 30 bullets you just put a bit of downward motion on your mouse oh that looks quite laggy doesn't it [Applause] 130 ping that's not ideal is it what's up chris can you drive dressed as a christmas tree i don't think so alfie's cast [Music] yeah it's the cooper we were looking at it the god gun this is the build right here is the sudden aiming bug still happening murray no no we fixed it today apparently yeah i don't want to play with 130 ping i don't know why it put me in that lobby what's up roulette hey dude you've got that problem jack my ping was high yeah some people in chat were saying that they keep getting put into like hyping lobbies [Music] it's funny to me that cod gets no flag for having over the top christmas stuff um what's card in it like i think it's a bit more acceptable for it to have goofy stuff have you seen the car 98 glitch it can be semi-auto isn't it just a build urine [Music] it's just a build you can make isn't it hey johnny any news on 120 hertz for series x use this i've not heard about it paul i think that it should have it because the dance had it didn't it next year and eventually they added 120 for series x and ps5 right enemy dropping into the ao oh my god [Applause] see this is nuts maybe i didn't give this a proper go on plunder earlier what the hell [Music] and that ttk enemy [Applause] you get the idea [Applause] there's a bit of an open bolt delay on it though which is not great [Applause] maybe it's the specific build that i've gone for [Applause] they've taken out already up there okay what about santa for this year i don't want anything blunder i never asked santa for anything practice is over i just want you to be happy that's all right that's it man that's what i want for christmas i want you lando to be happy playing on pc james yes standing for a like comment and a subscribe gas is approaching your position get to the safe zone and t can be fun cash drop on the way i think this feels like a better server yeah 50 ping that's european it's not a uk server we'll see how it goes hey audi do i think battle royale games will continue to thrive in the next few years or they're just gonna disappear i don't know i think there's gonna have to be some form of innovation in the battle rail space or someone releases like a perfect battle rail game i think battle royale games have a shelf life though especially for the casual gamers for the large player bases you know the majority like they have this amazing period the first couple months when they just release where everyone's having fun and learning the game and it's much of a sandbox but then meta start to form the casual players drop off and the game just becomes incredibly competitive i think all battle royale games end up like that i don't think there's any way to change that you know getting new players becomes really difficult after a while targets are up take them out difficult problem to fix that tommy gun [Applause] what is that oh that's a cooper close range i'll keep the sdg for now what is that g43 i'm surprised that no one came for this scaffold to be honest a delirious start thank you for becoming a member hey greg like i've never been here before this is all new to me objective sound move to the next location nice looking brent [Applause] are you still looking at me no no i'm gonna get away i'm just standing there and taking it i feel like i should push that guy they called something in what the hell [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's a different guy the sniper wow hopefully i don't get headshot really difficult to say up there i'm gonna move [Applause] who gets that vendor for you that vendor for you [Applause] kind of regret dropping my smg there i didn't mean to bogdan thank you for becoming a member favorite drink oh okay [Music] stand there supply box ready for [Applause] and location this building dead silence say [Applause] and then i'm gonna get a uav from the by see if there's anyone around but you know that at this point no one's got ghosts [Music] someone's been here already six thousand as well can we get area recon uav getting fly over [Applause] one guy up here and down here location go for the one on the low ground maybe and this guy's just chilling in the house [Music] in this big house here you got gas inbound safe zone relocated uav is out of fuel returning for resupply [Music] tell you what that guy nearly had me someone outside as well 160 on the loadout okay we're gonna get under the uav [Applause] we're gonna get that cooper carbine [Applause] uav is out of fuel returning for resupply right here are they targeted you're losing ground moving target is definitely not friendly rally point mark for you fight really difficult to see there got that cooper let's go i was solos feeling it's interesting because i think a lot of people are still learning you know oh [Applause] oh nice cooper and ppsh is better welcome to the gulag i'm not live on my pcs i need to get it done [Applause] i've already seen some really good recommended builds for the ppsh as well this guy that i watched called pony hoff who uh did a good video i think it was earlier today what was it yesterday when he was over smg builds [Applause] can i go back there i don't know and over here and stand for that scout pb got nerfed too ppsh was knocked already really i need to read the patch notes use safe zone highlighting my station costs are adjusted supply box located moved to secure it's a cool area the plates thank you big game bounty i'm already on the supply contract though stuff maybe i could get that later apparently you get a load of xp for that mg4 is this the one that like oh they've actually changed it okay i just gave my position away there you're losing ground moving keegan need a bit of physics on that come on i'd like to swing for the buy if possible the gas comes in [Applause] new objective identified nice there's so much noise isn't there on this level like all those planes flying overhead not a big fan of that yeah get the free i think i could buy a uav but uh maybe i should only 1200 we got return on the way uav beginning fly over no one on this side unless i've got ghosts we use the world at war buildings yeah this is um i'm sure there's a level in world of war that looks like this not the exact layout but those style of buildings right uav is out of fuel returning for [Applause] contract resupply all supply boxes found [Applause] i'm a daddy i think i can buy a loadout now as well [Applause] every box you open is extra xp for that gun remember that guys get a kill with it this time heads up lads cash drop inbound thought it was underrated it was a good game i don't have any decent sniper builds though guys so i don't know how i'm gonna fare to be honest with you uab is out of fuel returning for resupply look there's just so much open ground here that i've gotta cover i could take that truck but it's gonna give my position away [Music] and i've got an mp40 is my smg [Music] [Applause] do i use high alert no but i should put it on this class i think that's a good point actually i know it's going to be really like butch for this level isn't it let's be honest there could be like five people looking at me here hopefully i don't get stuck on rocks that's happened already can you max out the graphics now i just play all unloaded i'm at a disadvantage here too because i don't have ghosts lots of other people in the lobby will have ghosts now so see how it goes do you think i can get up here no it doesn't look like it what about up here nice oh no come on that's really annoying forces you to go around you know it's one thing that i don't like about this map it's just there's a lot of running uphill don't vote me wow nice girl i died so fast then come on guys mr century thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly i didn't get to use the cooper again guys hey i'm gonna change my loadout i'm gonna put high alert on a high alert on the first class probably better than ghost isn't it to be honest [Music] let's go without um [Music] then i could just pick up someone's smg if i kill them maybe i know [Music] how's auntie i mean it seems to be working so far right did you guys see that dr disrespect is opening a game studio [Music] that's quite interesting here's the two nick he said yeah up david jack it's not dice i thought dice made this game did ice not make this check your gear and weapons we go soon oh man when you get someone like that you do fry them though [Applause] it seems like the bug is fixed as well which is good he's i think there's a guy called robert bowling who's working there as well he worked on a lot of the cod games like he's one of the godfathers of cod there's a couple of uh decent fps developers in there be interesting to see what they come up with battle royale gas is approaching your position is the game will optimize i'm getting 200 fps heads up lads cash drop inbound i do have a top end pc though so know if you go peek the mix go pick what's up own sense how are you doing oh my god there's a lot of people here yeah i don't quite fancy that anymore so we've gone down here kill all targets go okay [Music] just like stood [Applause] [Music] is that there going to chase me i expect so [Applause] he's still chasing me some guy right in front of me oh wow what you beat me there keep the car there nice flick to the head survive to one redeploy i eat the yeti thank you for the two not [Applause] fight your way out and you return to the front line i've not heard anything about it and you're finished it's time soldier break up oh that flick though i think i got lucky there hey bunny get to the mark location and defend it i get scared when skating down the hills feels like you're gonna break your legs yeah kind of well i don't know if anyone's here thank you william appreciate you being here man cheeky ladder sdg is better what's up slim jonesy hello adam supply box located moved to secure that's not my supply drop though is it [Music] volk did i even unlock that it's such a grind to get the vanguard weapons unlocked was it car yeah i'm good thanks gregory you draw all good now yep it's all good thank you 10 10. and they've really got to turn the volume of those planes down secured job well done you're well [Applause] i'll done this bit down here see what's going on hey richard enemy uav active assist it was on then oh hello big bag of money holy crap that was a lot of cash right there i usually get that much from crates can we get area recon [Applause] this kills me i'm just gonna rage off the page fine uav is out of fuel returning for resupply [Applause] locate in a supply box secure that position that's tricky [Applause] did someone else just beam him then i feel like someone else just killed him [Applause] [Music] anyway i'm gonna go for my loadout i don't really want that fight 300 meters away what the hell streaming card is possible now yeah so it would seem hold on to your butt oh this is so slow what the hell time to cover your tracks this enemy team hunting for you [Applause] and they should improve the speed of these cars and that feels horrible [Applause] [Music] okay very slow that car hey jim you know what i don't need the bazooka do i bazooka every time i say the word bazooka i have to say that enemy dropping into the ao you've got gas moving in where it's on right here sounded so close yeah that ttk is mad gpsh custom yeah but the fact that there was a bomb drop down here leads me to believe that guy's coming up the hill triple threat on me though [Applause] it's gonna reach [Applause] oh the dude missed us off what's up cole jack i have a question so warzone on the xbox series s has huge problems do you know if it'll get fixed anytime soon i've got no idea cole sorry i don't know buddy i assume if it's performance issues they're probably well aware of it but that kind of thing usually takes you know a long time to fix because i don't think performance problems are something that you can fix with just a server-side patch so imagine if it needs optimization on console it might take a while but you need the bazooka yeah bazooka would have been good though wouldn't it actually shame i'm not really used to pbsage daniel on some death any painfully complex easter eggs yet discovered in 2042 nope i think they were too focused on trying to release the game in time rather than you know putting complex easter eggs in easter eggs is usually they do it in their free time and i can't imagine that the devs had much free time before launch you know considering the state of the game when it came out but yeah the consoles you know the performance deserves to be good on those platforms because a lot of people play warzone on all consoles but you have to remember that this game is available on the original xbox one and playstation 4 and if my memory serves me correctly the original xbox one came out in 2013. so that's like eight nine year old hardware so you know trying to optimize for that time to see what you've learned maybe it's just not possible i wonder you know if they do war zone 2 next year if the supposed modern warfare 2 releases are they just going to drop old gen and just have warzones next gen only because you think by like october november next year a lot more people fingers crossed would have actually been able to buy the ps5 and series x and s this christmas dessert you know what i'm not really a big fan of christmas desserts i guess i mean christmas pudding's okay but i'd rather just have like an apple pie and custard or something you know what's up slim thank you hey eric conan tricky duck thank you for the five how is the switch version this isn't out on the switch gregory i don't think warzone would run on the switch and if it did it'd be like 480p 20fps or something problems in all the consoles okay i'm not going to get that enemy soldier nearby targets are up take them out where'd they go [Music] [Applause] 16 bullets i was wondering how you got it there's a ladder i'm on the shooter maybe i shouldn't have engaged there with 16 bullets i'd like thank you [Music] there's someone up here as well i don't really take that fire that distance you've got gas moving in [Applause] bro bro chill chill enemy dropping into the ao [Applause] they're on that tree [Applause] okay interesting i'm stuck i'm stuck [Music] there's a guy in this building oh damn it okay [Music] [Applause] if paulina's dead you're dead interesting fight here i'm enjoying this is what warzone does best man these kind of fights but still got that player over there need armor [Music] oh you're gonna come over here no okay how am i finding the optimizations it works really well on pc the frames are made get rid of that pain there's someone in my discord server though who said that they can't even open the game on consoles so my idea hopefully they can fix some of those initial problems ever played hunt showdown wow yeah i love fun showdown it's great i've done plenty of videos on it as well i've got another one coming out soon actually some highlights [Music] what am i walking into here random shotgun there okay let's loot this this is the difference between not getting a scavenger contract at the start of the game and getting just going to contract you basically have no money like all those fights that i got into as well like it didn't really drop anything [Applause] [Music] here we are pushing up a hill again do you want the loadout goes gas is moving in incoming bombing one now why does that stun you away oh that sucks i just revealed my position as well even though i didn't do anything wrong not sure i like that [Applause] [Applause] also where'd you go [Applause] that's my oh my god cool i think that guy already had the loadout i have any plates i'm a big disadvantage here what options have i got though i've got to go with my loadout really don't i got gas moving in get some plates sorry my friend thanks for the place okay they were expecting me to come over the hill there goodbye someone parked that vendor [Music] enemy uav active need that air support this is phoenix three striking bow [Music] [Applause] on that one well this guy is really doing my head in i'm giving my position away big time here visibility is really difficult my station costs are adjusted [Applause] i kept running okay god that thing is so frustrating i hate that horrible horrible mechanic maybe there's a cheater in the game just 30 remaining ah i think that's unlikely use the bazooka [Applause] enemy uav active hey tyler thank you for becoming a member [Applause] just be ready yeah i don't think there's a cheer in the lobby i just think like that this is the way solos are you know even on the new map the lobbies dive quite quickly [Applause] what is a bombing one adam it just randomly picks a player and just puts a bomb on their head it sucks prove you can still fight so i hate it anyways in the game got a scavenger contract here probably not a good idea going there there's an a vehicle down there look they got a heavy beach can i land on it and shoot the pilot i'm just gonna go for something cheaper there like [Applause] i don't think it's gonna pay off but whatever doing it for the content okay supply box identified marking location now telecover americans i'll be mean that one you know guess it's moving in you save some highlight i'll take it like this if i can dump an airstrike on someone for the memes doesn't look like it does it tell me i can get back up to this buy please oh dice i want to buy i'm stuck i want to buy a loadout dragonfly custom the hell was that have to go somewhere out for the loader he was the guy that got me earlier up there okay uav as well can we get area recon uav beginning flyover [Applause] you got a sniper back why not seems all right so there's a guy at them the mines he's right there uav is out of fuel returning for resupply killing this building enemy uav active i hate the fact that i'm on all those uavs it's interesting though because the way they change the parks it kind of forces you like enemies there's a lot of good perks in that middle throw now to the new safe zone gas middle column sorry damn it i might as well take that objective is to eliminate the belly target that's this guy right here okay eliminate the battery target location mark for you guess is right on your tail this is going to be interesting these guys are having a fight need that air support this is phoenix iii [Music] this guy's probably got a gas mask [Music] [Applause] i don't have one no enemy hits on that run i'm not a big fan of the snipers need to learn them very different to the mw snipers [Music] only ten are left only ten left okay big circle for ten let's see [Applause] yeah a lot of xp if i kill this guy where are they [Applause] that bombing run nearly got me as well [Music] oh you're a lucky boy you are a lucky lucky boy get to the new safe zone gas is closing in there's still two people here got a guy in here and a guy down there that's the bounty as well isn't it [Applause] out here oh that's cool when you did okay so if you do that bounty just gives you a usb that's interesting is that an advanced uav as well what that's kind of crazy [Applause] i'm stuck nice mark that vendor for you down here lots of people at the top that's like a real-time uav what the hell does that show me ghostly players as well he's right here somewhere dude this cooper carbine is insane i mean i understand now why people were saying it's like the new god gun like that totally makes sense man that's nuts that time to kill you've made it to the top five smashing what the hell would really do with buying a gas mask no new safe zone highlighted i can get a sulfurous gotta go uphill again cool cool need some recon out here oh everyone's gotta go [Applause] oh i'm screwed i'm not the only person that doesn't have ghost in the lobby so there we go yes it's inbound i love myself master i don't think there's anyone down on this left hand side i think everyone's up here in sneaky i'm gonna get shot in the back uav is out of fuel returning for resupply [Applause] i'm just gonna wait here hopefully i can hear footsteps those bombs go away let's see no one's died i think i'm covered from up here as well worst thing that could happen is someone jumps on me with an smg then i'm dead i've got players i'm gonna fight over there that'll be a kill any second or three left [Music] i'm a bit of a disadvantage though because i don't have a gas mask but i do have the zone it'll be a nice head glitch here [Applause] ah [Applause] good try my friend now be the win i'll take that thank you very much got a bit lucky there because they ran into each other capitalized as best as i could [Music] [Music] i have to be honest when i saw that that guy had a right shield i started to get worried i was starting to get a bit worried there being honest with you these i mean these solo matches are so tense man hey i'm not like i might have made that look easy but it's really difficult it puts a lot of pressure on you as well ggs guys thank you for watching i think that's um what is that does it show you how many wins you have on caldera no it doesn't shame i think that's my fourth win maybe oh uh atlas thank you for the 20. wakanda cheers for the 19 months eat the yeti thank you for the fireman the full talk of me leg meter yeah you guys want to see the loadout this is what i'm using now i think one of these is vital at the end it's either that one or this one i've not unlocked it yet when i get that you want to put that on i'll stream at 20k anthemic for 1440p 4k 50 50 000 i just max it out there you go that's the build i was gula again wasn't i as well yeah lost a fight good start to that match as well you guys enjoy that hit the thumbs up button if you did thank you all right we're going again more pain eric cheers for the 17 months uav in the middle of the 1940s is my favorite thing about this game listen it's a game you can take artistic liberties right fund's much more important than realism aaron thank you for the 17 months [Music] thank you honey i'll say yes what are you thinking 2042 shield um no dozer shield would have beat me then because if those are crouches you can't shoot the legs i feel like i could shoot that guy's legs [Music] more pain bring the pain what's up adam chapman hey daniel [Music] did the cooper just get nerfed today david it feels ridiculous to me honestly it's not much recall it's very high damage [Music] yeah you can screenshot the build are you over battlefield not at all lucas variety's fun man i can't just play the same game every day you know i'd go crazy if i did that sam 28th birthday watching my man jack taking heads off hope you will sam thank you happy birthday t-bro [Music] do i ever play zombies i i did in the past yeah the zombies on vanguard isn't very good though is the one shot chest sniper still around that's the type 99 isn't it i don't know i've not leveled up the snipers at all i think the highest one is like level 20. hey ronnie soon so is this one free or you gotta buy vanguard no warzone's still free hostile dropping into the area [Applause] i've already done a video on your summertime daniel [Applause] well thomas sounds really good i've not tried it after the patch today though so i don't know how much it's been earth or whatever [Applause] [Applause] sounds amazing as well this gun looks like he just dominating sounds like it [Applause] oh my god you see how slow that went you see the travel speed on that what the hell what's up jack ross how you doing hey mohammad welcome have i heard how ricochet is doing so far steve i've played like four matches i think now and i mean i haven't come across any cheers i'm sure they'll find a way though you can never stop cheating completely but the fact that they've got a kernel level anti-cheat now is is a big deal royale rush to the safe zone you got gas closing in the bus cash drop lots of server-side altitude stuff as well now too they say which will make a big difference peak's the hard drop isn't it really i think you could run faster than that bazooka shot all right there's a lot of people behind me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] knife blows on them oh hello girls thank you for the two light machine guns people just getting the plane straight away should i go up here and die that'd be interesting won't it yeah the new anti-cheat's out now really no one here okay [Applause] there's a guy here targets in my sights can i go for these lads [Music] well i think i hit that guy oh god where did you come from dude oh my god hit that guy with one bullet [Music] there's still people down here so we're just going to drop in we'll go for a fight more interesting i don't hear anyone [Applause] this is a bit suss [Applause] [Music] enemy dropping into the ao [Applause] the plane got him what bro you just stole my kill that's [Applause] okay that plane is out for blood i don't think there's an anti-air thing here either they got a light vehicle please dice i should have waited there so [Applause] [Music] i don't think that was the same person [Applause] [Music] [Applause] can you please just die already that's the one that i saw earlier cheeks some of these guns are

carbine the one that's in the battle pass the new one i thought they were like in the water bit then that's my mistake too aggressive fight your way out i didn't need to do that front line you're finished fight your way out of this or capture the objectives [Applause] i think that's a revenge isn't it maybe got a scavenger contract here still slaps after the patch yeah still really good you think that was another dude i yeah i agree with you actually because i broke i broke the armor on the first guy oh that's just disappeared there's someone here i'm presuming this guy's got loadout so if i can kill him that would be ideal yeah not a great gun though is it for distance the height advantage though yes it's moving [Applause] am i stuck down here okay we're okay [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] 21 bullets there's another guy further left i ain't dead yet picky situation here oh god [Applause] how many were left in that lobby we spectate who wins there's only eight people left uh paul suzanne thank you for becoming a member where did the grenade go it may have fell down the hole seven left should we watch this one out guys see you wince so you can take it [Music] you want to watch it yeah okay this is the guy that killed me this is right next to the bounty that's hunting them as well yeah colonel's live now basic bob property cheats live everywhere that's an easy kill surely [Applause] dave is rocking seven kills right now mp40 though not great distance lots of open ground here so close that gap rally point for you when did you mark that over the loadout that's risky that's really open there get an assault rifle yeah there we go good job [Music] oh unlucky yeah there's a big risk going for that loadout i think they needed that assault rifle though she's got 12. this guy's gonna win i reckon using that cooper carbine as well that's the meta build that's the one that's the final one that i want to achieve when i get the other unlocks for it nice staircase on the left ready when you are 1v1 i don't think that's going to kill anyone that airstrike it shouldn't do anywhere [Music] take the daddy take the daddy why don't you say oh man this other guy is just going to be waiting in the bush somewhere no cover at all could be underneath though oh spiderm yeah i think this guy's going to win stun him and push air strike coming on just dodge that [Music] got a little heady here i both got headies though okay maybe this other guy isn't so bad oh my god he's got the down getting cover and rest rest splat oh no he's alive how did you survive that dude run underneath right now run underneath how did they survive that fall i should have killed them [Music] although they're screwed now i think if the zone moves behind them they're fine if it moves up and away from the beach they're screwed okay right and that's 50 50. although this dude's got the high ground above him there's no way you can hear footsteps either because all that ambient audio oh he's coming now run away the other guy's gotta run now make a move why didn't you make a move dude you gotta make a move they just stayed there they just stayed there guys they should have just made a move then you know the guys in the gas on tg another fun game that was a bit of a crazy finish wasn't it [Music] [Music] your narration makes me want to top 50 warzone clips part two maybe one day i feel like that content for war zones had it stay though you know like it served its purpose you just impressed jack frags and 5 000 people as44 has no bloom after the new update is that true cody [Music] a new god gun isaac yeah there's a new god gun every week on this channel don't you worry [Music] i still haven't got vital [Music] they get ages to find a game i feel like svm is just in overdrive [Music] late night evening wednesday europe full sweat hey pooter do you edit your own videos i have someone else like some streamers i edit everything myself pooter i make all the content myself exclusive ace just tweeted it really i like him he's cool exclusive ace [Music] it looks like ads spread bloom was completely eliminated in war zone with today's match it's gone up to 84 ping now what is going on [Music] you think because the attitude's in now all the cheers have been banned that the player base has just like plummeted need a host on n a servers maybe soon maybe soon [Music] he's wars on the fortnight copy um no i wouldn't say it's like fortnite isi [Music] no i don't have an editor max i do everything myself a lot of people just make that assumption i don't know why i know a lot of streamers have editors but i don't think i could let anyone else do it because i'd just be like well it's not me then is it there's nothing wrong with having an editor though like it can be really useful for like taking the load off and you know having other creative people work on your content but to me i'm too much of a perfectionist and i'd just be i'd watch the video that someone else edited and i'd be like ah that could have been better that could have been different so yeah i'll just do it on myself taking ages to find a game how do i feel about allen wake too yeah i'm really really into it i mean i played the original alan wake on xbox 360 when it came out [Music] all of twitch went down today probably because ricochet banned all the cheers [Music] hmm i'd rather have longer time searching for a match than cheers [Music] i've not played any of the halo game campaign yet mark no i need to uh i need to get on that i need to get it done destroy the elves listen for their laughter don't get close can you use mw weapons and cold war weapons now in calderon you can't david but not in the game that i'm playing i'm just playing vanguard well uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do i like this vanguard rail i like that it's new i like the fact that you can't just pick the metal weapons that you're used to like that makes it feel a bit fresher for me you know [Applause] how slow that is obviously new map as well that makes it more interesting time to see what you've learned you get this on the wii no you can't get this one on the wii i think jack only reads comments from market priority areas he never seems to know his mind what does that mean kendall market priority areas oh she beams what's up jackson yeah the audio is pretty bad right now paul like the ambient sound of all these bombers above make your way to the safe place not been to capital yet capitals probably uh capital's probably awful for solos because it's just going to get campy but i think we should do it because i'm not being there hey dorian thank you i really like the bar it's slow but it has no recoil and the bullets above it interesting and again need to level up it's just massive grind i haven't got time to level the guns up a big building isn't it can i get loot up here it looks like it [Applause] kill all targets go in one garand no one's ever gonna put that in my loadout [Music] unless it gets broken one day i reckon is there not a ladder there isn't there horror game now [Applause] that's better i like this area whoever was underneath me has stopped making noise gas is inbound and i wish that was a um [Applause] i swear now hard just like me thank you all for have i ever played mmo type games i have i get bored of them they're not engaging enough for me i don't like the fact that this guy is still underneath me but whatever let me go for this got a scavenger contract here i won't be camping hard on stream now can we what the hell's that shotgun there's a dead guy here don't like that supply box ready for pickup oh this area is just full of rats i can tell it's just rats everywhere i'm gonna get shot in the back and killed by one of them this is scary contract updated new objective identified new objective identified hello i love that there's many many many many many many many men here really on top of that roof okay [Applause] oh no how do i get my game to look so good i don't think this looks good it's all on low graphics location when i'm playing at 1440p streaming at 1440p is that what you mean [Music] enemy uav active enemy uav active enemy you're over here i feel sorry for that guy's voice contract complete all supply i'm enjoying this new sensitivity though oh i mean i've literally never seen this before there's a basketball court here community day next saturday from [Applause] find out in next week's episode of warzone mark that bender for you okay i want to get through though i want to get my own uav sulfur as maybe enemy uav active gas is closing in relocating the safe zone oh no it wasn't this one okay need some recon out here uav beginning flyover friendly loadout drop on the way okay i wasn't expecting that [ __ ] airstrike before that guy gets to it let's try target right here uav is out of fuel returning for this issue they didn't [Music] good realize on target enemy dropping into the ao don't like that [Applause] no thanks to the 20. [Applause] don't find me man happy holidays [Applause] you're losing ground move it that was a different guy so if that first guy that i killed wins the gulag they're gonna come straight back here locate in a supply box it's a weird racket how are you doing enemy uav active now he's not the game why is that landed there there's nobody there is that just rng okay i don't like that mark that vendor for you it's a plane man [Applause] underneath if i want it ah nah too risky [Music] what does purchased mean when you kill someone i don't know what gun are you on my friend [Applause] absolutely turn to the front line but if you lose you're done fight your way out of this or capture it oh he saw my head [ __ ] i think he could see a lot more of me than i could of him the enemy won this bell yeah [Applause] the one that was hey mark had to choose between watching scary weather coming or watching jack kick ass i feel pretty good with my decision i hope the weather's not too bad for you there mark why can't we use the heartbeat sensor anymore it's not in vanguard royale you can use it in normal battle rail but it was nerfed a little bit though they changed it so it used to be that it pulsed every three seconds but now it pulses every six so it's definitely taken a bit of a hit a hobby sensor for sure what's my new sensitivity um i think it's 1.5 at 1600 aim assist just aim a system is really warm should i reinstall this up to ubs up to you buddy new maps are different i mean some of the gameplay changes that made changed the game quite a lot actually so yeah you might enjoy it you might hate it 50 50 i think at the moment in the community between like the loadout changes the new map a lot of people just really like the dance so i think the biggest issue you will have is leveling up vanguard guns if you don't have vanguard and even then it's such a grind these three i know it's a massive download though isn't it so a bit of a commitment practice while you can you've heard of elf on the show yes who hasn't heard of elf on the show why does it look like george bush i don't know it does so you're right hey edward so barry i love the hell let loose gameplay thanks for rotating that no problem man i've got another hell let loose video coming out barry [Applause] probably this weekend hey andy from los angeles what's up well i tried the mg42 no the only experience i've had with the mg42 is the one that was in the ground loot on like day one it was just shockingly bad [Applause] so i haven't really given it another look in but you know when it's leveled up maybe it's decent time's over a lot of the ground guns are really bad builds for some reason they just randomized it mg42 new metal rush to the safe zone you got gas i'm never going capital again i hate that place cash drop is inbound might be fun to fight over that i'm gonna get in the water i get a gun first probably there's a gun here targets are up a shotgun ah it's not what i wanted my money now before i get sniped 12 g right off the bat okay [Music] you did not see me there did you oh come on aim down the site already i had that guy dead [Applause] if you survive oh he's got my money now [Applause] i don't believe that's a real thing you're up next ready up [Applause] you win this fight and you return to the front line but if you lose you're done fight your way out of this or capture the objective [Applause] that's far far away supply drop here that doesn't belong to me it's a good idea [Applause] need some recon out here uav beginning fly over [Applause] uav is out of fuel returning for resupply [Applause] getting high in here what is that plane doing i'm gonna get killed by that what the hell the hot spa this is the world's most open buy station right here ladies and gents yeah as that guy just found out what these noises about dude i mean why i hate that it's scary can we get area recon [Music] a lot of people here location mark for you [Music] valley point mark for you uav is out of fuel returning for resupply [Applause] location mark for you [Applause] someone in that green building [Applause] enemy soldier nearby i don't really need to take this fight but i get bored if i don't enemy uav active the stairs here i think upstairs must be outside the building yeah it does sound like footsteps sucks all right's here nope never mind come out the front come on it's a camp off this is [Applause] i'm going i'm getting bored [Applause] gas is closing in relocating the safe zone [Applause] loadout drop inbound now probably still someone over in that building as well i imagine 500 meters away loadout are you kidding i mean i'm in a really bad spot here unless i can somehow get that truck then you know everyone's going to see me aren't they i saw you buddy come on run this way [Applause] no no forever [Music] it's so slow oh my god please just got no talk at all i beg [Music] i think their tactic was to just drive into me and nobody exploded don't i do it [Music] so need that air support that's your request cluster strike is active guy pulled up behind me there where did you go [Applause] and i've got a bazooka which is not ideal i'd like to switch weapons now please thank you i want to get that satchel as well if i risk it guys i'm gonna risk ah come on [Music] just crept up on me i think i overstayed my welcome there didn't i trying to shoot that truck when i should just uh should have moved on we don't talk about that chris watch the enemy vehicle guys i'm going to leave it there for today it's getting pretty late here i've got to be up early tomorrow so um thank you for watching we managed to get one win i'm a big fan of that cooper carbine though let me let me tell you it's good are you gonna shoot is that yeah he's right there what the hell shoot oh no on your left this is the guy that killed me oh my god hey why are you not sure [Applause] better play okay right we're going to show the gun build and then i'm going to get off bomb sounds make me want to leave the stream and stop playing now they need to tone them down adam they need to tone them down a lot so this is the build supercarbine got a nice one with it earlier very good feel free to screenshot that as i mentioned though there is i think there's a vital perk here somewhere you might want to change the grip out as well for the bottom one when you unlock it and this stock as well is pretty decent but you know that build the way i had it just no recall on it you know good high damage as well i don't know how it would fare in trios or quads though we'll see right once again guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed it hit the like a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one again i am a cod partner if you guys pick anything up in the store do you consider using my supporter creator code jack frags and caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that and if you do use it tweet me a picture and i'll put you in a future video if you want to do that of course right enjoy the rest of your day evening wherever you are guys i'll see you next time bye
