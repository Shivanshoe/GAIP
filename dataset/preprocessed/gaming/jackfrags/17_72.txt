how cool is this art style very reminiscent of 80s cartoons such as thundercats and he-man so this is a new game called myth force developed by beandog and you might know them from baldur's gate and neverwinter knights this time though we're going first person perspective with roguelike gameplay so each time that you die you'll have to start at the beginning however every time that you play will make you a little stronger with character upgrades the levels and enemies also change every time too at the moment there are four heroes to pick from each with their own abilities and i thought that it would be fun to play this with my mate tomo as he knew absolutely nothing about the game or the art style with that said let's get into the action now massive thank you to epic games for sponsoring this one link is below if you want to check out the game for yourself and do consider using my code jackfrags leave a like and subscribe if you're new here let's dive in whoa what do you think dude this is amazing it looks like a jungle book or like a an animation from the 80s hey man yeah it's very he-man you can smash these parts as well tom oh look zelda how cool is that what it's like a disney animation so it's procedurally generated as well so if we die we have to start again but the level will be different and the baddies will be different right and you've got those abilities as well skelly bobs take them out watch out for these red things they explode okay like that why would you shoot one so i could kill him but what if it killed me oh i knew that you're an advanced gamer and i would evade the attack okay you can sometimes get gold out of these as well these pots don't get much stamina do you nope although i've got a talisman thing that like buffs my stamina a bit a talisman where'd you even get that um just drop soft enemies yeah as you go through the game you just get off the enemies and then you go back to the main menu you can equip that okay so in theory your character gets stronger every time that you play because you can like upgrade your skills and do all sorts interesting yeah those are horrible oh that's a big explosion that one yeah so this is floor one right and if we get to the end of this level we'll go to floor two and the goal is to take out these three bosses okay you've got to have these goblins they steal your loot oh my god what loot my weapon yeah like if the goblin hits you it can just run up to you and just steal your sword or something yeah literally just take it away from me oh there's an upstairs here i'm just smashing pots it's quite satisfying walking the pot strap you just get money from them pots can drop gold i think sometimes they can drop like a health potion as well hmm i've just pressed c i've put up a character info thing it's telling my stats in the match yeah that's the stats of your character and if you look at the bar on the bottom as well you'll see there's like a slot for like some boots and some gauntlets oh yeah you've got some equipment there as well i appreciate how brilliant i am but it's a roguelite so oh god this guy's blue i think he's a bit tougher let me use my ability oh yeah i can do this what is that it's an owl that fires spells that's cool it's actually doing quite a lot of damage did it really the thickest difference 40 damage but that was but it's not in here there's a sword here but the damage is a bit bad compared to mine it's better than what i've got yeah you tell that see i've leveled up now as well so you may have done if you press t you can choose a perk an attribute you see oh like a card yep heal 50 hp now we've cleared that room we can go through to the next teleport that's cool there's a little click snap my fingers flew away i'm gonna use my portal ability here see this spirit realm oh yeah it should like suck them all in well the ones that are on the right level anyway like a black hole that sucks them in yeah ow i can do there's the arches that the ranger oh that sounds like the alarm from rogue one in star wars when you throw that do it again hang on oh it does hang on i need a bit more range it actually is it actually it does so tie fighters flying by dolby atmos let's go tie fighter goes past my right ear how's my left ear rtd r2d2 uh falling out of the sky [Laughter] that was good i like that one yeah okay um you see our health it doesn't regen either so you can get little health potions if you're lucky in the in the pots yeah i'm gonna put i'm gonna put this down i've got a bubble that i can put what does that do uh stops the ranged attacks from hitting us oh i see we do we do more damage in it out and the enemies do less and go slower it said so there's some kind of boss coming you see his health no oh yes give him an owl to deal with nice nah well you do so much more damage than that get down for me i mean my owl is more crack than i am so it's living the dream yeah oh my scallions more skellies god watch out watch out i suppose i could like use my teleport to escape yeah quickly click away leveled up yeah new perks available i can hear some oh no did that just open i don't know what that was it was a skeleton but it died right uh max hp plus 20. that looks good that increase your overall health yeah getting 30 physical defenseman sprinting killing five enemies grants you plus one permanent maxell stacks infinitely all right plus 15 damage with a spellbook i'll take that that sounds good careful of the flames mace oh the shield on the floor a shield is it good willful scale bane shield don't step backwards shield offers adequate protection against light attacks i'll give it a go yeah if you get your sword out now yeah you can block with that wicked blocking is quite effective say you fallen allies from the clutches of death like a respawn beacon yeah maybe okay onward look at this there's a fancy hieroglyphics on it nice isn't it yeah this is cool so you can play this with four players max as well there's a man peeking at us i sense a horny man i think he was in the intro wasn't he's one of the main bad guys or whatever all right we'll keep an eye out for him i'm your sword is sick it had like a green serpent glowing on the top of it i didn't see that it was a third person thing oh god it's a big arena i'm going up the top here i'll follow you where did he come from dude i didn't even see him i swear they just spawned behind you yeah it feels like it um what if i do yeah and then they use the the leaf things against him that blows up oh yeah it does damage yeah you can i'm sucking him in i've got an escape as well but i've not needed to use it yet where's my al algon he's gonna cool down this is a really good spot yeah well if you've got a bow okay i found one see they can go through the fire as well and be damaged by it you can bait them in oh yeah but some of them are actually resistant like the enemies have different resistances do i lose stamina by firing the bow yeah look at it okay hold it down oh it does regen quite quickly though this art style is just so unique you never see it in like top-down games no never like never uh first person yeah what does it remind you of fire ow um well it looks like old cartoons but it's also just looks like league of legends graphics but in first person yeah yeah oh man oh there's a spell there intense book of fire don't mind if i do intense is that the one that you've got uh yeah that's not intense book of fire oh god what's leaves all monsters okay oh a mushroom uh other mushroom it's baby groot in five years i don't like that is that what he becomes yeah a mushroom oh i guess teenage groot just uh put on a few pounds didn't he look at it die god these bows are good not much of a fun guy anymore there's not much room for him in this lobby and we keep on moving i'm gonna put a bubble down around us immediately fun guys okay on your way nice dude this uh magic spells awesome i have honed my are you doing it to me what's this the book do you mean a rare oasis in this shadowed land oh it heals okay oh big man big man mushroom man like mushroom man like mushroom i'm going to destroy these explosive things so i want to run into them you like mushrooms i do i am quite partial to a mush yeah a mush a mush i like um fried portobello mushrooms on an english breakfast you know love that yeah i'm not so keen on the texture of mushrooms but i like the taste next gate burning skeleton tank so when you say procedurally generated yeah do you mean the enemies and like the layout of the map itself or or just the uh each room is a new map it's both so it's it's the rooms and the enemies but i think there are certain points oh my god thomas doesn't say i'm gonna are we always in a castle yeah it's always this kind of fantasy environment but i presume that it's you know there's going to be different environments let's put my thing down again i'm over here where do i have it where's my where's my bubble you used it when we came in nope there we go it's up oh nice yeah but i think like the main story beats are the same so eventually we'll get to a point where we have to you know kill one of the bosses for example okay shield here put that in four it's amazing yeah i've got a mace we're doing all right you know i think we're doing okay yeah i mean we're still at full health i've gone through tom but i'll wait for you i don't know what this is there's a big sword in the ground who's gonna remove the sword from the stone pretty big sword all right what's occurring i was scared to go any further oh there's a big sword oh man's there again tom trespass on my domain i fire him firefighter do not grant him safe passage doesn't care you may take pride hang on let me get him right in the face oh he dodged it wow your incursion has come to an end my minions will deal with you my minions good luck oh my god is massive wait i've been i'm falling back a bit yeah we need some space i'm going to wait for my yeah we go up here go up here this is good this is good actually um i like where you're standing those spells they do man bubbles going up in a second oh god using my bubbles bubbles up bubbles up okay okay um i put my thing down slower in here oh man yeah these guys don't mess around no pretty cool here where's my oh yo i think i'm gonna try and line them up with that there's a skeleton with a helmet on watch out with you i'm trying to lock him onto me this guy i distracted my owl god oh the mushrooms don't like the whack let me tell you don't die don't die i'm about to [Music] my health's taken away god oh god i don't know how i get rid of this shield i don't want it bro oh i'm just whacking these mushrooms dude i'm gonna bow 30 seconds okay i move using my escape again what are you doing what's your escape oh my god i'm surrounded i'm trying to get aggro surrounded and i'm out of stamina ah thompson i've got a hill yeah usually yeah yeah yeah yeah good dude this is tough man what the hell i mean you have to try and sprint around them but you don't get enough stamina to do that like unlimited number of times right i think i put a thing down tom magic missile hit him with a spell oh are we good i'm waiting for my stamina to recover hang on i'll be good okay it opened oh my god i barely survived that are there any uh tomb things to open in this area i don't know man that was tough i got fully sandwiched by four mushrooms and they were not fun guys it was a mushroom sandwich i didn't want to be a part of a fair mace six damage on the bow okay this looks like a boss fight area jack oh no it's the merchant there's a guy just selling stuff on a table here let the revive yeah i thought he was going to attack me what's he selling he's selling a dagger an amulet i think that's random as well spend 5 000 gold for new shop items you can cycle them if you want new ones there you go what's that cool right floor number two tom wow we go deeper into the castle just four skelly bobs here i just said the same enemies for now looks like yeah yeah a bit tougher maybe that almost killed me i'm just gonna drink this health potion real quick okay 100 hp down to nothing uh it's the guy with a bow and arrow on the top somewhere drop down look he's here yeah he does 50 damage per hit he just rinsed you didn't um nice dog above still up there still doing massive damage gobbling on you i just saved your life you backstabbed me was it tell your mom i saved your life you get him yeah there's a mushroom here did not kill me bye bye banging him do you need hills have you got any nope if i find one how would you ask look of ice you want to try that one no you can take it i'll keep the fire for now because that the damage on that's pretty low that's what i was looking at i'll give it go all right oh jack you ready this is slow wait release yeah i basically freeze a path i guess uh that much you've got a shield there's no health around us there no no gonna put us in a bubble immediately yeah i'm gonna do that oh if you're done jackie i'll freeze him there's an explosive thing on your right watch out for it yeah i'm not sure about this old book of ice you know no further damage i'm glad they take the fire one any other day tom they're a weird lizard people weird lizard oh i don't like that uh hang on wait wait wait wait i wait for my bubble to come back it's almost there i could just bust in there and just shoot that thing you ready to bust yeah i'm busting i'm busting critical hit one of them did barely any damage so how was that a critical hit if i didn't build any damage down name's down in the middle several memes get inside flag oh excuse that critical hit from behind it's critical here it's a great quick quick no that'll be damn see if we start singing that skull man that's a tiny one stealth mushroom oh i need stamina back what the hell yeah come back stabbing are you using your bow maybe it's because it's like heavy or something deal with that owl there we go bash that mushroom to death archer over there yeah i think that mace was actually because it's a heavy weapon it was depleting my stamina more oh yeah that makes sense basically like doing a charged shot with a sword isn't it yeah little guy i'll scale these around oh god yeah i've got a big thing as well i just did three melee hits and almost running stamina yeah i want to get a sword back oh here he is still alive you must be more witness than you look to keep blundering through my land you should have turned back while you still had the chance he did before he does anymore i want to fight him i mean it sounds like we will do at some point oh god that was not fun [Music] i'm dead no yeah i can't touch this tom what do you mean i'm dead oh there's so many i got fully smashed have you got any abilities you can use no i i just use them all uh nothing to keep them at bay tom you got to kill them all i'm trapped in a corner yeah don't even try to revive just try and survive okay stay alive thrive i'm your opponent and you don't know it what are you doing right i've got to stay alive for another 40 seconds oh tom easy there we go there we go that's my escape you've got this how quick is that restore oh that's my longest call down nice i mean that's giving me an opportunity i guess to shoot them carefully about to get ability there you go god little man on your left no i'm trapped get away from me casting a spell on you be gone on the corner right we were oh there's a bunch of them riding around the column really yeah yeah they're waiting to surprise ducky okay you got two on one hp there you go last one's on one hp he smashed it spell left okay so no one else is going to spawn but i have to kill them i think yeah bob and weave there you go you're going to go skelly's now easy nice hold on jack it is the dancing sword wow it's like a bone sword on 19 hp song yeah i think i'm gone have a look in this room survive the whole two minutes over there on the left there's a rare station you can't touch this yeah you're back are you back i'm back i'm back oh god i'm in severe pain though yeah it spawned me with like fear like fourth hp people what is this man your mom what is this are you mental oh [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] i'm dead i'm dead jack you're dead there's so many enemies i spawn with like no hp i fell back to like try and read you and i turn around and there's like 50 enemies on me that seems unfair i mean why is this so many well that's it i mean we have to go to the start of the game now ah
