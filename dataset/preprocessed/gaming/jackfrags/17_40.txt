hey guys hope you're all doing well and welcome to some call of duty warzone sniper gameplay i had a couple of really great games here with the hdr and amax i'm really enjoying that combo for caldera at the moment with the snipes just hitting my shots winning some games which is all good now i needed to talk about something a bit serious with you guys today serious in a certain degree i suppose not that bad but i think that some people could be affected negatively and they could end up in a bad situation so i think that it's better that you guys are informed rather than not most of you like 90 are switched on and understand how this kind of stuff works but i do think there's a couple of vulnerable people who may not be as informed may not know about the scene as much and they could fall for something so we're going to dive in and there's a couple things we're going to talk about here the first thing is comments on youtube so this is a problem at the moment and other content creators have brought this up before but for some reason on my channel i see this all the time and i do try and keep on top of it hiding the channels that do this stuff but i'm very busy and ultimately i will miss stuff and some stuff will slip through the net you may have seen this already and i've got some screenshots here to show you what it looks like so on my videos of course anyone can make a comment and occasionally i do reply to comments and put pin comments up there and if i make a comment this is how it looks there's a jack frags in white with a tick and then a grey background so that means that that's officially from me and if you hover over it it will say jackfrags and if you click on that it will actually take you to my channel so that's a way of verifying that that's really me but in the last couple weeks what i've been seeing is people will take my profile picture and then they'll put like a little emoji tick next to it or something like that it doesn't look exactly the same but it looks similar and i'll put a couple of examples on the screen now and then they will reply to people's comments and say hey you're a winner you've won something dm me on telegram or what's up the number in my profile name and we can start talking to each other and i'll tell you about your prize that you've won and of course when they do that it's just a scam if you start speaking to them they might ask you for your bank details they've got your phone number maybe they get some personal information off you like your full name social security numbers address whatever so this is a warning don't fall for it it's a scam and i will personally never ask you for your phone number or put my phone number in my profile or anything like that or reply to you on a youtube comment and say that you've won something so make sure that you're vigilant and look out for this if anyone asks you for your number on my channel in the comments just ignore it maybe report that user as well or take a screenshot send it me on twitter so i can take a look at it and then ban that user from the channel as i said a lot of people will know what's going on here and they won't fall for it but some people might think this is legit so please just watch out for that don't reply to those people you may have noticed it with the sex spots as well recently and this is a really weird phenomenon at the moment where i think it's cam girl websites will create accounts or bot accounts on youtube and they'll have like a let's say very suggestive profile picture wearing not many clothes and they actually copy people's comments on youtube and post them and they're pretending to be real people and of course with a profile picture like that you might draw some attention and then their username is like whatsapp me or click on my profile for lifecams or whatever it is and again that kind of stuff could be linked to scams so yeah just watch out for that you've probably seen loads of it not just on my videos but other people's videos recently as well again i try and keep on top of it but sometimes it's just an army of bots and i can only do so much i've only got so much time in the day i've also gotta do admin work record videos edit videos write scripts reply to emails like the whole shebang so like i was saying i can't always keep on top of this so if you see that kind of stuff in my comments don't engage with it just ignore it the dumbest things that i've seen as well is sometimes the cow girl bots copy my comment because it's a top comment and then just paste it in but i've also seen occasions where the people pretending to be me or saying hey you've won something reply to a bar so it's literally a bop replying to a bot which i find hilarious and i'm sure that actually happens a lot more than we think on social media and this also spills over to my twitter account as well and i've noticed this in the last 18 months or so with the prevalence of warzone releasing sometimes people get banned and for whatever reason they will include me in a tweet where they're like oh my account's been banned i didn't cheat can you help me or i was falsely banned on battlefield can you help me that kind of thing first thing i can't help you it's got nothing to do with me second thing i noticed though is that when people do that they get replies from bot accounts on twitter and it's always the same kind of language where they say oh the same thing happened to my account dm this guy on instagram or dm this guy on twitter and they'll get your account back and i've seen this so many times and you go on those accounts and you can tell that they're boxed but there's someone at the beginning of that line who set the whole thing in motion and that's probably the person that you'll end up speaking to try and get your account back but you'll then give them information like your emails your passwords your personal details and then they will take that hack your emails hack your other accounts maybe you've got another cod account and then they'll take that and then they'll sell it on a cheating website and say hey we've got an account here that you can use to cheat on if you see stuff like that if your account gets banned i can't help you i'm sorry but whatever you do don't reply to these people who say oh this guy helped me out he got my account on banned same thing happened they're most likely just scamming you and the final thing that i wanted to talk about was twitter accounts and youtube accounts that might have a similar name to mine and i'm not going to throw anyone under the bus say i don't care what name you pick for your twitter account or your content creation channel go with whatever you want it doesn't matter to me but i've seen examples of people with similar usernames who will say something whatever that may be some recent examples they'll say something positive about a game and then people will attack them in the comments and say you're a shill whatever blah blah blah and then they will put jack at the end and they're actually attributing what these accounts are saying to me now i've got a very thick skin i've been on the internet pretty much all my life i've been a content creator for more than 10 years so i've read everything that you could possibly imagine in regards to me personally or the people that i collaborate with stuff that people present as fact and there's just no truth to it whatsoever i think that's something that you just have to accept as a condo career not everyone's going to like you people are going to make stuff up things that you say could be taken out of context but ultimately all i'm asking is that if you see a tweet or a comment on youtube from whatever account and they have a similar name to me or someone going oh jack said this was the best game ever or jack said there was no problems with this game hopefully if you watch my channel you'll know that i would never say something like that i always like to offer a balanced opinion of things all i'm asking is that you do some due diligence a bit of investigation look at the account click on it has it come from my verified twitter account has it come from my verified youtube account because those are the only forms of communication that i use publicly and if it hasn't come from any of those accounts and i haven't said it in one of my youtube videos it hasn't come from me and that's all i wanted to put this out there because everything that i've mentioned in this video could affect any of you watching this video right now it's not just about content creators but you've got to be careful you've got to look out for this stuff if you read something or see something online there's so much noise out there and there's a lot of people who will just try and take advantage of you don't just instantly respond to something that you've read take a second is it real is it a bot do your own research most importantly don't get scammed don't fall for it and that's all guys i know it's a bit of a different tone to this video than usual but i hope you enjoyed the gameplay in the background there was a couple of decent games i did have the live commentary say for them but just thought it would be an interesting backdrop for this type of video the hdr build and the a max build are exactly the same as the last time i did an hdr video so if you want to know what they were just go back and watch that with that said i hope you have a great weekend thank you for watching if you enjoyed the vid leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
