reflection without balloon as well let's get in there all right we've infiltrated the curtains what how do you do that that's a nice suit we made it to the lobby oh hi good day sir can i get a drink [Music] wow so this dude built the tallest building in the world there's going to be a celebration of death i could tell you that oh wow look at this it's quite nice looking game really that's one of the targets there that's marcus stuyvesant providence partner self-entitled and arrogant little woman yeah he's on the list look at this lady's outfit a thousand times that should be a crime you can do and if everything fails i might put you on the list as well lady you better watch out i need to find someone to disguise as and subdue them that guy there he's a technician i think he nearly saw me then okay i've got a chance here yep it's okay so do sir stop struggling this guy is a crew technician okay the disguise on quick yep they didn't see a thing gotta drag the body around that's that's who it is damn it you get in there i might have to go and fix this problem listen you didn't see nothing all right it was just my drunk friend right you're going in the basket as well come on lady there's no one dragging your body around it's fine no one is dragging anybody that just got a gun there's a crowbar here i'll die i told you about our lord and savior gordon freeman well i just confirmed half-life 3 and i've got a new disguise can these guys not see me it's a bit unusual isn't it yes love this energy trespassing i'm a i'm a god oh no i need to be in one of the black suits unless i can oh that was close shush now the other guys back there behind the wall quickly change the disguise and it's okay it's fine they're not very good with faces are they and that guy's not very good with coffee either by the looks of it i don't know if there's anywhere i could hide these bodies hey put that down give this guy a little night-night sleep time that's it just relax if he was facing the other way they might have been screwed drag this in here and drop that there i'm going to drag this in here down there oh i've got the penthouse key card a banana okay i'll take it will they suspect me if i'm walking around with a banana hold on hold on hold on oh no there was a witness to the banana crime we're gonna have to go loud here i can't have anyone any witnesses knowing the true identity of banana bad i think it's fine and we're up in the penthouse now so everything went better than expected maybe i should put the gun away all those bodies downstairs they're fine are they are these gonna be suss you didn't hear anything that just happened downstairs did you this is one of the targets here but there's way too many people around right now so i've got to figure out a way to split them up a bit we're coming here i can overflow the sink and i reckon this guy will be distracted something you get in the bath mate you haven't had a shower in weeks okay you get in there and i'm gonna disguise as one of these servants and that should give me a little bit more access i think so now i can do servant things like turning on hoovers and that woman will come and investigate there she is yeah it's just a hoover and i'm going to kill this guy get them out of the way where can i hide this guy i have to drag him in this other room oh no oh god i had to act decisively there that's my little collection of bodies here it's fine i'm going to do with the bed blend in just smoothing out the bed that's a normal thing to do isn't it no they found a body i'm gonna need a new disguise are you kidding me hey let go mister come here [Music] combat oh my god it's just a trail of destruction now i'm gonna put this guy's disguise on again i don't think i was busted with that one or maybe it was no it was that was when i murdered everyone with banana man i've got a new plan the stealthiness didn't work out for me so my plan is to get in the kitchen and disguise myself as the chef and it starts by throwing this battery at this dude's head [Laughter] oh my god okay if i turn the ice maker on it should bring the chef in here come on chef probably gonna see the body isn't it actually give me that uniform thank you i'm chef ramsay now all right we're going to make an idiot sandwich we'll get the bread get the idiot that's me put that on bit of seasoning magnifique bob's your uncle get a poison one i'm gonna have to go kill this guy [Music] oh no the other guy's waking up now can you just stay that'd be great okay right stay there okay i'm gonna signal the food's ready come and get the food although i'm a bit worried that no one's gonna come to get the food because i've i've murdered everyone oh dear not suspicious or anything with green toxic smoke coming off it no it's fine why are you coming that way for it's a mess in there i'm gonna find all the bodies uh that's kyle ingram go on take the food yeah that's it perfectly normal idiot sandwich made by yours julie don't worry about the green smoke or anything there we go do it do it it's done that's it yeah no he's not happy about that you should go see a doctor or something yeah he should so what now do i just have to wait ain't got time for that maybe i should change out of the chef's costume because i'll be still see me now look at this guy again although i think this guy he's already compromised but surely the chef is really dodgy now right i don't know i don't know what to do yeah i need to change it again oh i'm inspired give me that give me that ow hey it's fine yeah you know me here's the target you know i'm just going to show you boys will take ages anyway pull it to the face and do the job right i've got to go oh this is such a fail but at least we've got one of them so far give me that apple i'm the fruit ninja now we've tried bananas apple to the head is it out no apple's not as effective as a banana who would have thunk it the fruit ninja strikes again who's the lady here hey it's me i thought about what you said yeah i changed my mind it was an insane idea to start with what was an insane idea exploding golf balls i've never taken things to such an expensive dream before is this lady an assassin as well yes i promise i'll start attending i couldn't possibly have that sorry lady i'm the only assassin around here goodbye all right mate i want your uniform give me that i can be the maintenance guy now i'm felix from that disney pixar movie i don't remember the name of the big guy with the with the gorilla hands wreck-it ralph a hammer that's not reckless behavior there's nothing wrong with that at all it's perfectly acceptable isn't it all right i need to get back downstairs and get the last target marcus i'm just the maintenance guy quite clearly stop following me stop that you stop i don't think i've disguised as this guy before the waiter can be pretty incognito i think look at that nice golden waistcoat thing that's the second target there not to attract too much attention is that nolan north it sounds like nolan north i'm sure he voiced one of the npcs didn't he in the second game was in the first game it was one of them okay there's only one guard with him at the moment i need to be a guard you guys go in there just no command no command exhibition what are they all about brutal well hang on isn't that that lady from before with the awful pants supporting you i'm the fashion police and you're in trouble it doesn't suspect me at all it's fine i can just walk alongside him no biggie just gotta wait for a quiet moment here in the art exhibitions no one around and now it's as simple as the old one too there it is job done just like that now i've got to get to the exit and i don't think anyone will care about the bodies because they're just part of the art exhibition soon there will be no more it's modern arts what do you do with those blocks stop that here we are grab the parachute off we go a successful hitman mission from the worst hitman in the world ever i think my rating is going to be you might as well uninstall the game that's what it's gonna say to me isn't it let's have a look are these all the things that you can do oh my god there's so much why is there a rubber duck you can do so many different things wow uh my rating was melon man kind of like that to be honest better than i was expecting maybe the game respected the fact that i used an apple and a banana as weapons and it came to the conclusion that the next upgraded fruit to kill someone with would be the melon makes sense
