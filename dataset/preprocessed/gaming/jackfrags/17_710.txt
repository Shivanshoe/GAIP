hi everyone hope you're well and welcome to episode 5 of crazy things you can do in call of duty war zone for player squads was recently introduced to the game and there have been some mad clips posted on the cod warzone subreddit and on Twitter starting off with Kermit the Frog looking like they're in an action movie gets down and revived on the back of a truck and then throws a perfect c4 to take out the helicopter chasing them down now before I show you this next clip from Nemo I want to warn you that the Gulag will never be the same this is a serious big brain play from the opponent DJ sculpt so Nemo is moving to the back of the Gulag looking for the enemy spots them takes a shot hang on that wasn't the enemy that was a spray that the enemy put on the wall big brain 10,000 IQ play right there if you've got that spray please use it because as you can clearly see it works as a great distraction next up a rare clip from husband here so they're on the airfield I've been a bit of a fight here he's squad behind him they've been attacked from every angle yes but he is locked down he's got to run back and try and help his team out jumps over an RPG yeah that just happened runs into the hangar down Stu with the are 9 quick reload and then finishes off the last member of the squad through the wall now if we just watch that back again can we just appreciate I don't know if this was just lucky timing or maybe Hesburgh had a hunch because the guy at the start was firing RPGs at him but either way I've not seen anything like that before and it's just really impressive to watch next up a couple of plays that are so simple and after you see them you'll be thinking to yourself why have I never thought of this before so Jeremiah here is stuck in a building obviously he knows that there's an enemy behind him most of the window smashes it to make the bad guy things that he's jumped out and so he runs into chase completely unaware that he's just been bamboozled I've got to try that out for myself in a solo game because I think that could be all useful that and this is another really smart play from Sahara J so there's a squad on the roof and we all know that if you put a cluster or a precision strike inside a building it will hit the roof but my man here has actually set a trap but when the enemy came running down the stairs back into cover the first RPG and extra damage from the c4 gets it down the second RPG gets it down vicious for information with that RPG gets the armor break and rounds the corner for a tasty and for kill maybe something to think about in the future preparation is everything come to think of it there's actually quite a few really big brain plays in today's episode like chambers here they've just been either redeployed by a teammate or one daegu like and of course there they are that's that squad camping on top of the air traffic control tower now there are many ways that I could see chambers winning this with a pistol but luckily for him the enemy team left that helicopter there and this is one of the quickest squad wipes I've ever seen just devastating that squad will be so upset scratching their heads going sorry what just happened that's just brilliant from chambers love that palo de plastico though here demonstrating why his squad hasn't won a single round of warzone yet I told you not to mess with those load outs before but here's some Instant Karma force or berserk there was a c4 nice triple kill on the 4x4 his pilot flies straight into a tree and this is one of the weirdest gulag fights I've ever seen that does got to win this what are they doing did Y just shoot each other well apparently they came to some kind of melee only agreement fair play this clip from Javeed shows all of us how to successfully carry out a sneak attack so there with the Gulag and they've noticed this is full squad of three above them I didn't realize that you could climb the ladders this slowly I think this must be a controller only thing because it looks like really slow analog movements but he gets up the first ladder notices that they're still up down the heartbeat sensor and mauls over his options what's he gonna do let's take a look youdon't by the time he makes his way slowly to the top of the ladder none of them notice gets the first down gets the second gets the third they're all just squirming around on the floor out comes the ionised shotgun to finish the job picks up a load of cash hello dilute and now hopefully he can buy a squad back but that right there is Ultimate Ninja Warrior potential for sure five weeks into the game and by now we've all seen some brilliant RPG shots but I've never seen one that takes out three helicopters at once and kills four players high prices here I don't know what was going on it looked like those two helicopters at the back were attacking the one at the front maybe it was some kind of mating ritual I'm not sure regardless that is a perfectly timed and aimed RPG shot three helicopters one rocket four kills so impressive feat of endgame technical skill here from soulless there's eight players left in the game soulless already has eight kills himself and there are three teams remaining he knows that this three on the roof jumps up beautiful spray transfer let's take them all out they all start to self revive cool solace has got a big fifty round mag in his gun so important to take those large magazines in warzone stays on the roof peeks over downs one switches to the mp5 downs another this is absolutely crazy he's almost dead gets shot in the back continues to face consistent aim and gets the win that is an insane play from service right there and they definitely deserved that victory this is a blink and you miss it clip from Bad Psalm of reminding people not to shoot him as he's parachuting in completely hit that gets tagged by a sniper on the way down 180 midair zooms in and boom there it is that's got to be a one-in-a-million right there I think this one is quite rare - watch what happens to bogey here so it looks like the RPG travels through the windows of the Jeep and doesn't explode because it doesn't contact anything and you could say well maybe that was just lag or a book but it does kind of look like it goes through the windows so maybe that's possible this clips from rubik's is possibly the best accidental triple kill i've ever seen so they rock up to a bi station they're trying to get the guy that's there and rubik's misses the throw with the mine that's a really important detail though his squad mate kills the guy that was there and now pay attention to the mini-map attack Robo just happens to be nearby Drive square onto the accidental mind it was just thrown that's comedy gold right there looks like TAC rovers getting a bit of a bullying today as Sundance Kid shows us here why patience is a virtue so I think that that squad in the TAC Rover must have rocked to got out to get a contract or something Sundance puts that cheeky c4 on the back lies in wait bang triple kill love the little horn Edsel his mates to get in just to get instantly exploded Miska said that this was their first time they bought a self revive as you can see it's endgame the situation is looking pretty dire to be honest the others called a right underneath them Niska goes down followed by both of their teammates and they get finished up straightaway Niska though maybe there's a chance here they're in the really dark area could they pull it off stands up from the self res downs one bounce to the pressure is on here gets the third that was that first I'm using the self res I'm sure that it will be an absolute must pick up in the future I'm sure that most of you know that you can put a c4 or even a claymore on top of the remote UAV so one thing that people like to do is have their teammate deploy one and then you throw c4 on top have them fly it towards an enemy and then they turn you went to detonate but you don't always get a good view of the fireworks like this clip and milk are you I'm drawn right for this truck [Applause] I saw this one from salmon nerd and it's just too clean I had to put it in thermal scope on the sniper waits for the perfect moment collateral head camera takes out the team and takes out the heli I've seen a growing trend of helicopters being thrown at people as missiles and big doinks here uses this the maximum effect in endgame they've redeployed all they've got is a pistol a helicopter and a dream and they can't really see where the enemy are but you're gonna know roughly where they are right I mean look how small the zone is so they take their time wait for them to leave the building drop it boom there it is triple kill eliminates one team the last guy is self reviving in the gas and that is an easy finish and a great use of everything you have at your disposal and finally a clip from original George spectating their mate attempting to clutch it up in the end game and that's all for today folks the big thanks to anyone that put their clips upon the cod war zone subreddit and also on Twitter with that said if you enjoyed today's
