today i'm going to show you how the new marksman rifle in cod war zone is broken and super overpowered in its current state and how i want this to be fixed some people still believe that it isn't broken so hopefully this video will serve as unequivocal evidence so with season six they added two new guns so far the as val and the spr marksman rifle the as files got its own problems but the spr marksman rifle offers players the chance to have a hit scan sniper rifle and if you don't know hit scan in this sense means that the bullet fired from the gun moves so fast that it doesn't have travel time or bullet drop it's like an instantaneous laser so you pull the trigger and the shot goes exactly where you've aimed instantly at any distance up to what i reckon is 407 meters however you have to use the norma or the lapua mags to achieve this the standard 5 and 10 round mags look like they're working as intended and do indeed have bullet drop which can clearly be seen here by the visible tracer and also having to aim above the target to get a hit marker so i did some testing on my own here with my mates hads in the plunder game mode to start with using the lapua mag so hadz is on the roof here 401 meters away he's not moving i'm not moving and i put the crosshair right on the center of his head and click by the bullet instantly get the one hit kill headshot same again 400 meters crosshair right on the head click instantly dead so we can clearly see that there is no bullet drop with this lapua magazine but what about travel time let's test and here i asked hans to run from left to right again at 400 meters this is my first attempt at this i'm going to put the center of my crosshair at head height and click when his head runs into it instantly killed keep in mind that if this was any other sniper rifle or marksman rifle in the game this shot would miss 100 of the time because those other guns have bullet drop and travel time so by the time my shot reached hadz's location he would have moved forward past it and essentially dodged the bullet so let's repeat that again this was my second try same result it's not difficult an instant kill and if we go frame by frame that second shot there was only three frames at 60 frames a second from me clicking my mouse to fire to the bullet hitting heads in the head and killing him this is clearly a problem in a large scale battle royal game if i repeat the standing test with the hdr and the ax 50 you can see the difference aiming at the head both times and the bullet drops so it doesn't hit the head and it takes longer to get to the target too so the sbr with the norma or lapua mags makes every other sniper and marksman rifle in the game irrelevant and it doesn't seem to matter what other attachments that you put on it either so even with the shortest barrel and suppressor with those two magazines the bullet is still instant so you can buff this gun even further by building it for ads speed and still be firing hitscan bullets so i tested this a bit more and discovered that the bullet seems to disappear at around 407 meters it literally vanishes from existence and won't hit the target with the norma and lapua mags so don't bother shooting at targets further away than that however 400 meters is a pretty long range for warzone so anything below that you've got a really easy shot so i think that this needs to be fixed as quickly as possible being killed by this gun is not a pleasant experience because you don't hear the shot you've got zero time to react and it feels like you've been killed by a cheetah also with this being so simple to use and fibre moving targets at long distances away it completely removes the skill of sniping from the game it's not balanced and it should be addressed wrapping up though playing devil's advocate i think we've got to be fair let's imagine that this is intentional and raven and infinity ward want to have a hit scan rifle to 407 meters in warzone and this is a design choice that they've made if that's the case i completely disagree with it and i don't think it works well for warzone for me it lowers the skill ceiling and it negates every other sniper rifle in the game just to be clear though i don't think that that is the truth i don't think this is intentional i reckon it's bugged or an oversight and i'm guessing that this will be patched by the end of next week with that said let me know your thoughts about this down in the comments below hopefully this has proven to you now that it is hit scan with those mags but have you say below and as always a big thanks to all of these absolute legends for using my creator code in the cod store jackfrag is in all caps and if you do use it yourself to buy something tweet me a pic and i'll include you in a video like this one and that's all for today guys thank you for watching leave a like if you enjoyed the video a dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
