hi everyone and welcome to part two of my god of war walkthrough the first three and a half hours or so really impressed and i'm hoping that the game continues to deliver now i did try and stream part two last night but after about an hour and a half there was a big thunderstorm above my house and the house got hit all of the electrics went down the stream went off and the video didn't process properly so what i'm going to do is start from where i ended after part one and we're going to be playing for a few hours tonight and i'm really looking forward to this without said we're going to push forward we're in alfheim and we're looking to steal some light so we can get rid of the black smoke which is blocking our way up the mountain with that said we're going to continue through this small tunnel and see what's on the other side this should be good fun [Music] we're inside of course he's knocking around again not a big fan stop that big rage to start love that attack got him he recovered from that really quickly get out of here can i hold back ah the dodge yeah those things suck got him that was close good job boy now i believe we can line these up here can't we and get that chest like so nice thank you it's a gorgeous looking area this isn't it i mean the whole game all the different biomes very impressive and you've got these squiggly boys here which i really don't like sorry not ready you're getting kind of hairy is that an insult i don't know he actually gave the boy a compliment i'm impressed good night cool did i do okay show me more focus just can't give the boy a compliment [Laughter] one or two one or two whoa now that's impressive what does it say from darkness keep safe light didn't do a very good job did that no everything's ruined boy onward i'm not entirely sure what that does it's something important though i think it's so we can climb up here right boy let's go uh we do some jumping here i'm a bad boy let's go how would they do that look another light off what's he doing oh no he just wants to be whole again why are they killing him he didn't do anything do not assume you are seeing the end of a war boy you do not know what led to this moment but he didn't even defend himself that was his choice we make ours let him be whole at the ready oh i didn't even need to get that one don't like that here do you think they made a language for these dark owls he just bought stop spawning you i want you i like the way blocks right now that's cool i want to learn like a sprinting attack or something that'd be cool if you could do a leap attack like sprinted someone and then just suddenly hit them stupid dark elf come here it's brutal so good now the light is near look for a way inside look it up that did it look more light bridges follow me let's go boy careful of the dark owls oh the boy's long range he knows exactly what he's doing oh i got him on the rebound cool that's over [Applause] oh he's leaping into bowel with me as well i'm raising him well come [Music] my back brilliant [Music] yes [Music] just impales them with their own stick that's brilliant it is a ko isn't it ali khan it is a big ko cool good job boy high five high five no boy doesn't know what the high five is i'm afraid one day he will learn the ways of the high five maybe he wants a like a fist bump or something the dark elves speak what to see i don't know what that is you're restoring all the pathways i'm doing my best boy there's no health i can pick up nope on the edge again oh this one there cool medium-sized health oh yes the lineup [Music] remember this oh damn i missed that one and then there's two here three you ready boy squeeze on through let's get that light i don't think we're supposed to be in here quiet did you hear that stay alert and by my side hey when we make it to the light how do you think we get it into the by frost the witch said to step into it she did when she was ripped away from this realm oh i missed that you are more concerned with her safety than our goal i have him you're not born boom he's turning into a right little killer machine isn't he that was close do not stray from me boy you don't gotta tell me another one stay back the lights over there there when it falls be ready we will need to move quickly okay you ready kid right here we go jump boy look out here they come stay behind me and protect our flank yes sir we've got to keep pushing forward [Music] let's go boys we'll be fine just keep going there are many targets you will not miss many many targets superior numbers stay focused give me some help back let's go keep pushing made it let's go get the light oh that was messy that was so messy so much blood are you injured i'm fine wow it's beautiful the light it's making the whole temple reappear it's the source of all of it wait it's it's singing i hear i hear i told you i heard her do you think she's in there oh that really hurt i feel like my hand was on fire it burns stay here stay here only use it as a last resort you're giving me your axe i'm letting you hold my axe it's not a gift still [Music] she said don't go into the light but you went in crazy [Music] you have to come back you left me here alone atreus along with him [Music] now this is the homestead where we live from the start of the game he always leaves he's never here he doesn't want me he never will [Music] i'm not sure if this is the past the future is it a vision don't know homes over here i don't know him and he doesn't know me doesn't seem to want to i'm strong i'm smart i'm not what he thinks i am i know better that's thor doesn't talk to me doesn't teach me it should have been him do you hear me him not you well he's just his worst fears except i don't mean that you know i love him i just wish he was better i know he can so if he tries i'll try but if he doesn't please come back i know you're out there somewhere [Music] hey wait come back no no what have you done why did you do that i saved you you are trapped in there i waited and i waited but you wouldn't come out so i pulled you out boy i was gone only moments no you've been gone a long long time i didn't know what to do you left me here again why don't you care that's impossible we should go before they come back i hope you got what you needed boy's just been slaying everyone look at these bodies he's become very proficient but there's no light to make a bridge we're trapped and the witch's string is useless boy your bow you can give it power hold it up now we've got the light you've acquired light arrows shoot them at light crystals to infuse them cool nice little bow upgrade there on my mark loose your arrow into the stone it worked we can now make our way back come we can make all the bridges apart from jeff bridges he doesn't he's not allowed in this game i'm afraid it's a white crystal ahead just laying there maybe it'll help us get out of this stupid place i'm gonna grab this put it here hopefully we can get to that chest there there it is [Music] reduces all damage from dark elves attacks oh yeah i mean i'm fighting the dark elves aren't i so why wouldn't i want that was it for what was it for that one vitality brew nick a runic i'll take less damage from the elves now upgrade the boys bow [Music] the boy's open the bow and arrow is really useful that was a long way away cool right let's jump down i'm gonna get the crystal i'm gonna stick it in here see did i need to be up there yeah i think i did didn't i right yeah i've gotta chop through that stuff i think first i'll take this back give me some of that juice i knew there was a reason that you could go around here you can't quite hit it from there can you unless you can get it through now it's from that bridge isn't it over there yeah boy shoot the arrow when i tell you to don't leave me hanging i'm more bad guys you could probably use that to just throw it at people yeah you gotta get down on that one from here isn't it no i can't remember how we did this you can't quite see it anyway let's go oh yeah you make a bridge here there it is and then you look up [Music] just kill these guys beautiful i like the crystal if you find me an angle us make our way back up grumble he's so grumbly give it to me boy oh stop it they get smashed by the light i don't want to touch it i'm scared oh that was an accident bye right i just wasted that never mind come boy what do you mean [Music] [Music] it's so satisfying the combat it's very very good strike at the utgard frost damage okay although that one does so much damage i feel like i should keep that one for now i can upgrade some skills as well right let's do a haymaker let's get that bad boy why not read this do the thing boy do not want to read no maybe you can't read that yet over here i think it was the new mcdonald's menu i just might oh look the blue door that's not a door and a sand bowl what does this mean see remember the shape yeah i know remember [Music] all right so we've got to go up here to get rid of that think right here cool and there's a chest here we've got a room there one there and one there so you gotta do this really quick that's it maybe instead of if i want your opinion boy i will ask for it cool that's increased our maximum rage quite a lot actually it's like 20 25 something like that yo you're taking a break boy oh my watch let's get this crystal plop it down there light the fire boy you can reach the bowl now [Music] onward there's no way crazy fit through there not possible go ahead greatest man or tallest tree begins as any more than me yeah let's see stupid rails do it so it's a door after all it's always a door it's an impressive looking door i have to say and back physical beings again the dark elves are gone well kind of gone [Music] looks nice didn't it the one with the horns is back he just wants directions to the train station he will be back that's all it's all he ever wanted oh no the boat isn't here it's still back at the other side of the lake then we go back the way we came the lift massive area as i said in the first part they do scale so well do you see any other way no everything is big and it feels big please don't take that out of context we've got some collectibles here it's very dark down here a nice thank you there isn't a way back up from here you know i know stop being lippy with me boy stop it all right now i can barely see there's light make do [ __ ] you again [Applause] come back hey maker let's go oh okay well she's yep you'll help me if you would hold the light up that works use your ears adapt make a little bridge [Music] we need a a crystal for this don't we did i miss a crystal maybe i did he's a bit of a chunky lad doesn't it chunker let's say there's a crystal over here perhaps there's one hanging up there i make short work of these [Applause] cool so we've got our crystal now the spoils of war nothing to collect in that one what about this one that's the way back okay and you guys told me to smash the pots as well because you can get yellow and green plan on carrying the crystal everywhere if need be all right we're going to take this over here and do this puzzle there's a chest there too i'm gonna save that health in case i need it later i don't know how long they stick around for i assume just forever maybe if you go to a different area they despawn or something okay well right so we've got to match the symbols with the door so we've got b backwards three f and a tree give it a go there we go first time [Music] common chest armor [Music] basic offensive armor favoring runic yes i want that that's cool man check that out it's almost like alligator scales or something i like that smash the pop nothing in that one nevermind i'm taking this again boy don't judge me okay now where do we go from here we go forward boy can't go forward unless it's gonna make a bridge somewhere boy shoot i know yeah there we go has anyone ever counted the amount of times that kratos says boy in this game finally we can use the same sample that brought us down the first time i want to get out of here hmm i kind of feel sorry for all these light elves i don't know why they were imprisoned they were and who lit that fire as well that's what we all want to know i guess these are just here for detail that's stuck [Music] that's a chest stick that in there i can grab it thank you very much reduces all damage from dark owls by 12 i'm sure i've already got that don't i is it just giving me duplicates or something okay so we need to lower that down a bit further now and then freeze it so we can get back up like so there's an end there should take me off [Music] common wrist armor is that better it's giving me loads of runic but less strength i want stuff to bust my vitality to be honest right so let's move on here he is so him doing that attack actually stopped my attack oh he's shooting beams at me now gotta keep rolling away from those oh damn it he blocks that one very easily come on oh that's annoying i rolled into that one but that's actually made me blind which i'm not a big fan of all right luckily atreus can still see him even if you do a parry it doesn't really matter because every time that you parry it just drops the explosive things on the ground how can i not dodge that one that's okay we've got the stone resurrection stone a trailer can revive me wow he killed me that must have been really close well we'll get him this time pretty easy boss i think simple attacks i just didn't block enough at the end there see how quick you can do it i should have got that health as well it's just stood there i'll be glad when he's dead there's the blind again oh god nice i took the baby didn't i [Music] no none of you sir stop it okay [Music] don't grab that health he's gone sicko mode now let's get this it should be okay man how did i not see that coming need to roll out the way that one more it's silly [Applause] all right we got him on the ropes now can't hear him i can't see him here we go just die already no that can't be what did it say that we made a grave mistake [Music] wrath of the wolf a runic summoned someone's a special wolf but that is for the boy that looks really cool yeah can we help the wrong side all right let me guess you're gonna be smoking something you shouldn't get involved i don't know if we help the wrong side i don't even know which side the elves are on all i know is that the black smoke is an obstacle and we needed to come in here do you remember the answer boy read this boy what's that only time you want to talk to me is when you meet do you want to tell me something i said the only time you care to talk to me is when you need me to translate for you if mom was if your mother was still alive we would not be here at all petraeus forget it fight i'm sorry boy so pushing the light oh she was not there i like you even care if she was mind your tongue boy until our journey is over one of us must remain focused do not mistake my silence for lack of grief on how you wish leave me to my home i'm sorry i didn't realize no why would you you do not know my ways you will learn them i know it has not been easy how do you get as built as kratos in real life in the light i felt only moments pass if that is of some comfort to you that's good to know really so should we go back to midgard face the black breath what do you think there's more to see in this round six months a year if you just did it every day so what do you mean i see with the eyes of a child in war a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy the rest of him is lost sometimes never to return you know about war don't you wars are fought for two things survival or advantage battles maybe i see you've been busy observant i am known for my attention to detail there's an abandoned temple in midgard that a fellow dwarf converted to his personal storeroom packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms throughout the realms which ones did he go to what did he collect fafnir was a shall we say aggressive collector of magical artifacts the more he acquired the more he desired there was no realm too dangerous no relic too hazardous he once ventured deep into niflheim for a whetstone of all things huh i bet that was quite the whetstone does this story have a point yes it does i just happen to have an entry stone to fafnir storeroom you might find something useful in there neat thanks andrew you're very welcome oh and uh if you find that whetstone well it sure would be nice of you to bring it to me maybe i will maybe i won't i'm feeling i'd advise caution if you're heading to the storeroom last i was there all manner of nastiness had taken up residence won't your friend be upset if we steal all the stuff oh no no not at all he's dead i think oh sorry no no need to be sorry these things happen when one travels from realm to realm collecting priceless artifacts i like him he's the cheeky brother the other one's called brock isn't he where were you even carrying those i have a secret a super secret patch and i don't want to tell you anything about it hmm [Music] i'm gonna buy another resurrection stone just in case was there more let me think we're moving on i'll see you again syndry that even is your real name what is that another cipher piece i'll see what i can fit together oh cool so you guys are saying that i should go and buy a wrist armor i thought i had a wrist armor let's have a look poor fafnir there's a fine line between ambition and greed you know look at those bad boys oh ancients rubble damn don't i already have wrist armor on though see at the moment though guys i don't really want to spend much money because i feel like low-level stuff just isn't worth getting i don't know ready and ready hmm see that just ruins my runic doesn't it i'm gonna leave it for now guys sometimes the best purchase is the one we don't know father i have a confession tonight all those voices in my head well this wasn't the first time back when we met brock his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees that's why she didn't want to cross she told you he's been hearing voices for a long time we go back to the bifrost what now we have the light to midgard so pretty it's crazy to think that all the wrongs exist in the same space one on top of the other it's like this room lets us travel without moving we're traveling through time not space makes sense i love that effect so cool there it is and we met your brother wait not in that order did you let that seed salt put hand to your blade you do know he lost his talent right just jump and left him one day tried taking me down with him did he botch up on her girl quite the opposite hmm you're leaving a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again but you know what really counts and i got that coming out of all of my parts beautiful what did you do it's better it's adorable isn't it good now when you're done gawking i got a favor to ask what is it dwarf there's this alchemist on var been working out in the vellunder mines you haven't heard from him and maybe i don't know 100 winters or so probably dead but maybe you can find it he's dwarfing like me where's the fancy green ring owes me a favor you look if it is on our path oh i see how it is not a something for nothing type are you fine if you find don vary i'll make him whip you up something special this entry stone here oughta get you inside those mines thank you very much you give me the entry stone let's get to it go buy one of these that's a lot of defense there i'm sure you're winning smiles armor enough but why did jesus beautiful looking good now looking real good andrew jr what else oh wait look at that lots of defense but it takes my runic down a lot i'm just gonna get it because it looks cool it's got a socket as well cool can i upgrade anything here for the axe no he is a bit of a juggernaut now isn't it right so let's have a look dark elves just do that put that socket in there it's cool man it's so depth the uh armor system in this game you know when i started playing this i just didn't expect it to be at all we got looking good upgrade the axe as well close combat it's gotta be speaking around for grains of wisdom we're looking good look at this right onward let's get rid of this black smoke do you remember the way back to the black breath of course we need to walk across the bridge to the vane tower are we going to the black breath or exploring look we rode past that statue of thor earlier when we left the witches and what direction is that it's good [Music] morning that's a good start oh i feel powerful yes looking good i can't read these either they're different from the others customizable dad simulator i like that that's good it's very good can we not read that one i've already done that one i think yeah oh look the witch's magic is still covering those scorn poles saves us some time thank you witch i appreciate that yeah i remember this and we can drop down here i remember boy we are charging up that mountain it's there again every time poor fafnir there's a fine line between ambition and greed you know okay how about some walls of my own yeah there we go there we go one of these stop copying me son i know i'm the best dad around but i mean you don't have to copy everything that i do you got to become a man of your own one day let's go wonder what happened to those poor souls there oh you can cut them down oh no do you think i could carry here now no but i i said no okay boy no where's boy gone isn't boyz supposed to be on the elevator with me oh there he is he's hiding in plain sight so what do you think of the face in the mountain you would know better than i thanks now watch our step carelessness will only delay us it's very ominous isn't it that i don't like it there's a door there and this i don't see how you would get rid of that maybe i'll be able to come back to that a bit later on open it up well there's a black breath again what do we do now we see if the witch was right use the light let us finish this [Applause] yes the weird red thing up there the goal of this game or the story is just get to the top of the mountain [Applause] with your you know wife's assassinations the giants used to visit the military mountains disappeared yeah i guess they just up and left one day no one knows why perhaps they returned to their home tiodam maybe i wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important giants the mouth we made it more black breath matches the one on the door to your the giants did come here am i gonna have to fight some giants is that an idea i don't remember stories of a giant with a deer head wonder who he is yeah i don't what does it say i don't really want to fight that beast nor fearful thrall nor rooted tree that's no my call hmm the floor boy that doesn't mean anything something's missing i think there's a second light crystal around here i'm sure there is [Music] ain't got time for your shenanigans i ain't got time for it where did you come from [Music] from behind sat in a cave strange oh how do you think that god here we go nice explosion there love that oh this place must have been important to the giants i'm sure it was and this will complete okay and now he should be able to read it is it the answer freedom sure that works go ahead sure or else what you doing he's got an industrial laser in a 6 000 year old statue should i light it that helps right guess we have to go down and go up yeah these passages seem too small for giants why giants are just a race like elves and hold your phone it doesn't mean they're big what of the world servant okay in that case giant also meets with there's only one that's a giant snake use those to destroy the revenant please i'm sick of it those revenants just don't seem to care for rage at all but they just don't care they're just like whatever that's how you deal with them [Music] happened before that's weird [Music] messy there's another one i didn't even see you [Applause] i shot kid okay so we've got a chest there and we can jump up here to some runes as well and a big lad i wonder can you get that wolf to just go huge if you just keep upgrading it where are you going smashing him into things you're fine kid stop asking you're probably better at fighting than i am to be honest i can't even smash this part mate so don't worry you're doing fine that's really useful oh hey i didn't even see you there [Applause] delicious right i do want to get this rune been in there already that's made a nice little bridge are you going to come alive you're dead dead locked yeah what we got dnr i don't know if i have to do it in that order there's a n up there that's also an n so is there a b on this one no so that one's going to be the b i guess it's gonna be an awesome you're fine kid teamwork make a dream work right there's an awesome somewhere but i don't know where it is it's a quick way to get rid of those oh you can use this that's cool check that out oh is that where the r is yeah i guess that's it what did we get the purple boy cool that's more rage love that all right trace let's go follow me it was a small cave wasn't there somewhere yeah here everyone's dead this is a lot of bodies tell me what you see well they look like men not giants correct but you seeking treasure see the traps oh yeah lucky for us they set them all off be grateful these stay dead okay we're back at the deer now the statue we made it across the giant read it yes sir how's the chest oh this is new rock one of the four stags of the world tree he's supposed to watch the entrance to your nom while the giants sleep nope i think he's still there i do not know i don't want to fight it that'd be great could just not do that yeah oh we're on the other side of that red thing look at this i don't know what it is i don't i can't do anything with it just bounces off maybe i need a special axe or something to cut it down uh i really enjoy the heat just kicks him like whatever crawl through there the peak is still our goal we find a way up wow think mom knew this was the giants mountain no the request has been more complicated than she could have foreseen some more writing there name i think brazley it means terror terror in the caves oh no no candle all tangled up with string and some sort of animal hide some kind of lantern no wigs though that is of no use to us the bifrost lights our way [Music] why is there a giant set of pliers there what's that mine and if this claw reaches the summit our goal is near what's the point of that how do we use it all right this looks really complicated let's have a look around so we've got a contraption here i think i see how this works the claws on one side and if we get this unstuck oh i know i think the rope stuck under that rock that was careless yes sir sorry sir oh it's progress isn't it free the chain stop but maybe we can find our way up through there after you know getting rid of those things yes kid [Music] i don't like the sniper boys oh luckily they don't have much health so they're not a big problem really i don't know why some of them i just stood there what's the deal with that ah i was wondering who powered up every dragger in the mountain should have figured you had a way around the black breath all along now don't go thinking i could have gotten you past it you big sack of meat i got ways around most everything especially up here time was my folk had the run of this point improved the design of the yodnar traps and built workarounds to boot why you think they're so devious oh they remind me watch out for traps there's traps everywhere okay that's fine son you again i did mate thank you so i'm not looking forward to these traps whatever that means i don't want any of that business no no no no no no sorry so i can't upgrade the boy any further at the moment shield combat like maybe i should actually i can't resist i just love the axe too much [Music] oh a boomerang throw what what is that about double tap l1 to break an enemy's block right that is going to be really useful i didn't realize that was there press r1 after a last second block to counter the attack with a powerful shield strike see that's gonna also be really useful i'm not really that fussed about bare hand stuff i like the sound of this though [Music] okay nice little upgrade there let's jump up this that's underneath yeah i like the the sound of that shield parry so i can do a quick follow-up attack there nearly missed that again thank you very much more traps uh there's a tunnel but you won't fit okay okay of course i'm gonna die here i am definitely gonna die i got a creature that's cool oh i feel really really sad for it look at it all this loot here what's that about actually maybe i shouldn't have got that health i should have saved it i don't know i'm not so sure there sure is a lot to see here i think you can move it looks kind of heavy boy i've got this and we're stuck still attached i see that there let's go we're gonna just burst through that are we like it's no big deal mbd stop kratos you can put it you can put it down now kratos maybe there's a way through that big gate up there he loves it just can't stop moving can i not get across that huh yeah linus the animations are brilliant aren't they broken there's something special yank the chain it's working let me push that through more then you could help me boy how about paul from the other side or something next i don't have to leave i'm sure we can figure this out well that's the way out so i think maybe i went too far with this those weird red things again i must know what they are a summons a cast of spectral falcons that dive into the ground what yes is that cooler than wolves but the walls are more damaged so i'm going to leave that for now it's ruining years and years of history we've got a shortcut there that's cool that looks heavy might work for a god light work exhaustion maximum effort we did it i think we can make the rope wheel work now why give us the way to the top all right kratos seen deadpool a few times so now we go back to the the big wheel i think uh hey who are you i didn't agree to this yarn here sounds very swedish doesn't it oh god i don't like this [Music] oh that's new look at his eyes i almost got it then oh you taste that when you raw and you hit them in the face no no no no no jesus what is that shoot the big guy atreus not the little guy oh my god yep ow i'm on fire i hate that yeah that guy wasn't as tough as i thought he would be i did have the spot on rage though so back to the wheel that was cool i enjoyed that frozen flame oh i need that to upgrade the axe don't i that's cool heavy runic attack a river of knives that's cool leave it off for now isn't the dwarf around here somewhere brock is here somewhere right what's this as well look at this we'll need something to get through this one all right come back to that later well that's not going anywhere [Music] the machinery in here looks almost warm with the stonework that's definitely weird blue stuff [Music] what does it say yes sir that's funny oh so one hand wrote yo nar only and another road and also dwarves should we add to it no no fun allowed boy you should know that no i was going the right way i think i can't remember how we get back to that first bit i've not even looked at the map yet you don't get a like a detailed version of the inside of it it doesn't look like it [Music] hmm [Music] go back to the car maybe so i don't know what we're still doing it fits that's perfect perfect okay i'll take it [Music] foreign so where did that go there sure is a lot to see here it just took it away was i supposed to be on it or something just heated it into the sky right i definitely did something wrong there i think what we have to do is get it back and then stop the wheel and then get on top of it maybe hey wait for us where is the freeze for it though i don't see it right there that should hold it yeah that wasn't obvious really okay no we don't push it we get climate craters let's go all right get ready for the year boy here we go this is awesome i love this do you think this goes all the way to the top we will see you soon enough oh it's gone pitch black something feels strange up there we're heading into danger do not concern yourself with what might be focus on what is and be vigilant yes sir not the top one closer okay that's good progress wait that one's not

has and our home is no longer safe but it will be again and we must continue your training okay what about the bloke that turned up right at the start of the game i mean i think he'll have something to say about that kratos he seemed really interested we're almost at the summit nothing's going to stop us stay behind me you're having a laugh aren't you i mean right okay can you even dodge that i guess you have to dance the right way nope i gotta time that really well [Applause] what are you doing be that's a ready into it oh my god that was intense that's all you have to say boy i mean we just got a trap like attacked by a giant dragon right we almost died kid oh here we go whoa what was that red stuff so the dragon is that looks like a root of the ignore i can pick that up crystallized sap cool and there is power inside fine i got little grenades now cool incredible i can't believe we fought a dragon i was aiming for his eyes but i kept losing my footing do you think this is their home did they move in after the giants left or are they why the giants left boy the air grows thin here no more questions yes i see how do i learn this power i would like to be able to just summon those at will oh it's syndry sounds like someone's screaming how is it here i don't understand what's the game ever addressed [Applause] wait boy no no no no no no you kill something that big if we can catch it off balance i can distract him what are you doing we have to help him break right find an angle wait for my mark thank you so we are going to fight the dragon over here gotta try and get on it yeah [Applause] now this has got a war don't go inside it great that's what you're doing no okay right this is a proper business oh my god can i get this all right so he shoots things and electrocutes the floor then pulls me towards him right so i've gotta do something with this then obviously open your mouth oh god no that's not can i hit the belly baby [Applause] that's a massive gash in his head there bro bro bro bro bro i'm not i'm not cool with this there's more here i suppose you can block that [Music] [Applause] cool that's quite easy no just got to start here just ate me dude run away i don't know yeah i think you just have to run from that you eat that at him that's gotta hurt that's right in his face oh damn it i didn't realize i think i missed a few seconds of damage there oh he's come to the other side again go it's so massive i love the scale of it all right doing this thing again so we just run away i nearly got in the way of that one okay that does loads of damage if you get when he's doing that all right it's another stage here maybe let's go for atreus oh damn roof that's going to be like a load of damage it's not good he's doing his thing again no syria i didn't they wanted ahead of you give me the help give me the help why is siri talking to me siri i'm not interested oh god he's got mad is it he is it a she that's in the mouth all right here we go now drop it oh right in god side of the face [Music] donald wow we actually did it and you ah but but but nobody's killed a dragon for hundreds of years not since the grand calling of the worms and unless i'm mistaken you did all that for me you are mistaken the dragon was simply on our path nothing more you deny it all you want but you saved me and that deserves compensation what are these braided mistletoe arrows straighter than heimdall and perfectly weighted oh thanks oh okay hold on uh oh not that um have you seen my brother again yeah he said you lost your talent oh and that i'm selfish no i'm sure that i value a weapons look no over its purpose that i'm pretentious no and i'm tight fussy i know what he thinks but he can't hurt me any ah burn that i do not have time for this no no no no no wait wait wait wait wait i have a better idea what i just need a tooth from that dragon do it take it you better make me something good syndra oh never mind fire axe give me a fire axe a lining axe something oh oh the smell perfect that should do oh yeah i am not touching that just hold it out now run that along the string of your son's bow just humor me betray us your bow i'm gonna be able to destroy this red stuff now that'd be good ah gently now lightning bow shock arrows yeah whoa oh sure now you're impressed tris um shoot oh i see you've figured it out on your own then just never mind i wasn't just explaining the beautiful and complex artistry of my craft or anything no just anything to help you oh dear enjoy cutting trees you just cut trees with that right yeah i don't kill anyone or anything i promise superior resurrection stone that's new can i upgrade that again what shall it be who knew okay cool happy with that right now we did get some new skills there didn't we level four close combat switch stances oh i've got different stances now you're kidding [Music] you just pause momentarily okay expert combat all right [Music] cool that's a lot of nice upgrades there right syndry catch you later feels like it wasn't that long ago we were hunting deer now we fought dark elves trolls and ogres and a dragon i feel like we could be anything now though because we are determined disciplined not because we feel ourselves superior sure i know just it feels good to be strong you know i know it feels good to be strong look at this oh my god that's a lot of damage you know i've never been strong in real life i've just always been average one day i'll be strong i don't know when that time will come but it will is that explosive so that's a new trick that they've got i guess you need a different angle it's just making loud noises so we've got to use it in combination with this i guess sorry off we go i don't know why they're green it doesn't really make sense why they're green shouldn't they be red the arrows i mean [Applause] basically you've got to stop the nightmares getting inside them like that i think yeah you're better to beat these ones i'll find you oh totally didn't mean to do that wasted that might okay i like that you can stop it as well so you guys let me know about that hello what oh okay that's another new trick [Music] [Applause] put the axe away crazy okay those guys are a bit bigger they were trickier you gotta find a way to lower that bridge that has to be the way out of here hey i'm thinking about this for a second relax let's go up again i can't get to that at the moment pick this up bank that's right so i have to switch arrows here boy another one this one's called mother tried to tell me this one but i think i was too young are giants coming out of his armpits that's horrible why would giants be coming out the armpits i think that might be odin stabbing him no what's that what's what there's one rune in there that's where we came i don't see any more oh yes no now it's stuck on the other side of course it is tell me i will never get tired of shattering things with this yeah it's a phone kit isn't it yeah it's really fun we should switch shouldn't we for this huh it's getting colder we must be near the top not long now mom there's no way something's gonna stop us 100 already at the summit nah i don't buy it your quiver strap broke when we fought the dragon it's all right i can hold it stop look at this snow oh wow broken quiver will slow your draw pain we endure faulty weaponry we do not this will do for now good good go steady boy mind your footing prepare yourself this looks like it's going to be a good fight oh my god yes that's how you do it you just got blocked at the hurry hit that parry strike the lineup reminds me of assassin's creed valhalla played that a little bit they've got green goo what's the green view about i can hear someone talking in there climb up you hear those voices too right yes be silent that sounds like the same man who came to our house you said you killed it i see you've got company this time it's a stranger must be important if the sons of thor deem to grease me with her presents tell me you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy the tattooed man tracks show he now travels with a child where would they go next why would i know that you're the smartest man alive aren't you they're talking to the train all the dead ones too you help me i help you tell me where they are and i'll talk to odin your father won't let me go balder and he won't let you kill me you have nothing to offer me so take your questions take your threats take these two worthless wankers and piss off god so that guy's balder the stranger that came to the house as in boulder from boulder's gate you guys ever played that game great game some weird magic very topic of conversation a tattooed man traveling with a child boy took their path make sure we're all alone but we just saw them leave do as i say he doesn't know what you are and i would keep it that way who are you me i'm the greatest ambassador to thy gods the giants and all the creatures of the nine realms i know every corner of these lands every language spoken every war waged every deal struck they call me mimir smartest man alive and i have the answer to your every question why does the son of odin hunt us okay there are a few gaps in my knowledge odin's had me in prison here for it 109 winters jeez that's so i'm a clever lad i can piece it together promise just given time nobody there just like i said the boy's mother is dead she wished she wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all arounds oh then you've come to the wrong place little brother the highest peak in all the realms is not here in midgard it's in your name realm of the giants no that could not be what she meant take a look this is the last known bridge to youtube in all the realms see that mountain looks like a giant finger scrape in the sky that's the highest peak in all the realms no here can we just take that bridge we have a bifrost when the giants destroyed all other british to their realm they locked this one up with a secret rune if it still exists only a giant would know it and all of them left midgard a long time ago true but today the winds of fate have picked up a strange vortex of coincidence my there's only one person alive who can get you where you need to go and luckily for you my schedule's wide open he wants help we're going to yodenham right it's your best and only move from a tactical standpoint it's the one place the man who cannot be killed won't follow you what do we do yes first you need to cut off my head wait what odin made sure that no weapon not even thor's hammer could free my body for these bonds but fortunately you don't need my body the trick is we need to find someone who can reanimate my head using the old magic oh magic there's a witch of the woods she knows the old ways and she'll help she might do what a child but if she fails he will be dead he tortures me you know every day brother gordon himself sees it personally and believe me there is no end to his creativity every single day this this isn't living you're crazy oh i can't watch this [Music] brother in case you can't resurrect me there's something you need no boy the longer you wait to tell him his true nature the more damage you do he will resent you and you may lose him forever there's much about me i would not have him know so you value your privacy more than your son i'm going to cut off your head now good enough what what is going on got myself ahead we're going to una we're going to find the long-lost realm of the giants that's that's inconvenient yeah that's just what i was going to say hi i've just met you please cut off my head okay sure soon we'll be able to translate those moose behind runes do you remember the way to the witch's house yes the woods with the blood red leaves south of the lake i know just where to go i hope she made it back from alfieman can bring them here before you cut up before you cut off his head the journey so this is the fast travel i think look at this place this must be a branch of the world tree boy stay on the path right right i know i can't believe it was baldr that came to our house the acer go balder and you fought him and won yes one of odin's sons thor's brother and now he's hunting us with his nephews why is this happening if we can raise the head you can ask him okay raise the head you know it's silly but okay i secretly hope we find a giant somewhere in that mountain i guess they really did leave medway except for the surface maybe the last was gone are you the last of your kind too is that why you don't like to talk about my kind i mean your family before mother now where you came from mother a father hey this is time for that we're gonna talk about that so i think if we go through here we'll go back to brock's shop either brock how are you doing rock rock rock what i'm on a [ __ ] break don't hear me screeching at you whenever you're twiddling your shorts no pat well you already soiled my solitude so you may as well join me you're not hungry good it's not what i was offering saw your brother again congratulations and i'm sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again hmm there'll be no axe rod you're in a little tank i throat wouldn't know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chute i haven't known that word in about 20 years yes good all better now what the [ __ ] else you want huh sometimes he gets so wrapped up in his work center sense to sip us up and if he does remember good luck getting him to cook on me guess i got all the stomach in the family with the smarts you miss him what that spit mister what do you know i just mean do you mind trying to concentrate here already on a break from my brain already on a break from my break yeah check back soon all right mate see you later alligator boy what is the path back to the witch first we need to find a boat there's a boat right there boy why are there seagulls who god of war what's what's that about do you remember the way back to the witch from here that one behind the big statue of thor oh there's the world's up and he's still around maybe i'm seeing things i think we can go under and around here what else were you going to tell me about war wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory i'm gonna not make thor i don't know if that's a good idea thor wouldn't be too happy about that and go back and see the witch i'm really enjoying this guys i think it's very good the story is really interesting the combat is very engaging i like the characters it's funny dramatic just strikes the right tone for me you know ticking all the boxes i wish we could have gone on a trip like this with mother i'll try to do something here didn't she yes she fought beautifully beautifully huh the water dropped and the serpent rose right is that a little shortcut then i know she's really powerful but you really think the witch can bring a head back to life she seems competent in her craft and we have nothing to lose if she can't bring it back to life will it keep the head no but you may feed it to the fish okay feed the head to the fish oh man if only mimia knew and now the door's gone the witch's turtle must be standing up so how do we get back no turtle why did you have to do me like this i don't like you oh yeah i'm very thankful for those electric arrows we are done here what is that i bet this will lead out what's the curly blue thing hey this does more than decipher those mooseball hammerings it also contains the travel room hmm should we go visit the fire room around what the hell's that i don't even know what that is so this is up and out back into the witch's woods we'll go see here turn back asu yes the guys are welcome here see if she can resurrect miami's head there he is i hope he remembers us hey turtle what's up hey let me in look how colorful it is charlie is your witch friend here what is that name that's what you told me it was what it sounded like in my head anyway charlie you can't call it no no no it's a giant tortoise you can't call that charlie i love this area it's so colorful obviously i've just spent the last one two out two and a half hours in a dwarven cave so it's nice to come back with a bit of color put it like that ruined ready okay it's safe it's safe charlie charlie cool thank you for that i appreciate it which are you here she is here it's so good to see you again i knew you weren't dead hello can we trust her can you bring a head back to life can we trust it i don't know i'm not sure i understand what wait where did you get those the arrows give them to me now that you're a gift do what she says boy these arrows are dangerous they're wicked you find any more you destroy them understand no do you understand say it i understand if i see them i'll destroy them it's all i ask forgive me please take my arrows in their place i have no need for them anymore now what's this about ahead do you have any idea who this is did you kill him at his request he claimed you could revive him me are you sure you heard him right please do it for the boy take him to the table pamela it's been a long time since i've practiced the old magic hold him there let's have a look well thankfully his head hasn't decayed much and his brain is still intact nice clean cut cutting off his head of all people i sure hope you know what you're doing now hold his head under the water and don't let go i mean it that's some freaky stuff in this game man that's enough it works let me see him my mirror you there yes good oh what hello freya been a long time you look well what i did i did for them as far as i'm concerned death suits you better i'd bow if i could your majesty forgive me had i known the witch in the woods was freya herself i never would have suggested this freya the goddess freya you didn't know either sorry when word gets out that my mirror is free the wrath of odin won't be far behind you are god leader of the van near once yes but no longer you did not think it's important to tell me are you really going to lecture me about that we are leaving boy now you're welcome she's a goddess why did you do that we cannot trust her because she's a god everybody taught you nothing boy but she's helped us a lot she lied some people value the privacy best not to judge brother when i require your council head i will ask fair enough get me to tears temple in the lake of the nine and i'll get you to jottenheim as promised we know the temple what's there only the last living giant in midgard better to tell us the way the world serpent wait do you know how to talk to him indeed he speaks an obscure tongue more ancient even than these mountains none are left in midgard who speak it except of course for me you do that's true you wouldn't know it to look at him but yourman gander is a sparkling conversationalist i love the fact that i've just got a talking scottish head on my ass it's so silly but it works for some reason it just works in this game someone here i'm not questioning it why did freya spin your face no speaker balder he claims nothing harms him ah baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical the bursting of a god everyone has a weakness not him i'm afraid baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical you just said that vermeer did i what is the source of this power well as i recall it involved uh a spell parts of my brain must still be coming back to life just need a moment to finish waking up hope he's not broken he's a little broken i mean he is just a head that's a problem a big problem come here we're in the lake perfect darkest near the bridge jordan hein this is the area where the frame rate drops how do we speak to the circuit head there's a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge take me to it oh yeah i remember that that horn and we can use it now atreus what is that look at this it's an adorable little lizard a trace i'm sorry i didn't i didn't realize it would kill it i'm sorry he is a bit craig ferguson yeah isn't he good i put my lips to the horn [Music] snake [Music] stop eating everything gordon had that statue made in honor of thor and seeing as the world suffered absolutely abhors the fat dobber he was probably sick of looking at it but doesn't that hurt well he and thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them i guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet you want me to ask him no our only concern is your name all right wish me luck oh [Music] i'm still got it lads he remembers me [Music] oh he knows the pain of your loss he'll help you what is it nothing to be concerned about what is he doing making sure we're headed in the right direction listen closely now we need two things to get us into the land of the giants first we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to jottenheim second we need to carve that roon into the special gateway that one of the people we first met correct except the giants in their infinite wisdom saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate luckily i know where it is it's not far he looks kind of mad for a moment now that he thought i said you were friends of what would him don't forgive me never spoken the ancient tongue sober that was so cool that whole bit i love wait look the waters dropped even further you can see more of the realm towers and statues i haven't seen new places to explore along the shore where is this chisel find me a boat and we'll go from there it was like i bought me no problem so i guess he's just with me then for the rest of the game right i've just got head with me i like head so when we get to the boat we can either look for that special chisel now or go exploring for a little while i'm happy with whatever you want to do i decide boy which way to the chisel keep rolling towards the statues of the oarsmen then thread pass between them you're a flat dobber what does fat dubber even mean i don't know i like it though mirror you never did tell me why phrase spit in your face well she blames me in large matter for her present circumstances and not totally without reason it all goes back to the long war between the acl and vania prior to that wars for the acr were easily won but the vanier had proved their equal and exacted devastating damage both sides suffered tremendous losses and for many of us quite frankly war was simply no fun anymore but a rather senseless place for precious life enough no stories not while on foot our focus is the road completely understand taken from this unfinished you who walks among the living my beloved gulving calls to me she yearns for peace yet her remains lie in pieces i beg of you make my gulvig whole again you want us to collect your bones gross golfing sader magic knows no bounds she can reunite you with those you've lost really how boy i can smell your grief child rest assured her magic is strong enough to create bridges between life and death if only for a short while boy we are leaving it's a bear they've taken three of sweet ghouls exposed bit weird mate you wanna i'm just going there's a 7-eleven round here all right i guess i'll see you around good the special chisel is a hands past this gate enemies ahead oh no no no no no [Music] the head is helping me find out there's another head add that one to the belt i love the design of those trolls and they're so cool navi [Music] father maybe we should look for those bones why can't you hear him we could talk to mom again if we i will not be distracted by this fool's errand there's just there's a is it in and out i just really fancy burger so that's where i'm gonna get myself in and out i might see you later mate all right i might i might be back but don't uh don't wait around for me because it is a bit weird with the bones and everything so i don't know what is it i'm glad you asked actually i have just the story for you there was a giant once named a very giant giant who despite his mountainous size was without question the greatest stone mason this world had ever seen proud bamur hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge onto his son a young kareem through her at the heart of a warrior perhaps the father had too much fear in him for the sun too little either way the quarrel of the air spiraled out of control and the overworked stonemason bombed struck his son born into ran off into the night feeling shame and regret bamur chased after his son but in his emotional state soon found himself wandering midgard lost and alone sadly he caught the eye of the one person he didn't want to meet alone that night so far oh and chris hemsworth you'll see oh damn i know you fell in the village hi when family fell he crushed a charming place famed for worshiping the vineyard god bjorg always took credit for planning that one the truth is the sweaty ball bag just got lucky there was not such a good guy in this game he's definitely not part of the avengers wolverine a dangerous beast we will take him down together a wolverine hi felicia the [ __ ] of that ragdoll all right that's the first time that i've seen the game kind of glitch out there's another one oh boy don't sit down on the job what's this [Music] god i love the enemies in this game man it's so cool the tip of one yes a very very giant chisel that's a giant hand isn't it that didn't brother looks like that crystal's blooming again i move it yeah okay trace now blow the eyes was there something on this side yeah maybe that's the route that we have to take i kind of feel sorry for head in a lot of ways you know he's only got one eye he was tortured endlessly by odin not a great life although apparently he's the most knowledgeable man in the world so just have that going for him what happened to the survivors oh thamur was a frost giant when he died his final breath throws everything check this out man find the tip of that chisel that's the magic we need ow how are we going to do that i don't i don't understand oh they've already got the big claws out [Music] wow no i don't like that okay just to get this done quick i won't take any chances there wow the chest here we can take i did just use all of my rage [Music] hey finally that's a straight upgrade i like that lot upgrade the arrows [Music] just give all the upgrades to atreus [Music] race combo hunter killer isn't hunter killer like a drone in real life sure it is i've saved up a lot of xp what are you doing hmm hey how do the world treat that i don't know where that crate is didn't even see that one oh he's cold where's the crystal atres don't be cold okay the crystal there it is can you read it sir it was believed that yord calmed the winds and seas for the fishermen for that they loved and worshiped him here it's a little cray here yeah i didn't see where that ruined chest was a rare chest armor yeah that's quite another is that really yeah that's it's a nice upgrade again oh why did that just fall down it is a giant hand isn't it this is a giant i thought it was like a statue of a giant but no it's an actual giant it's a door killed that's so awesome i wonder how long it's been here oh it's called beard and everything family kind of feels sad for him how are we getting down there smash i have a plan do not act so surprised no offense brother i don't even think thor with mjolnir and hand could get through that much ice then thor is a fool this should be [Music] entertaining [Music] oh from behind i never really pay attention to the uh the things above their heads i'm find the butt you could like jump on him and ride him oh there's another ogre slap him up get him we can ride that one straight away oh we're just bullying them at this point oh you're not dead that was a lot of enemies imagine if we can revive this giant somehow wow that was uh something that the fight here catch well that was a waste of a perfectly how were you not seen there is nowhere here to hide oh that it's a little trick my people can pull a special way of not being seen i don't know whether to trust it can be invisible more like i can step into the realm between realms and your mind doesn't understand what it's seeing so it sees nothing at all that's how we avoid ever having to actually use the weapons we it craft it doesn't seem to work on dragons though your brother wanted to know if you're getting enough to eat i guess i could tell you what brock was asking about me was there mead on his breath you let him touch this again upgrade it more oh you can't take it out come on then so that's how brock was in the temple right after the water he stepped between realms okay now shush i need complete silence for this there you go he's a troll he's an absolute troll why are you trolling dog where shall we begin and for the youngsters excellent what shall it be need another frozen flame i think that's a keeper i love that we have a socket for that one now i hope nothing happens to the dwarfs i want them to be safe anything you need young sir heavy attacks do i actually want some of those but i need more resources oh man oh we're getting into gold armor now look at this damn daniel dab daniel look at this stuff and for you ah what more do you need right was there more to discuss actually yeah i want to sell something very well the business good also remember to breathe well that's something if i just can i buy that back i didn't mean to do that you don't need to make excuses to say hello he's such an idiot let's get started then is there any way to buy that back i wish it would tell you what's equipped ah isn't that neat such an idiot did it not tell me that it was equipped well don't buy anything on my account oh there i just ruined myself i think can you guess it knowing you it doesn't involve standing around here correct but how do we move forward boy carmel really liked jewelry didn't yes i happen to think he looks dashing you know for the snow-covered corpse so that one didn't have one on i did but i blew it up this one i think i've just got to shoot it enough times dude you better chill it wasn't equipped really oh yeah you're right it wasn't equipped we're fine i didn't i didn't ruin myself everything's okay i assume that i'm more of an idiot than i actually am how about that we're gonna go with that for now [Music] more skills for the boy we heading into that building yes you think there's something inside that'll help us break the ice and get to the chisel tip no i'll keep thinking keep thinking you're the brains of this operation boy after all so what is that [Music] is normally there's someone behind me as well keep it up [Music] leave boilers enter it thank you it's all about heavy attacks with those guys right yeah it was what do we do with that we will show it to the dwarves big smack and fries you got it come here you knew this place before i came here on a diplomatic mission once trying to broker a peaceful all the rock garden vanaheim that war so many lives lost what i didn't know was thor had already gone on a killing spree of giants nothing at all lad that's the tragedy of it they took no side in that madness but odin's paranoia is surpassed only by thor's lust for blood stop why does he he just loves pushing it further than it needs to be pushed just so pushy aren't you kratos stop stop he just can't help himself oh come on give it to me there we go oh we're stuck are we it's a big sword we go further again okay stop stop stop stop please he just loves it yes that's rather annoying you've got to get in exactly the right location come on boy have you ruined a good time yes i like the idea of that this is a dead end isn't it just for that chest i think we've got to go that way can't jump down there so how did we get through you simply walk around it's that simple and that's how games work i'm more chess no kratos you've been a naughty boy again you go down now you go across we're getting a bit uncharted 4 here aren't we i like this i tried four was great oh this is just as good though in my opinion having a lot of fun playing this game huh what now so i assume we have to climb that somehow we can't right now unless you disable it and then climb it [Music] i can swing it you got most of it one more well a stealthy planet is not now we must free the other strap we do that's very satisfying now we can climb it oh man why are we going up here we go with the scale again think well the chisel tip is under thick layers of ice so melting it won't work correct there weren't any shattered crystals nearby for me to shoot so that's not an option correct i just leave smashing the ice we need something ridiculously heavy to oh i get it the thing that we're climbing up can i teletrace to shoot that not from this location how are we going to turn the hammer so it lands near the chiselton not possible we cut it free write it down and figure out what comes next after so your plan involves a full box you are welcome to suggest a different one it's always luck what now hold tight get ready boy uh the plan seems ill-advised that didn't work it only fell a little ways find a way to the hammer's head but we're gonna go inside [Music] do it dad oh no the floors collapse there's a sand bowl but how do we get to it we cannot looks like a very intricate and confusing puzzle right i think guys we are going to leave it here for part two the game's phenomenal really enjoying it so far it's very good but
