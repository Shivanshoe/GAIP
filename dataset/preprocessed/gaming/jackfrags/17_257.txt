come on i didn't want it to be this chaotic it's sunday you know i'm chilling it's a bank holiday tomorrow in the uk i just wanted a nice relaxing game of bf5 and this is how it starts i haven't played it for a while god this map looks good doesn't it damn i mean i am all on all to say here vegetation ow no come on we can do it ah bit too high jeez that plane just ruined itself in the ground there i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'll do a slide away i think that's some kind of flame tank i'm not good at aiming today i can tell it's a sunday didn't sleep very well last night i'm out of rockets as well oh that ruby roll though hello brought to a head was that a challenge of some delineation i don't know i've just never really cared for the challenges in this game i don't play it regularly anymore but i mean when i did play this regularly when it was the new game and i was making a lot more content on it did i just challenges like what what even are they i just didn't care there's a lot of enemies on this d point where's my uh squad by the way there's one over there a full tank oh hello i think there's someone on top of the tank as well oh no i can hear it i can hear it stop stop running stop running there's literally someone running on top of the tank that's me dead yeah i thought it was looking away from me how are we doing six for one oh we're losing i mean i did come into this round mid match but can we claw it back i don't know losing pretty heavily right now i don't usually play on the japanese side on this level this little boat over here living the dream steamboat willie over here go for the flank on b i love that let's get it uh excuse me excuse me oh you're an enemy yeah that's uh hang on can we do can we do boat within a boat ah i want to do boat within a boat it won't move guys that's ruined oh that sounds awesome i put the bottle in the boat you know that's what i wanted what was that movie with the people where they attached the people to each other what was it called that was a weird movie man you know what i'm talking about i don't get demonetized i don't want to say it you know the one a bit i can't remember what it was called i saw it once and i was like what the hell did i just watch where they saw the they sold the mouths to yeah you know what i'm talking about i don't remember what it was called though let me know down in the comments below what a great comment i want this tank dead i've got three rockets oh look at this lad smash right now i've got two rockets a bit of dynamite i've got some ac grenades i reckon i can have this 27. come on mate come on you know you want it you know you want it 15 no where's it gone i can hear it guys we need to team up to kill it is it here yes look at this thumbnail oh i went the wrong way so you gotta always be thinking about these kind of things when you're a content creator what's a cool thumbnail like that guy hey let me on no no it's gone down it i like this map i mean it's pretty vehicle-centric but it's good laughing it yeah planes just flying into the ground there hey you come in the boat with me jump in let's go rubber dinghy rapids all right we'll go see lance you could have just swam with me uh that's not ideal [Music] oh that looked cool didn't it how do we set himself on fire has this guy never played the battlefield game before he just lost the destruction this man that i killed i'm twisting my neck around in real life like that looks really uncomfortable okay objective charlie's ass so jump on this he's reloaded a bit higher barely use these as well that's the one oh no that's jason bourne though isn't it [Music] yeah that's jason bourne there's no way i could take him out is that an enemy there someone's firing at me i think lad what are you doing lad what gun is that oh sick see i saw it was on fire i thought maybe i can get one little tick of damage on it and kill it we need a bit of squad cohesion here we need some orders come on we need to be an effective unit i'd love to go up there oh that's a nice view do you think the soldiers put sunscreen on because this is hot i mean it's pacific isn't it it's it's hot weather i can have a friend though on there [Music] veteran let's go prove to me you're a veteran of warfare i just hear someone screaming i feel like there's lots of enemies around there though pushing up to the back of d i suppose we could go to a the sound of these plays but like they nailed it with the sounds didn't they in this game i remember watching that little featurette they made where they actually recorded the real planes flying over them i'm dead that was a bad place to come out of the brush there killed by a bush wookie with the zh although squad mates you're gonna have to kill him first lads no no i mean i do it as well sometimes you know you've got to clear before you go for a res um but i wanted to go to that e point that looked like fun spawn at f instead what's going on here then interesting oh i'm squad lead now uh take care looks like we got a lot of friendlies here no one hiding there oh we got g oh i'm being sniped we're losing f a little bit i'm trying to get this tank first before i worry about that infantry over there thanks god thanks a lot and all the dad jokes come on sunday not even a dad someone else here isn't there can you get at that tower there's no ladder or anything is there it's a shame i mean it's very unlikely we'll make a comeback here some years ago i don't even know what i went to grab then yeah the americans are going to win this one it's fine did the us actually be the japanese army on the pacific island here i don't know i think they won at solomon islands is that right i'm really bad at history i didn't really pay attention in history class i'm sorry i could just google it and the tanks coming over look at that that awesome sherman there got some sick customization on that bad boy [Music] spawn here i'm gonna destroy it bang there it is i don't even know if i'll reach [Music] a bit too low let someone swim in there [Music] i'm sure i saw someone swim in there no yeah i did [Music] i'm not crazy well i am crazy but [Music] at least i'm not seeing things i think we'll play another round after this you know because it's quite a short one let's see if i can find another match on pacific storm what island is it based on what battle is this base i don't know again should have paid more attention to school are the storms only just kicking up as well it's a shame i really get to experience it oh round over hey that tank was going to wipe the floor with me there i think we'll play another round see how it goes all right well he switched to solomon island so i think we should play this as soon as i just mentioned it [Music] again i was working on like an entire video where i talked about the soundtrack to bf5 and how good it was but i lost the project file for it which is a shame i spent ages on that i don't know if i can be bothered to do it all again started from scratch it was a lot of work i was quite upset i've been really bad at deleting things that i need recently i have an unorganized pc [Music] yeah this is a cool map too so we'll stick on this one friendly knocking down the trees it's not crisis mate oh my god dude shouting at me so we go see if the predatory strikes here that leaf has got the green blood on it i must be in the central area here can you hop up there i don't know don't hit me then like they're all around us here i feel like i'm gonna get surrounded and shot in the back put some dyno right here don't throw it back at me gotta move out there eventually oh man i could get the katana yeah i'm doing it machine gun is it still there i mean if we hold out here we might be all right but oh i'm stuck nice they're gonna overwhelm us like the other team have done a much better job they're pushing ah monkey must die what a name oh they got the ruby roll as well that was an interesting start there trying to take that middle point bit of a fight on our hands i don't want to die i think they've just overwhelmed that point um this side maybe i don't like here this is real bad i think we should push the top i'll keep the attack order on stay we could try this way what are you guys doing there see the crocodile occasionally don't you oh this alligator how do you tell the difference is it the way they look okay i was gonna go that way but i feel like this is the smarter play yeah hopefully that doesn't see me if he does i'm screwed because i'm right after the wall try and get away from the wall around behind people here with that tank notice i mean it did now right surely they're wrapping that little sandbag there i don't want to attack that tank until i'm 100 sure i can kill it ah i've been chased ah survived a bit too long there didn't i i was the only one across the river there too yeah look at this japanese soldiers everywhere it hurts did we push and take c oh we did actually get c good so maybe my little excursion there helped and it was on the right side as well don't let the enemy close in on this objective i thought that that might be a bad idea apparently not getting in there tank we need our tanks to push up here or i need like a v1 or something but way more points required for that yeah don't stand out in the open when there's three people staring at you with guns bit of a stalemate here oh come on 90 damage i've got to get this kill i don't want to plank in here i think we may have gone already i can't hear anyone yeah they made it around there and they put a spoon beacon down i think there flashed up for a second on the minimap all this brush though you just feel like you're gonna run into someone don't you is that the only one i think that was the guy i was shooting at given up there i may have heard a footstep on my right then yeah no one say i think this will be an entire squad this will be tricky have a look here i can hear someone five hills oh this is real bad they're gonna spawn there they know where i'm at i don't know if there's a tank spawn here too okay so that's it but no come on lads i need some help someone get back here with me capping a as well hear them in that building one of my left as well yeah i'm so dead i just want a little bit help please trying to fight the war on my own no one's coming back here i think everyone's just uh waiting at sea let's have a look did they at least push well they did push to be fair i didn't realize that so while i was here on my own these guys were taking the rest of the map like fair play that flip is nasty though there's going to be people coming through here i think still want to take b back i mean they've got our gimme flag as well isn't ideal do you push in might be a bit risky this but i want to clear this there's more there though i spotted as well oh god one more did to get him nice job good job lads say a bit of teamwork make a dream work snoop dogg 2016. yeah you play all right charlie has been secured make it work oh did a cheeky little duck there i think maybe that threatening my head from being blown off i hate that thing where you get spotted after you've been shot by a sniper sucks have we cleared out the rat infestation here seems like it get him coming soon tm very funny guys they've taken b the weird how the maps just flip-flop like that hopefully 2042 fixes that with those territories yeah it should make a difference people actually stick at the flags a bit more you know rather than this ring around the rosary thing which is classic battlefield really well they've changed it now with the territories and the sectors so could make a big difference i get owned one i hate that character's voice they're called jack as well aren't they i've got the worst voice in the game nice artillery strike guy anyone on that gun one on the left there's one on the flag somewhere eyes over a there looking at me escape on this boat do a quick flank over here i don't think the tank saw me have a look here which was there no one there i mean this is well dodgy yeah i think i saw someone i've got your number mate although there's more there can't continue to push that now captain bird's eye is going to chase me through the cave stick my team good job lads i want to take this point i don't want to go to a we need to push him back look over there look over there all right okay someone hiding around over here i think enemy medic spotted oh no those are on the right two on the right three oh no they've got the bazooka i just didn't spot them at all and you guys put a smoke down maybe thank you appreciate you i got d that's the tank how much is the v1 41k yeah we're not gonna get it decent round though this had a lot of fun got the artillery maybe i shouldn't have put it there that's a strange name isn't it yeah my artillery there at least it's going to keep them back right they can't push up to that point now a couple of decent matches here i feel like the teams are quite evenly balanced too classic battlefield game i hate when that happens the game just goes no you're not allowed to spawn here sorry usually a tank camp in there as well on the left i don't see any that's our target capture the objective it's your target big cooldown on that too no way yeah great game though this was lots of fun enjoyed it a lot cool well there it is two little games there the pacific really was the best expansion i think i mean it was one of the only expansions for bf5 right and then they just stopped but i feel like they really started to nail what makes this game good and what it could have been that's a story for another day right thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one bye [Music] you
