if you have to take a guess what would you say is the most popular first-person shooter game on consoles right now well I think 99% would say call of duty modern warfare it just has to be but when it comes to some of the most popular shooters on PC at the moment there is a slightly different tale escape from tarkov has recently had a big push into the spotlight and a huge amount of players streamers and content creators have all jumped in and started to play the game and understand why it's growing in popularity and when I think about it I don't reckon the console market has a game like that at all if we look at some of the most popular hardcore shooters on PC how many of those are also on console one that is is Rainbow six siege but some that aren't squad hell let loose insurgency sandstorm escape from tarkov the list goes on and those are all really popular shooters on PC at the moment and they offer up very different experiences from your standard Call of Duty csgo or even something like Battlefield however most of these games are not yet on console there are plans in place for insurgency Sam storm to make its console debut as well and that's due to happen in the spring the main reason this topic came up in my mind though is because all of the talk of the next generation consoles we know that the PlayStation 5 in the Xbox series X are going to launch towards the end of this year October November I'd guess and with that brings a lot of opportunity for new games and if these specs and details of these consoles are to be believed then these next gen units are pretty powerful they're basically high-end pcs and that changes things a lot I will get onto the whole control scheme issue in a bit but I absolutely think the console market is missing out on some of those slower paced tactical shooters and I reckon the in next gen those type of games could be huge on console so games like Call of Duty well they're always going to be popular there's a certain player base there that will buy the game year one year no matter what it's an arcade shooter that you can jump into and out of really easily do you want to play for twenty minutes that's fine hop in get a few rounds in and then you can go to something else get on with your day games like that will always have a place low recoil easy to manage game mechanics and no real downside to being killed you respawn and away you go again of course fortnight's is one of the most popular games on console - and that does have an element of risk to it you die and you have to jump into another game but it's also a very fast paced arcade shooter on the other side of the spectrum though is a game like escape from tarkov it's gained huge popularity recently due to a number of reasons one of those is that the twitch drops were available for watching various streamers play the game but also because more streamers and content creators were playing the game and realizing that there was something enjoyable there and they were sticking around and I'm sure that more players were picking up the game for the first time - so tarkov is a extremely slow paced and methodical shooter you need to manage your inventory before you think about going into a game and that takes time and then when you're in a game make one mistake and you're dead all your gears gone apart from whatever you had in your gamma case or maybe you'll get something back from insurance it's punishing as hell and you die quickly you can take all sorts of damage from limbs bleeding and of course just out like death even the weapons themselves have all sorts of attachments that you need to consider as well as different ammo types there's different quests you can do there's player progression xp there's even a marketplace the bottom line though is that tarkov for me is a very satisfying game to play but there is a huge learning curve and that's the point and it makes those times when you succeed even more satisfying and for the most part you aren't just going to hop in for 20 minutes it's one of those games that you tend to sit down and play for hours it's more of an FPS MMO RPG hybrid in my opinion and it makes for a good watch as well for viewers because if you're watching it you know there's something at stake if it all goes wrong you don't just respawn without any negative effects other than pop G siege and hunt showdown on xbox I'd say that they're more realistic tactical games if you wanted to call them that consoles don't have anything like and I'd argue that paquimé becomes the closest in terms of recoil control and how quickly you can die but they are vastly different games and I've noticed that during the recent influx of viewers for talked of on streams and in YouTube comments many of them have been asking the question when is this coming out on console well of course I don't have an answer for that and maybe this game will never reach console there's no word on even if it's plant there would be a few hurdles to overcome though you would imagine in the past one of the biggest hurdles for this type of beautiful-looking tactical games was to get them to run well on a console well I don't think that will be an issue anymore with the next-gen hardware consoles are powerful machines and the next-gen are promising to push native 4k 60fps and even 8k although I'll believe it when I see it surely these sort of tactical games though could easily make that leap now yeah maybe they wouldn't run that very well or even look good on an Xbox one or ps4 but when you talk next-gen and you look at degeneration or leap in Hardware you start to believe that it could be true with something like hunch showdown it's already out on xbox and it's coming out on PlayStation 4 soon but there'd be nothing stopping Crytek who the developers of that game from doing a next-gen version of it - that runs better and looks better there'd be a massive player base there for it having said that I think we do have to consider a few things certain games like tarkov and even sandstorm to some degrees don't always run well on a high spec PC sandstorm has got better but both of those games do have a tendency to get poor performance quite consistently you just hope that on the next-gen consoles they will be able to at least maintain a solid 60 FPS but that would probably require a lot of coding and optimization the biggest issue I can see here though is what I'm sure a lot of people would have already been thinking about the controls if we stick with tarkoff for example it's a very control heavy game on PC you press B to switch between firing modes you press L to inspect your weapon press Alt + T to make your character take out the mag and estimate the remaining ammo the list goes on and on there's a ton of different controls and key bindings here this is a tactical shooter and as such even on a keyboard there are a lot of key binds how on earth do you translate over to a console well the first thing I would say is this controllers have definitely changed recently I'm not sure if they were first but scuff controllers were really popular before the Xbox elite controller was released the custom controllers offered extra panels at the back custom trigger stops all the things that we see in the Xbox elite controller of today I imagine when the next Xbox releases an elite controller of sorts will be normal and come bundled with the console itself even Sony have released an attachment for the current Dual Shock controller that adds extra panels at the back and presumably when the next gen PS 5 releases this will be built-in and standard much like with the elite this means that if those controllers do become the norm there are at least a few more buttons to play with when it comes to the PlayStation 4 it of course has a touchpad in the middle that to be honest doesn't really get used all that many games perhaps that could be something that could aid those games even with two extra buttons though or even four I do accept that there still might be a real issue here with functionality but I really believe that with some intelligent design it's possible and tarkoff for example it's not a very quick game so speed isn't really as important as accuracy when it comes to the inventory management most of that is done outside the game and even if you're in game and let's say you're looting someone or something you first got to examine every single item before you can see what it is that is not a quick process it isn't like pub G or Apex when you can just drag everything go over straightaway the other factor here is the consoles and certain games are nowadays offering of native mouse and keyboard support the latest Call of Duty I think is a brilliant example of that you can even do it with something like for us and if we think about it having that functionality solves most of the issues at play here and you have to assume that next gen will definitely keep pushing the mouse and keyboard angle essentially being mini PCs anyway that means that PlayStation and Xbox players could potentially enjoy their tactical shooter on a home console with a mouse and keyboard the problem is though I don't think it's the right move to completely rely on in theory a developer like battle state games they make starkov could port the game to console assuming people would be using a mouse keyboard but I'm not sure if that's feasible I imagine any game going on - if Xbox or Playstation has to have some elements of controller support because the majority of people will be using the controller and so they would absolutely have to come up with a smart control design without dumbing the game down easier said than done but perhaps the buttons on the back could act as a secondary function key so press a and you get one action or hold down one of the extra back buttons or paddles and you get a different result these developers are smart people and I'm sure that they could come up with some interesting concepts wrapping things up I think there's been a big influx recently in the popularity of slower paced tactical games especially on pc i believe that players enjoy the risk/reward of these games and for people who make content centered around those games the viewers enjoy the fact that your life matters more over the past few years there's definitely been a big push for battle royale games but I get the feeling that it's starting to slow down a bit games like hunt showdown and tarkoff have elements that players can relate to when it comes to battle royale trying to survive against a group of players in the round with them but they've got a very different twist in gameplay style when it comes to persistent loot inventory management RPG layers on top and so much more the only real experience I think that you can get on console right now like that is hunt showdown but I suspect over the next 12 months we are going to see a lot more tactical shooters making their way onto the new consoles and I really believe there's a huge audience waiting there the question is should the player base be split or should cross play make an appearance here I think that's a question that can only be answered by the developers themselves based on testing and knowledge from their communities cosplay is again something that we're starting to see more and more and if it's done correctly it can only enhance the player base and be a good thing providing you do it based on controller input I don't see it being a big problem if the games were out and you were using your controller on PlayStation you would be put against other people using a controller play with a mouse and keyboard and you're going to be put against people with the same gear I think it's a good way to ensure that you've got a solid player base across all of your platforms in closing I honestly see the biggest hurdle that developers would have to bypass would be the control schemes they would have to ensure that could use a controller if they choose to and with games like sandstorm that would be fine and maybe easy to do but with something like tarkov that's definitely going to require a lot of thoughts and work and I think it would only be possible on the newer controllers with more button functionality if you can cross that hurdle and I admit it's a big one I think you'll find the console market would flock to a game like tarkov there's a big market there for a slower-paced game and maybe the next generation of consoles with all their horsepower and hardware can actually make that a reality we will see but either way let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys you a console gamer would you like to see more tactical first-person shooters over there or are you content with games like siege and Call of Duty let me know either way and if you enjoyed today's video do leave a like thank you if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
