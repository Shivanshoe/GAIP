three two one go and smash it we do it in the latest battlefield 5 patch a secret skin was added to the game with no suggestion of how to unlock it apart from to complete a special assignment this is how the skin looks the eidolon at the time of creating this video only eight players in the world have managed to unlock this it was also discovered that an old unfinished easter egg was now accessible but to access the game mode with it in you have to enter dot dot dash on the menu of the game if you do this correctly you'll hear the battlefield theme and the challenge will appear on the right side of the combined arm screen you can enter this game mode with four people and it loads a custom version of the hamada map here you will find magical gnomes that show you the correct path to take dinosaurs scattered around and strange puzzles the only direction that you have is to move here which is an objective marker incredibly high up in the sky and if you scale certain towers on this map you will find bronze plates at the top and if each squad member stands on a plate the central one would allow the player there to build a floating staircase into the sky two people can also build a secondary staircase from this location while the other two continue to build the primary one the second staircase crumbles really fast though so you need two people but at the top you will find a pair of headphones that can be collected if you take these headphones over to the mcom station at the back tower you will hear a short morse code sequence in this case it was dot dot dot dash dot and this is an important code for successfully navigating a series of floating track platforms later on whilst the two people on the main staircase keep building upwards the stairs crumble behind them so in order to rejoin them and help you can fly up in a plane jump out and carefully parachute back onto the main staircase and now the journey can continue all the way up to 1581 meters along the way you will find 16 buildable ammo crates all of these must be constructed to complete the mission one of these crates can be found on the ground before you start building and you guessed it you need to finish with all four people at the top but when faced with the danger of the stairs crumbling behind you incoming v1 rockets fire traps disappearing platforms and barricades this whole process is more easier said than done time is always against you and with that said i'm now going to show you what happens at the top and some highlights of how our squad made it all the way up and completed the mission in total it took us around 34 hours of exploring learning practicing optimizing groups and communication to get there this is difficult if you attempt it you will fail and you need a lot of coordination patience and teamwork to complete it however if you do complete it the reward will be that special skin but like i said not many people will unlock the eidolon skin so it will be quite exclusive if you want to see a full guide and explanation head over to the battlefield easter egg discord at discord gg bfe a lot of their members contributed to solving this and creating the directions as you go of the tower if you find this video entertaining or useful do consider leaving a like and a comment thank you and let's see how our squad managed to do this in 51 minutes and 37 seconds enjoy that's right there's a floating death platform isn't it yeah that's stupid gnome some people hit it jump jump go as soon as it's finished left all built left what this is the really difficult one here i think i'm going to go down here we're going to go let's break it's messed up i think go go go jump now direction right right right right right you may get something i might go

shooting right fire okay fire do you go the right way i'm just building extra ways now which way left you want chew this shoot everyone shoot it yeah it's taking a lot more bullets up here yeah let's just get up to the top then let's just get up there we need to get up noises that's good that was good right shoot i can't see it because the clouds one on the left left right we're going to this one and then we're going to jump off to the right okay yeah i'll go first okay that's it that'll bait the v1 there he is you don't need to well we didn't have to that's actually different than before that's a different one that wasn't the same one is going on here there's an aquarium in the sky what the hell are you guys ready you ready yeah i'm ready full face in jack yeah muscle stop dot then it was dash which i think is that one and then another dot hey there it is all right just copy what i did then be aware the v ones that come up next you see what i mean the left-hand side of the bottom right brick what if that is the gap that we have to jump across and that hits us there oh i don't know okay right what if there's an invisible path there like in indiana jones who dares wins yes oh b1 v1 v1 okay where next i can see where the edge of the the cube is with the ap mine oh jack that's the way i'm gonna run up okay just go you're just gonna run and just go straight to the end yeah yeah yeah and hopefully it won't destroy the thing and if it doesn't then the quintin are we gonna try and shoot it we could try why not because since we comes in from the right left high you're not seeing
