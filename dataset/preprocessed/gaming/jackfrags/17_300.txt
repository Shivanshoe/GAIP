battlefield hardline in 2021 it's happening i barely remember anything about this game what's up m240b oh it's a battle picker damn oh you can give me ammo cool yeah this map is called what is it called derailed i think what's that guy got a thing on his head what does that mean there's people over here oh no taken out by the ro accept the revive yeah okay you're friendly you're friendly the grapple hook i mean that's the world's shortest grapple right there but that works doesn't it grab gravel hook bonus i swear there's like no recoil on the weapons as well you want to go street bike take me somewhere let's go this is crazy i've forgotten everything about this game oh that's an enemy this is what hardline's all about that's it take it out yeah there we go look at that reminds me of that hot wire game mode that it had and you can get the rocket launchers out of the boots of cars oh this is not a smooth ride let me tell you my camera is all sorts of shaky right now [Music] you want to take this one i'll take this capture point look at that big lad the chungo helicopter rep increase hold q for perk oh yeah right here i remember that can i well i can't use that grappling hook can i all right good job buddy this is uh a whirlwind right now for me guys it's it's a massive blast in the past i mean it's literally been a few years since i've played this more than a few years is that okay that's an enemy isn't it can we take that out i'll do my best that's it that's it keep chasing it keep chasing it come in front put me front yeah we disabled it there's no way mate you're not getting away hey hey hey give me your ride give me a ride give me a ride look at that yes is this a stinger i think it's a stinger right it locks onto does it lock onto everything no i need an air vehicle for it to lock onto damn it all right i'll put that down there for now let's go divorce oh man there's like there is no recall on the weapons well there is but it's kind of like very obvious what it is easy to control you can just kind of hold mouse one down as well just hose people oh dude he was just exploded i enjoy the fact that they've got the red hit marker for the headshots hey this gun's kind of satisfying to use suv he's yeah brilliant all right let's go guys don't know where we're going or why but we're going yes i got the roadkill all right in the front in the front front door big gate get him on the minigun bro get him i'm stuck it's fine we're on the point everything went better than expected we're capturing it fast deploy given by hacker oh no i kept running i was gonna pick up here mg36 okay okay okay i'm dead i'm so dead they were everywhere mx4 i'm sure that was called the xm4 in bf4 wasn't it it looks like it same silhouette anyway i love that there's people still playing this there was only like three servers that were active but they're keeping it alive i mean it's on uh ea play so you can play it on pc lots of people will still have it i guess might have bought it on steam on console i don't know what the like i just got wrecked i don't know what the player base is like on console but i'm guessing it's probably higher than pc because the xbox [Laughter] i just got gameplay there you can still find a game let's get revenge it's quite satisfying actually no everywhere oh they've got a gun on the back of that i'm gonna run out of ammo ah and get some hammer yeah look at that so try different class do some sniping scout elite i mean the stuff that i just didn't unlock isn't there awm what accessories just barely unlocked any canted flash hider suppressor um that's a camera isn't it stealth training i don't remember any of this i literally don't remember any of this but it's okay we've got a sniper now it's fine where are my snipes at oh they just kept going i feel like this zooms in way too much like a 20-ton scope or something shooting the leg the leg kill that feels cheap yeah there we go getting the arm on the go let's get some sniping need some more ammo oh no i missed good shots i see what you're doing trying to get the jump on me well that guy's gonna get a jump oh no oh ruined that guy's got a sick costume try mechanic for a bit what do i have a grenade launcher what was that that's that syndicate gun oh baby here we go this is what we spent ages unlocking back in this game oh it's nice nice bit of damage to it you know oh i'm good hip fire come this way mate let's go i've got a grenade launcher no i missed twice there's one behind me dead oh mate i don't think so tommy gun mp7 mp5sd aws what is that is that a harpoon gun like just it's all gone it's literally all gone i don't remember any of this what if i can do that put some c4 on the boy see if we can get a kill there's plenty of enemies at b what about the roadkill this thing's getting trash well i'm just killing myself it's something that i wanted to try i tried it it wasn't for me i'm much better on foot aren't i that's alright so shoot everything shoot everything that moves yeah mp7 let's go mp7 let's go you won't try that again no you won did we win we lost so i'll go with the scorpion for this map standard barrel can i

well oh yeah so we've got a we have to pick then we have to take it back to our bag or the vault we have to take it back to the vault are they pushing this okay yeah we did get a kill then excuse me excuse me i'd like to i'd like to move i was just blocked pain i had all that money on me as well oh god took him out that door what's that made of what's that door made out then okay give me the money hi outside curse of no revives that's a good name and then they just never have to revive anyone because they can't so it's not their fault let's see what they did there yeah they set up the narrative they made a good excuse good storyline are you okay with it well that's up to you look at the mini map there's actually people everywhere oh god [Music] oh night scorpion this oh he dropped loads of cash there's two there though ap trace around okay the enemy vaults over there so they're gonna be camping there aren't they all right got him so can i just go and raid their vault i think so yeah i'm just gonna that's mine now no biggie yeah i'm gonna steal all the cash hopefully they don't realize [Music] if my squad spawn on me that'd be ideal i don't know they've come and got me guys oh he's got a dead space emblem the whole place is on fire now i don't the cache has been burnt just forget about it it's fine are they on the roof or in here i think they're in here you're up on the roof they were just like sniping us the whole time you're friendly sorry this guy's not going i throw anywhere grenade down there i got rest they're all coming up this is a big opportunity here plenty of kills sorry dude okay mammoth gun is back yeah i literally can't i can't you have to equip a gas mask don't you guys i mean that's not your gas mask love that nice little clean up there oh i cannot stand this reticle by the way look at that how awful is that is that based off a real reticle you can't see a thing can i thanks i was expecting the door to just open but of course you know they haven't developed that for this game the worst record in the world oh my god just oh yeah the zip line do you have to you have to be at the right spot to use it can i go back the other way i don't know what are you used to there's an enemy there there's no one there eddie there's no it's not there i'm gonna put this small amount of cash in our vault and we'll talk that up as a win watch this watch fifty dollars invest i can buy jewel oozies for a hundred grand i mean why not i've gone for a shotgun again different one this time but the m870 the hell nice gonna go up here yes yes this shotgun's amazing i think we're gonna lose again though yeah we lost jj nevermind that's a bit of a throwback wasn't it now before we finish today i wanted to show you this because this feature here gun bench was added really late in the game's life cycle and at that point there weren't that many players actually still on the game but this is super cool and i don't think we've had anything like this still in a battlefield game since hardline and i do wonder if this kind of system will be coming back for 2042 but check this out so you access this on pc via battle log if you're on console you just go to the main menu and you can load it up when you click that it will actually launch a different version of the game and in this you had all sorts of customization that you could do on your gun so of course you've got all the usual stuff that you can do in game you can change the grips and muzzles all that stuff put accessories on but this had a really robust camo editor on it too and then once you were in here you could change different parts of the gun you could also edit the surface of the gun decide how bright or dull the finish was do you want it fresh or worn all that good stuff and then you could actually enter the gun range and mess around with this when you're here i'll change the crosshair on it as well put like a pink crosshair on it there's all sorts of little easter eggs in here too turn the lights off if you want and this also had character customization on it as well yeah in here so again you can change all the different colors here quite robust really in depth but you know not many people were still playing the game at this point and i just don't think it got used that much but the developers kept their promise they still did it they put it in the game so props to him for that pretty cool could even change the size of the reticle here too and look at all these different options it's nice bigger or smaller so there it is pretty fun to go back and play hardline i actually did look this up the last time that i played this or the last video that i posted which would have been the last time i played it really was march 2016 and it was a guide to how you unlock the syndicate gun so it's literally been five years in a couple months since i last played this and i've just forgotten so much about it my memory is bad as it is anyway so for me it was kind of like playing it again from scratch obviously i remember the basics but so many game design elements that you just forget about from these older battlefield games with that said let me know
