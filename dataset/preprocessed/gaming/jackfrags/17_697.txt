hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking a look at a brand new complicated Easter egg that's been discovered in Star Wars Battlefront 2 by the community the final update for the game went live today and with it came some new maps features and skins and one of the new additions was this resilient skin for gray but there's no indication of how to unlock this strange so let me show you how to do it and keep in mind that you have to do this online in co-op for it to properly work and give you the crate to unlock the skin doing your offline in single-player will not work so this is where the Easter egg hunt started on takodana maz's Castle there's actually some Arabic on the wall here this is the alphabet they use in Star Wars and that translates to the pirate is hiding something hmm interesting okay so if you played this map you'll know that inside the castle on the second floor here are some rooms and in one of those rooms is a painting of hondo ohnaka who is one of the most famous pirates in the galaxy this room here there he is looking fantastic if you shoot this painting a little token will drop out so go ahead and collect that and head back outside we're gonna run over the top of the castle jump down here and make our way over to slave 1 which is just chilling here in the woods looking cool with some tarp on the top so when we enter this area you should hear a sound now it sounds like a little coin dropping come round to the top here and you'll find 3 interactable buttons and the correct order to press these is left right and then middle and you'll hear a ding that signifies the next stage now if we take a look here some lights have turned on this one blinks five times this one blinks 0 and this one blinks once and it's a clue to the next step 5:01 what does that mean well it could be a reference to the 500 first Legion and on this map there was actually a 500 first Legion flag above the castle here just like in the movie all the flags there and there's Mars at the top this one here is for the 500 first so head inside the castle and then make your way back to the top and we're going to take a closer look at that flag and see if there's anything that we can do with it so it can be a little tricky to find but if you head over here and it's in between the purple and the orange one here you jump on the top and we're gonna just slowly make our way onto the flagpole turn around and there's an interactional button hit that and you'll hear a noise and that signifies that something has activated so then we go downstairs and this is the area in the force awakens where Ray heads downstairs and she goes to the room at the end and she finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in a box if you go to that door you can now interact with it and open it let's see what happens and there we go that has actually unlocked the skin for you if you do this online in co-op you'll now get a crate that you can open and that will give you that Rea skin and this is a cool little room there's all kinds of trinkets in here and that's the box with the lightsaber in but if you look down here this is just really cool this is actually a custom painting that's been done of the battlefront to developer team just a nice little Easter egg it's kind of sweet you know they'll be in the game forever in this little Easter egg room I definitely recognize a few faces there but that's it that's the easter egg I like the dice have continued this tradition of doing complicated Easter eggs but once you've done all that in an online co-op game you can then quit you don't have to wait till the end around or anything like that and then you should have an unopened crate here open that crate and that will get you that brand new skin for array which like I said at the start is located right here resilient thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed this one let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
