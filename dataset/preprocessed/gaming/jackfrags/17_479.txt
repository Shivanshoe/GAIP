hi everyone and welcome to hell let loose today i thought that i would fire up a hell let loose livestream i know you guys like to watch that game and we're going to be playing with the usual crew tommy bong and we'll also be joined by johnny and freeman but it's a bit different today because nvidia have sponsored this stream this video content and we're going to be playing the game on g-force now and this will be an interesting test of it for me because the previous stream that we did on geforce now i was playing assassin's creed valhalla which is a single player game but i thought that for today we'd try out a competitive multiplayer game and really see what it was like so we're going to be playing hell let loose today on geforce now i'm looking forward to it hell let loose is always good fun and lots of you have requested that i streamed this in the past so that's what we're going to be doing you can play all sorts of other games on here like cyberpunk with ray tracing on dlss all those cool nvidia features and the way this works is that you're essentially streaming the game from a server to your device so this won't be running natively on my pc i'll be playing a video stream of the game which is running on a pc somewhere in europe which is crazy so the whole point of this is if you've got an old laptop or a device that can't really run these type of games if you use geforce now you can still have a crack at it and play it and see what you think and if you're interested in checking out for yourself the basic version of it is free and there's a link down in the description below so all we've got to do really here is just click play and it should load up there's a few people in the queue so we might have to wait a little bit i know it's been quite popular at the moment i should just load up the game here remember this is not being played on my pc it's logging into my steam account i've already logged in there there we go crazy cloud gaming 2020 i always thought that this wouldn't be a popular thing you know cloud gaming but a lot of people use this stuff obviously if you can afford a a decent pc or whatever um it's a bit different but if you're gaming on the go or whatever it's really useful you go so this is being streamed to my computer right now hey tio what's up nuclear fish dk it's hell let loose coming to console findi i don't know but it should do shouldn't it you think it should be on the next gen consoles so has this got my controls and stuff my video settings 1080p 60fps that's the video stream all right let's see if they've got the the boys are ready to play hello oh hey sorry put me in a little cue there did it jack i'm good to go now though okay that's good 23. number one yeah uh 7700 on hurricane forest it says for me you're on that one yeah yeah yeah oh straight into that one i mean obviously we're not going to be communicating in german unless you've all been doing your listings do you guys i'm in the americas america americas americas are you going to take easy squad yeah yeah oh i've not even joined you guys loaded in faster than me okay i mean george squad no [ __ ] squad it's easy oh easy companies yeah tv show isn't it yeah yeah easy companies band of brothers well there it is i'll play support so we're the band of brothers is that what you're saying we are abandoned i wouldn't say it as brazenly as you just said okay now this actually is a good machine um shall i go are there tanks on this map there aren't yeah all right we're getting a little truck or anything i think we should get a truck yeah it's all on squad leader freeman's shoulders i know i think it's already hoofed away look it's the transport yeah yeah work it up uh the scar is a fierce battlefield right i want us to go here i haven't got an engineer which is sad but that's all right are you squad leader adam um medic i don't know you just get like a little thing out and soon them don't you oh okay that's interesting uh further along towards scala or something like uh d6 something like that let's have a look at the map i mean this i don't know if we'll have room there but we try here right there johnny it has to be 200 meters away from the next garrison to put one up so johnny want you you do a full square and a bit away there was a man you wanted some meds so i'll try that to give him some i mean you just stopped in the field so you know like clarity tiaa might be what i need to do on gfn because that's quite good for um my mouse sense is absolutely mad yeah mine was um it didn't have the same mouse as my steam profile yeah okay that's fine i was wondering what's going on oh and my fov that's why i was like okay and goes for bear bitter a large beer please what is it um landlocked pirate holy cow thank you so much man merry christmas keep the memes alive unlocked the memes are always alive my friend always yeah so this is obviously it doesn't look as good as natively playing the game you can see the the some artifacting is this this is a video stream so what you're watching here is a stream within a stream it's stream ception right now but in terms of input lag it's very low for an fps game you know it's not bad i mean you can feel it a little bit i have to be honest with you guys it there's a tiny bit of a delay but i reckon i'm still going to be able to be competitive with this the only thing with this game is that because it's a more realistic shooter people are going to be blending in and i might not notice someone at distance because you know some of the artifacts in with the video stream but i could be playing this on a 10 year old laptop right now that's the point of this let's see what the boys are up to what's the plan for the south we're going south my sensitivity was and it's uh stressing me out i'm going to do 20 minus 15 now i'm going to get 20 i think yeah i'll do that's better some noble eggs here there's always a nobel laureate snowboard eggs pack good up here come on could we not get it was there no transport vehicles available no there was nothing you could spawn jack on the on the that's right i mean i'm right behind johnny i mean i think i might as well just read it yeah nuclear fish it skips every now and again but i think it's loading in the map and i can i have a one gigabit connection so it should be able to download all the things like quick enough but it does like it skips every now and again but like i said this will be an interesting test of this and i'm going to be honest with you guys uh it is sponsored but you know it's all about can you be competitive i mean you can play games like counter strike on this and apex i'm going to catch a bullet in the head here aren't i jack frags oh god that dudes just found me straight away yeah i appreciate everyone's due to the role i can't help with that can i what uh that thing that todd grimm is hammering there uh not unless you've got a hammer no it's quite it's quite difficult a distance to see people time i think with this because it's quite a artifacting map isn't it yeah yeah good luck we'll have to get up close and do some flanks i put it on medium as well or maybe go in a tank or something go do some sniping i think uh let's see i'm getting mine's getting anything else mine's like stopping and starting it's not like yeah there's a bit of hitching every now and again yeah it's hitching you don't have to get that on this so i'm not knowing what that's causing that could be the game i could put some supplies down on this bridge tell me uh where are you guys i'm machine gunner so you know uh i thought yeah ng oh you've gone all the way south [Music] i was doing my settings and stuff if you put a squad thing down and we'll just respawn on it there's the garrison right at the bottom very close to us would it be quicker to redeploy then uh in fact we don't mind there is a squad sport next to ruin and it's being i'm redeploying okay read a boy then it doesn't feel intentional hey sp what's up insert name i see gonna try venice unleashed maybe mars boy yeah maybe what's up kieran how are you doing it sounds realistic yeah it does doesn't it and there's the garrison so we should be able to spawn there in three seconds you know when you can't be revved uh i'm at the garrison now it's right in front of me jack the tanks right in front of you can you ping it just give it a little ping whoa two tanks there's two tanks i'm thinking yeah they're firing out i can't confirm there are two tanks that ruin me instantly killed after two james jackson i'm gonna play engineer then i know we've got ng all right be flanking up here i've got a big redeploy time there what the hell we have a little squad spawner that'll be lovely yeah bong can you put one on adam could you please um yeah thank you yes is that johnny that ping is that where the tank is one's dead yeah well i think it broke that night all right who killed him that was the second one uh it might have been our fan or something yeah yeah i said watch these weasels weaseling in he's a portuguese weasel commander oh there's another tank there yeah he ever thought peter unhappy about that what would that what they're not happy that the commander yeah why but they wanted german i was just a german only server well sorry we won wow uh where are we going commander we need to move marker dismantling know gas and hang on nice i've destroyed i've just captured the scar fuel node as well i don't see anything moving up there yeah you're mg tom yeah you put the garrison down on that mark near me i can hear a time yeah i marked them oh you're the answer sounds right is that a tanker is that a plane i'm not sure i'll tell no it's superman super superman fine all right let's just get forward here john yeah okay just drop supplies over here look um are there artillery cannons over here no it's right on the other side of the map the artillery is only in the spawns yeah there's an enemy supply drop coming in uh between 10 to 15 degrees oh my god why are we not all following come on across the river is that the artillery garage i think we should just start sweeping north shouldn't we yeah i mean i can't see anyone over there this is uh it's gonna be a tough physically tall order but to get in like you say it might be hurting uh certainly is exacerbating the uh oh hello that's enemy close isn't it yeah yeah in the trench i don't see him tom there's one on the left all right we're in that trench maybe oh marked a couple three in that trench there's some dead german soldiers here they've cleared them we've cleared the cave i didn't fire a single shot g6 yeah like a g6 follow commander freeman's orders to the letter are they up on that hill god command has been taken down i've got one grenade going on my body i think that grenade's going to miss us we should be all right that's what we'd like to see although it has pulped free man i'll certainly need bandaging as well yeah freeman's now merely a bloody stump for the floor butter yeah i might have to mute some people just in case sorry um i got revived sadly i was revived inside the geometries uh is it voice volume yeah what's the default keyboard for voice i don't know actually can you give us a new uh i don't know v c and x is the course he's local c squadron x is commander look at tally ho biggles what's he doing up there well this is actually quite a good push but uh we're all pushing along one big line here yeah it's good sweeping just means that there's no no one's going to get through i mean this is clear right up here should be cause we're kind of yeah well i'm following adam's move marker it's the e movement when you press t johnny patrice this is the m1 garand or garen does some people pronounce it i don't know what the correct pronunciation is what's up surgery hello drakoshi heck how's it going guys hello mark juan all right jake nice to chat to you bf5 looks weird yeah so hell let loose let's create a new galaxy but every building i can't help can i with this wrench what do you need you can help your hammer no the rent is building a pack gun jack yeah well we haven't really got a good place for that haven't we i think there's build marks that dick's put on the squad uh top room 100 supplies for a package in the north garrison do you need some stuff building there's a guy called elvis to press leader very nice uh well the only point we've got to turn now is hill 15 and then on to the grocery bill they'll be all over hill 15. i can tell you that yeah they'll probably be tanks behind it up to that outpost there that's probably clear okay exactly is jack the second in command as he's followed with i'll follow your orders freeman was engaged in chatter and uh what would the commanding of commander for strategizing yeah trying to win you the bloody war getting home in time for tea home in time for tea home inside for tea the new hot track out this christmas uh where we mean what's on this hill here yeah i'm just just behind bars well we'll attack hill 15 from the south you're about to get about to get a recon plane so you can tell us where they are god leaders when's the recon plane coming i hate enemy shots like 140. i'm getting into this um i'm getting yeah there's a tank on our right somewhere he's over over here yeah i've got 80. you sniff him out gotta get behind him is that the artillery firing it might be artillery yeah yeah you know what we're actually pretty close to there let's go get the rt keep your heads down yeah wesley it's a bit choppy it's not your internet it's just uh how the game is uh it's been streamed it's so loud but it's actually still quite far away oh it's artillery isn't it do we have any smoke grenades a train track artillery the rail guns i can certainly hear the artillery i can't see it this artillery on the right is all somewhere i think that was a tank it was these are rts would you rather go for the tank well we should kill these and then thank you desert fox that's very kindly fear of jimmy i mean it's so loud okay the tank's in front of freeman oh no we're losing the scar and they're just behind this building here yeah i see the smoke it's funny this is the way to clean up oh yeah you reckon they've uh well they won't know that we're coming will they yeah this is good this is a full duck shoot they'll just spawn here again there oh my god it shakes your screen [Music] we got two of them straight away how did they know we were there oh there's another one there snaking around oh no you get him something got me with a stray i'm gonna go back into the phone got him he's dead he's dead he's dead and we cleared their artillery that was cool but i mean oh quit rude is that youtube no no i want your there's enough people back what's that um i'm going to respawn on you guys is there an enemy tank there i can hear it there's an enemy tank yeah yeah here right jack where are you i'm spawning in 15 seconds wow wow wow right here is he facing that outpost no no he's okay he's okay we need a white in a way he is yeah oh my god did you get shot then johnny no i just [ __ ] where'd you want me son i've smoked i'm gonna distract him yeah i'll distract him you can keep smoking him that'll work because if he sees us running out of the trunk oh my god jack come with me over here jack shouldn't come with us attention right yeah but i need to get behind it behind him yeah we've got the hill nice keep your head down keep your head down this way we're going to go all the way around look where's how do you get around the bottom player here we go i'm round mark's here they'll never see a serger i don't think we stand out earlier here we're moving retreating there is trance tracks slowly trundling is he retreating yeah yeah you need to get an ass shot though yeah have you got explosive ammo tom no you're gonna i'm just i'm just oh yeah the turret he didn't seem to care at all he's just instantly returned fire out there look we're beating him off whilst our team get gross approach i'm gonna peek and take another shot yeah i'm gonna try and i killed a friend it's all right i was kind of distracted you know did i get it no no it's still it's still going uh he's been pulled over i don't see anyone tom yeah he was running up behind you i saw a guy uh where he was like here here is maybe there might be prone now at tanks right in front of me yeah yeah he was he was running up behind you like i might have hit fired him i don't know i don't see any bodies jackson's making you aware that there's always you know enemies in the mouth oh they're back on the rt the arty we don't go ruin them again yeah there's a there's people like chrome and grenades i think let's just go to grusar approach yeah let's take the point could go and ruin those artillery people again we'll be really annoyed at that surely you don't really need one person to see that enemy enemy tank's going to just be careful because he came from there to our right they might have an angle on you yeah he can't really do anything down there i suppose if you fired a fantastic actually down the barrel apparently we're losing hill 15. i'm gonna go back oh no no no but look at look at the amount of people we've got on the gross house yeah doesn't matter it's the same experience we need to at least hamper their i'm just going to not look back and keep running i think he knows oh no no no we must said we must oh no no no he wants revenge for those two rockets that i put in his mouth please we're downhill we're downhill it's fine just keep keep running tom go i can't run he's firing at me there's a tank touching me it's touching me [Applause] it's absolutely second tank coming up from the south okay okay come on shoot me [Applause] how did you survive that long that's so stupid yeah there's definitely a few micro stutters every now and again i'm sure you guys can see that as well i wish that i could play it at a higher bit rate too because the maximum at the moment is 50 and i could definitely stream more than oh my god artillery we could definitely stream more than that with my connection oh i'll tell you we got me holding in the front of the hole that you should wow yeah yeah i just got mad inside i wish you could do stuff like that on this i just got murdered by artillery at least i have some ammo now i think you're about to win i think that's the easiest game we've ever done yeah and there's the enemy tank again i'll give it a bit more hey did you yes we're not we weren't on the smooths unbelievable since also i did an excellent job oh i got five kills i got no one and i'm here i think i saw five enemies and the yanks are coming my massive beer i am a beer i am a giant beer hold my beer [Music] good job this music's royalty-free [Music] i mean this is just chaos right now yeah but next match sorry that was an easy one it's the easiest game it was pretty easy that's right i like the role of everything the music slaps apparently does this slap this music is that what the kid said oh yeah might play assault actually assault has smoked oh now it's time to snow and die churchill didn't write that song i think it's an american song isn't it i don't think churchill wrote any songs yeah he did he wrote mag beer is i like beer all right winter wonderland in the winter wonderland i think so um right what team little known fact oh lost connections [Music] what was that server yeah probably three div number one i liked it it was a good server we were on a good team but now maybe we could rejoin it well as well yeah should we do on a different one now let's just let's try it let's do it yeah is um okay yes well it's what we haven't played for a while um us or germany i think you should stick to us really okay little known fact but um churchill actually penned the early barbie girl lyrics um dog dog squad the big dogs i'm a dog and u.s yeah for the big dogs yeah i can't enjoy it yes of course one second one second i have to wait for all the spam to come up no no i can't join the us team as well maybe he will be able just keep clicking join i'm sorry i'm literally spammed my mouse so hard okay i'm in i have the fun wagon oh dog squad welcome to dog getting the fun wagons honey oh you're just it didn't appear in the ui there for a minute you know you're here uh what role do we need empty tank is very important this map okay got it all right there's only one space left well in the in the car wagon i'm coming over there oh my god it's full look at that now get in we come down to the end of the road and left these guys are clones [Music] copyrighted dad there's not a type 2a in this game it's quite realistic it's mostly garand thompson m1 you can play sniper but it's only like one or two people per team that can play sniper west bend left at the end over bump maybe right 45 over crest cat we got angie who's engineer uh we don't have an ng i would hate to be hit with artillery in this truck it would be the worst idea we're just driving straight into the hearts of boy who's driving uh me i'm gonna put garrison here from texas freeman yeah yeah i'll drop uh shifty the sniper is very good it's very good don't [ __ ] yourselves uh freaking wants to do it yeah yeah you building an outpost or something garrison garrison okay don't stand in front of the vehicle everyone in well i believe so well the seats are filled so i'm just gonna go bang it up this road if you want no i don't know about that i think let's just go all the way up here and then go left into foyer now i will say this if we happen upon an enemy tank you'll hear only one warning and that will be alarm and you must step out of the vehicle immediately alarm agaro i'm actually playing this on geforce now so the fps is 60. you get 1080p 60fps on geforce now this is being streamed you're watching a stream within the stream i'm playing the video stream if that makes sense he said he's got a question yeah now you just sound like you just sound like a robot darling for the future country roads take me home to a place dmca youtube algorithm [ __ ] noise what was that it was so loud it was a guy getting out the vehicle it was so loud it really scared me some reason off-road let's go i mean it's not equipped to do off-road though is it yes it is there's more on on the ridge germans we're americans get out i mean you can we can still attack from here or should i just get out here this is one for us i think i should keep the truck because we could use it it's quite a useful thing to have isn't it do you know what i like i genuinely thought we were going to be attacking right yeah but if they take boy if they take west bend we're ready to take boyd well we'll we've got no one on west bend there no there's one squad there guys i made a mistake but we could we could clear some garrisons throughout the boy and then take west bend but we might oh i'm taking shots yeah that's right it did its job that's been paged there could be like um garrisons and stuff here yeah we're gonna attack west bend from the arse oh oh my stream's lagging oh jack's gone yeah gfn is lagging a little bit i'm back we're back in the game a little bit of lag damn it i thought it was i thought i thought i generally thought it was a good boy i didn't know could have kept this truck i think oh here we go it's definitely finished momentarily this place will be an absolute war zone um i just killed one right here yeah it seems quite peaceful at the moment doesn't it well except for that wrestling machine gun that's that's fine fireworks isn't it from well i think they might have some places for you but if we're like reinforcing the rest oh it's kind of nice yeah isn't it i'm going to continue on got him nice job continue on are we headed the right way here the guy really wants his rival johnny we need to just head this way straight and then head south i mean i'm gonna be honest it is open field yeah but we we should be coming into the back of them in an enemy's enemy tank as well could very well be spawned in these forests why are they looking this way that's what i don't understand i don't get why you'd be looking away teammates got shot told them uh ox tornado do you stream battlefield v no i can't stream battlefield games because every time i do uh there's a group of cheaters that just follow me onto the server and uh ruin the game for everyone so i can't stream it battlefield needs a better anti-cheat before i can stream it so i hope the next game's got a better id because i want to stream i like playing the game i know you guys like watching battlefield games so [Applause] yeah it needs uh needs a better handy cheap but i'll do battlefield videos still yeah for sure and of course whenever there's news about bf6 or whatever the next game is called i'll be covering it in videos adam what are the chances i mean that's a lot that's a long shot though isn't that a tank is that it's a dead it's a dead tank um the the driver i'm the gunner got out we shot them both still should destroy it but yeah we should but there's an infantry up there it's alive it's very much on the lodge jack please it's still moving yeah it's got one member of the left stop it okay nice hit oh god it's gonna cut me down oh i can smoke it if you if you want i've only got one rocket another tank coming in second tank returning to basically i'm i'm smoking that tank jack so that he might if he fires a tank shot here we're done another tank here one here both is it rear no no they're both they're both faces remember we have both tanks i've heard it twice but it's no there's barely any damage there you need to get the rear shot nope not safe here well we need to reinforce though i can't play here in enemy territory yeah yeah yeah you're right i was engineer there just trying to put a mine on is that our artillery coming in you can use that smoker's cover maybe i don't want to level up oh horrible horrible if you can get to their west bend square you could put a spawn on it or maybe i'm waiting to see if they they spot me or not yeah just stay there because if you capture west bend you can just put a squad thing straight away down and we can spawn uh that transport truck in front of those two tanks isn't looking ideal i think it's gonna be i'm just gonna get it i'm gonna get a war gin um so there are still two tanks up by you adam yeah yep yeah the transport is just it's driving he's dead i mean i certainly i i just watched that turn from blue to black yeah yeah yeah i mean that's that's no survivors oh my god if they artillery west bend now they're gonna get about 60 kills oh yeah we got people all over it garage limes yeah you can go in the tanks you can uh join the tanks you have to be a tank crew though like i can't jump in a tank as a rifleman for example i could have to switch role and change to a tank roll hey christopher do i have four rockets yeah i do i could have hit him twice so i thought i only had two rockets because i'm usually on the german side of zombie tank i've got four rockets on this class i didn't realize did you find one i fired no i fired two i thought that's the maximum but you you get two with the panzer shrek but you get four with the bazooka yeah is that enemy tank there is that no that's friendly isn't it that's a sherman yeah [Music] we got west bend now this this must be held i'm gonna put some supplies down um nice advantage of the hill i don't know if i had it i'm an engineer as well friendly another random friendly garrison on those supplies but we've got who who could build um yeah 80 on that tank it's just in the middle of the field i got it you right hold right click it's not it's not changed my class i knew i'm just getting in the truck you can hold right click and drop it i did drop one he's shot from the right yep there's a guy on the road right behind me thank you for the heels sadly i'm not engineer because the game refused even though i clicked apply role it doesn't respect that as a decision this game is crazy isn't it guys i know usually i just do videos but uh you're getting to see what it's like what it's like actually playing it it's it's just so crazy so freeman just put a spawn down for us there what's the game called it's called hell let loose hey shifty what's up graham thank you fn yeah we nailed that tank [Applause] well go left so from freeman's little buildings you could probably get a nice little cheeky fat gun set up we'll put some supplies down in that area then oh they're on they're on that point somewhere on the wall at that point yeah adam i just spawned on your garrison i can see you german on the wall behind certainly that was not what we wanted is the deploy still there yeah okay drop the supplies near it well it did unless they've been killed it definitely did yeah i mean johnny just got out of the truck and was instantly killed yeah i i i'd assumed that they were slightly more secure than it was all right i'm back in i mean i can hear your gunfire this part behind that building there's two guys i can't stand yeah this is a really bad position yeah i'll uh well we've got to kill him off here now we need to need to clear this area because this is the key point for taking forward i mean i've tried to change to engineer i just don't get how you do it confirm yes is that good game is that their smoke is that mine if you can get a garrison up in here that would be good watch out there for him and then they were looking at that yeah i know oh wow that's not good okay this thing is from mine or something no it's just this uh friendly guys just following me around i've got one of them in front of us here freeman yeah come on i shot the man following you uh jack because he looks like he was annoying it was an accident tom right complete accident yeah i mean i was shocked where you were reviving me johnny they're in the windows ahead of us yeah yeah that's um yeah i mean i'm revivable again yeah i will get you a lower window right side the battlefield theme then there was someone else doing it i'm about two seconds from death and try and push this bill he's dead he said he's dead are they still in this building no it's not it wasn't right let's see if i can get in the building where are they i don't even know where they are for some saw the other half isn't it this building is clear it is now it is now oh nope there's someone else in it how did i miss that guy he's probably not moving the magikarp yeah he got in that building one just died while she got him yeah i was in the building i think there's only one more in here you're an outpost in this area somewhere yeah but ronnie is there squad communication in this game yeah yeah so the squad leaders see part well she's our squad leader savories charlie's anonymous is baker they can all communicate with each other so the squad leaders can talk to each other and we also have a commander this guy the commander oversees the whole battle and can call in supply drops artillery strikes strafing runs bombing runs that kind of thing and the commander can tell the squad leaders where to go and the squad leaders can talk to each other so you kind of play together and you try and capture the points as you go around the map it's really fun you got that building yeah i've been shot in the background yeah over here no no i don't know i don't know where you were shot from johnny because where that tank was behind my game like i don't get it the explosions are so loud but everything else is not [Applause] not sure what's going on here to cause such a phenomenon our ear punch so this building is definitely clear now yeah i'm pretty sure this fence this fence behind anything oh nice can you guys build a garrison here where is it have on the other side did you clear them out yeah we cleared the outfit okay that's the yeah move well that is kind of how explosions work but i'm just not used to oh left i just said come far on the left oh yeah i see another one there tom [Music] i got one yeah i think there was two there and we got him one further along here yeah no he's dead someone's going yeah he's dead he's a it's only on the wrong side i'm dead macro riddler could get me come on macro riddler i believe in you okay you know oh oh dead one dead ah just got him a split second there's a medic there eugene yes mg was covering that instead oh i see an enemy outpost thank you oh it's a garrison and they all just fall they've got two of them on my body there's a hot there's a big big i can't believe they were able to spawn there i was literally a meter away from it yeah you have to spawn on garrison's no when they're so close they go bright red and you can't see them difficult to see into those windows there for mine there one thing i'd like to see added to this game is uh squad airdrop can we become a commander can call it in so imagine that if your squad could all read the boy and the commander could do a special deploy and you get yet six people power dropped into a place of cover well i'm going behind this garrison bong legend yeah it's in the courtyard johnny were you killed from the building those guys are proud of all the explosions in front of the building oh i've just been shot from the right as i spawned right now i don't see him just amongst the buildings they've got they have the garrison in there it's gonna get some hardcover in reload there's a garrison somewhere i don't know where bong found it i can't i've been looking around this area when i get back to there i'll tell you whether it's been cleared or not oh oh yeah mg yeah is there only there's only two snipers per teams there yeah i think you're right i have done a sniper game play on this game and it is devastating if you manage to get the sniper you can go hand man so good it's only on pc at the moment qr yeah that's it i i do think though eventually they should make this game for next gen consoles i don't think it would run very well on the ps4 or the xbox one like the default ones because it's quite a taxing game because the map is so big and there's a hundred players at once so i think it would have to be next-gen only oh that outpost just got destroyed but i know there's a lot of console players whenever i post a video on this people always say in the comments so is this is this out on console how do i get this on console so there's definitely a big player base out there for console the pack guns you can't we get onto foy i'm on your stick sell them it's just been bombed to buggery where when we can put a new squad spawner over there it looks like they've cleared west bend out as well there was a small insurgent force all it takes is one man though which i still disagree with if it's one man it should take like 10 minutes i can hear a tank of an enemy tank somewhere oh the garrison's still here right here look oh that dude's just team killing me now i never saw he didn't even know i never found it just destroyed it now yeah i didn't find it i couldn't find it either i was like i don't know i'll come a few that sounds like a threat enemy sound there yeah vote kick that guy oh yeah he's just following me around shooting me and stuff accidentally just missed it i'll do it again let's do five more damn it i need to vote again do another vote again i didn't i didn't call the vote yeah this tank is out here i know this corner of all this is the the corner hey thank you what squad is he enough ah dear top squad i can't take out a tank with four front armor shots oh really you have to be really lucky i'm feeling lucky okay i was kicked by the administrator stream they've kicked me because i'm streaming okay really well that's what it says administrator uh does that mean you're not allowed to stream on this server doesn't matter nice [Music] actually that happens with battlefield 3 as well doesn't it because they don't want people to like stream snipe the server so they'd like oh so it's just saltiness there was a couple of well there was like four or five people just following me around there like shooting me and stuff and getting in my way sadly happens quite honestly we can't hide the server we're joining if you want just type it in team speak uh yeah that might be a better idea um i mean they'll probably figure out eventually but it's fine it'll give us a bit of a buffer yeah that happens he'll love that good choice well it's about 10 people i've just left here it's probably more to be honest there's a whole squad of exa squad yeah uh all right let's join let's have a look i'll just turn this up for sake no one's got a good server um just put it into you speak the name uh well yeah someone put one in and i'll join three full squads just left yeah so about 18. does that look good yep that's quite full let's go [Music] well that's not maybe we do maybe we don't jolly maybe we do maybe we don't oh yeah i just saw the sub we left yes uh 18 people down though good that's unbalanced teams found that um there is one it's not a bit of a freaky map but we could try it that's just all right that one's okay you wanna try that one now yeah yeah yeah okay joining all right there we go [Laughter] uh america yeah yeah um oh yeah hi the deploy screen is awesome bye it's obvious what when you're on the map i suppose you yeah but if we join might be full that's that's all yeah us jig jigs up yeah if you're watching the stream please don't follow us i know it's it's just it's really disruptive hey mom i'm on stream we're just trying to have fun and just provide some entertainment that's all so please don't join in and stream cyclists well yeah just playing the game join just play you know if you manage to get on the same server just play like it's fine what's wrong with that like um i'm spawning behind the main point though it's quite a tasty map this one i want to say tasty now we need 50 supplies here bomb can you oblige i'm requested to join adam all right why do we need that yeah well just spoil the deployment he weirdly showed up with a different name jack oh that's weird oh yeah you're yeah i'm jumping on now yeah what gfn maybe yeah that's weird yeah this the the garrison bomb and you can uh build this at least this guy's just that guy's oh no he just deleted it oh it's deployed it's okay i can put another one down is this mid-round this um just at the start and stuff first i'm just absolutely riddling that small stuff are you building tom oh manpower no i mean is that something i don't know if that's a good spot for it considering the hail of gunfire that's coming it's friendly gunfire manpower just gives us well i did yeah you can't you can't jump across the canals yeah they're designed to be you know useful oh wow okay right finally i don't know where i'm controlling i just put a bullet in there i've absolutely been john just got ranged oh do you drown if you go across this all right don't cross the industry little boats i don't know where to go because this is just like very flat like don't we want to fly far to the east across the bridge here let's get across that first this is the metro of hell that loses tomorrow yeah oh it's full grindy the met operation metro of hell swamps then you've heard of swamps yeah guys there's a airhead can just drop in well i just dropped i just crossed the bridge and just got across guys i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna bloody mine the bridge here because i'm gonna do this [ __ ] this is a tummy infantry mind this bridge here okay tuck it right in please just getting absolutely peppered i'll wait here but we're behind him at mountain farm now i spawned on that airhead how did you get there an airdrop it only lasts for a certain amount of time i really don't like all this i'm just absolutely smashed are you ready tom uh yeah i'm just gonna go play some mine over here but it's a bit deadly isn't it i feel like i've ever run across this field i'm dead no i think you're gonna be absolutely kind to this chick did we test just keep going is that an enemy tank there oh big ian um they were they were doing it they were just following me around like some guy early was on the microphone like trying to talk to me um and then they were just standing in my way they shot me a couple times as well can you even get across here i'm gonna drown here aren't i hey you know the marsh is all right oh i just doesn't seem all right [Applause] oh god who's falling in the air place the mine down god damn it adam there's lots of things in the air i don't think i can get across he's dead yeah that's that's a river basically yeah and you instantly start drowning as well yeah this isn't it you know what i'm jumping in space and you can jump in space repeatedly i am literally running beside you guys and somehow i just keep getting shot there because you've got the medic symbol on your head so they shoot you first isn't it i can't even get to the front literally across the ball right now guns are very good on this level i can build a package we just need um we need supplies we need 100 supplies you need a good spot for it well i mean you need first of all need to go back a bit and cross over i mean where's freeman going there's no way over that way yeah there is it's it's impassable i don't know i recognized it where are you going i've got no idea let's see if johnny dies running right next to me i'm gonna see if i can get to madeline farm oh god this is about right that's what it is jack yeah he's probably not getting into the map like waiting to kill us adam you're very far out there aren't you and he's on the wrong side of that river which means he's no way he's getting earnest oh did i get them both yeah i think he got him dead stay there for that just give us one minute okay you build a bridge you cannot build a bridge certainly not or not i don't know actually it would be cool if the engineers could build it like one of the classes had a temporary bridge or something you could build all you've done is you've run down the wrong side of the death river no it's fine this goes all the way down to the point all right is gonna put a lovely squad spawner down for us we're here and it's gonna be lovely this is fine isn't it it's quite damp also in some of these marshes it can suddenly go very deep and i'm dead all right all right it's just a sniper you just need to get ahead put the thing down and don't die come on i heard the shot but i didn't see him i heard a shot oh i see him okay diaper and pack gun is very nice on the stove there's one at the end that i got reloading to the right it's a dog screaming yeah yeah hang on let's get it well no this is that's as safe as you're getting on this map still can't see him adam he's in the forestry area isn't he oh i can't place here hang on yeah oh it's absolutely chad there you go that's nice and safe good luck see you honestly [Music] the sniper is still out there i just can't see him but jack you're going game from where he was he must be just in front here i got him guys he's dead he killed the sniper well i killed a guy in the bus here there's another one with the knight just thrown out get out of there yeah this is dangerous um are you sure this is the canal you're dead i don't know quite broken you're kind of bent around a bush ah that's fine right got him [ __ ] for that there's an outpost here here outpost oh johnny you've got smokes oh just ready keep running jump and then keep jumping and you'll get across it shall i uh let go and respawn no no no no okay samuel hernandez what's up from san antonio texas how you doing man thank you for coming yeah this is a this is a tactical shooter very realistic you die in one bullet from most guns yeah we're playing against real players yeah there's 50 real players on the other team no bots no bots in the game this is an online match it's quite spicy here thank you very much sure left to the front yeah i see him you're going to bandage me or shall i yeah i will go for you ship fans okay i got a couple there you go johnny i think they're in front of us okay won't let me i don't know why let's just sink back into the smoke jack sauce i'm gonna go get tommy oh no i'm long there oh tom i might have smoked i'm long long dead stay in the lung grass stay in the lung brush we should cross the chinese chicken you're dead johnny but what we should do is cross and use smoke there's another person called jack yeah it's very confusing we can kind of go up the um yes look i'll show you away show me there's enemies all around us here no no no no guys come all the way to the edge of the map look it's lovely they'll never expect it i swear we don't we just need to get onto madeline farm though imagine yeah but the smoothness we go round we're nearly on the point no no you're not you've preferred you're you're further than you've ever dreamed just gonna keep crawling up this barbed wire and hopefully i can get on the point that's commando crawling found through my head just ducking out the water hopefully there's no looking at me down this is fine come on i'm a hero oh my god i just got killed run it's very wet oh did you die as well yeah you got me too i was raising you right there it's a bit too deep where i am oh there was another one at the wall i can get with you guys now oh i made a mistake really austin thank you for the 50 that's very kindly man love the game love the channel man favorite gaming channel on youtube austin thank you it's very kindly i appreciate that looks through it yeah that's the sea i'm now pinging a you can mark that on tank map if you want it's not moving uh my ping is that's just a tank jack please fix cyberpunk part 4 4k drew there's nothing i can do about that youtube has screwed me i streamed it in 4k and for some reason it's processed the video and left it at 360p i don't know why it's done that but it just has uh youtube say they don't have any problems with streaming and uh videos not processing it's not true they do because i streamed that in 4k and it's stuck at 360p so all the people who wanted to watch the end of the walkthrough no one's going to watch a 360p are they and if you if you look at the video views you can tell like no one's going to watch that you can't see what's going on in 360p you've got such a gorgeous game like cyberpunk and then you can only watch it in potato quality and uh i mean i i could try and contact them and see if they'd fix it but i don't think there's anything they could do they might just say it's fine i don't know classic by the way tank on this map is absolutely mad are there any uh armor slots freeze respawn we spawn it grout well we can take an armor if you want [Music] there's only one person here you're dead right in front of us here aren't there i can summon a tank if you want jack could be the gfn tank if you can let some more eggs in yeah a tank could be quite cool all right let's do it change roll gfp how do i leave the how do i leave this one leave unit create unit armor squad locked armor unit i'm just going to go out in a blazer glory hold on i believe there's only one tank it's like i'm going to stand up i'm going to go on a blazer glory let's go you're right i'm drowning i'm drowning you can make it across there we have mike's tank here we'll join mike's tank i don't think i'm gonna make it probably don't look at me yeah all right tom i'm dead now so i can redeploy his armor well yeah join mike join my mic squad i prefer if one of you in yours uh no change role crewman right well yeah crewman and then mike squad isn't it mike squad popcorn it's a request i don't know how to accept so there you go there you go now accept crewman i'm just at the back cooper right then uh charmander freeman hq spawn yeah you tell us where you want look how many people are on madeleine farm there is a tank i have to mute the commander because he is speaking in german there's a tank in basically e6 sorry e7 on the road jack on the main road where charlie squad currently is all right okay so yeah i know this one across the river i know this one across the river i'll be just heading down the very middle lane of purple heart lane oh my god i think that's a great idea right i mean would you keep your eyes out for mine so tom that's what jack's here for right now are there any enemy tanks yes okay i think i should keep armor piercing loaded what do you reckon yeah i mean i mean hc is going to be very good i'll tell you that because once you range in groups of enemies on the point that's what you want what we want to do is get to an effective shelling position at madeline farm yeah then we simply start shelling hooning shell bullets in as longer range as we can i like that idea we've got a friendly tank on our ass and what i'd love now which is coming by the way is you can link with another squad straight up soon we'll be able to link with freeman's squads and then we'd see them you know as greens on the map yeah that's when the true memes begin now guys if you're watching the stream and you've never seen tank gameplay in this game it's crazy there's no third person view there's three slots in the tank you've got the driver the gunner and the spotter or the commander so i'm in charge of the turret here but you don't use the mouse you just use the was the keys so you kind of move it like that you have to load each round in individually after you fire it i've got armor piercing shells and i've got high explosive shells i've also got a coaxial machine gun which is great for killing infantry and suppressing infantry so you want to use ap armor-piercing rounds against tanks and you want to use he against groups of infantry that's the ideal scenario but both of those rounds can be effective against enemy tanks if you hit them in the right spot and uh yeah it gets it gets pretty crazy you can zoom in a couple times as well like that it's all about teamwork that's just simple wall we've got a lot of friendly surrounding that madeleine farm now that's right but there's they've got like three tanks around it so we need some try and clear some up i'm moving in like a wall worm i think we'll move to about here and then we'll see where we are then keep an eye on the right jack the thanks okay i'm looking right you see i need to tell me to stop we're going to stop i thought you could aim there is people at the crosstalk stop i think that's a tank there's a little move back a bit move back a bit forward then forward that's fine okay i think it's an enemy tank do we have a spotter freeman i can spy if you want i can change keep going forward forward forward let me use my spotting scope i think that's enemy infantry there yeah there's enemy infantry here that's enemy infantry now there's a tank a bit further up tom if you move forward a little bit i gotta switch to driver hang on you have to do gears and everything don't you yeah i see it i see it hold hold hold i'm gonna put one in his butt friendly it was a friendly tank was it no no that's enemies there must have been a friendly near it then i killed a friendly though all right you standing right next to it probably yeah there was someone standing next to it i mean it's a worthy sacrifice oh i'm just spotting for you well if we can get to this position yeah i found the last tank dance that what we're going to do is move forward a bit then we're going to turn right okay okay i'll keep the turret aim to the front no no it's all right just keep it that way all right well yeah just a bit in the middle oh yeah here we go all right we need to get past that tree line yeah i can't see really because the old edge tell me when it's a clear line to the madeline farm area any anti-tank in the squad that looks good your tank left yeah there's infantry there firing nice nice hit oh they're friendlies i think some uh no no no they're definitely not no they're definitely not friendly so i did have icons why did i kill a friendly no well there's probably people near them are you guys getting them yeah you're right there must have been a friendly near okay about to be kicked for team kills okay uh wait let's just double check there's no friendlies here because that's 270 meters and there is fear not behind there yeah they're friendlies we've just murdered some friendlies let's just not talk about it oh i don't want to get kicked when we write up the report we won't talk about that the icons weren't showing yeah that there the madman farm sell that tell them it's no friendlies on that tell you that can you destroy tanks i'd love that's a teammate okay my icons aren't coming up yeah mine are but they're very small yeah well it's behind the veh he's behind a giant [ __ ] i'm loading h in i don't get it i can't see i've got name plates at 500 meters yeah mine's on at 500 meters as well but some reason they're not showing up all right where's the tank you marked guys i can't see it there's no markings for me okay they're both behind the farm we haven't got a shot on that so we have to go around okay try and find a row round there are infantry at the end of this road though just a bit all right they're so entrenched there yeah i think i just started farm but we've been killing teammates in the dead center that we can't get near the dead center it's just open fields all the way around it all right well we just need to start selling the hell was that hit by that tank it buy a tank and reverse the tank has sucked a team punished yeah that wasn't a successful tank i don't know what happened there but there was a teammate right next to that war as hell i've got a 40-second redeploy though i mean yeah look we couldn't see the name slate so that's kind of annoying i don't know why because mine are on 500 meters so we're saying that we haven't done thomas i don't know mine 500. it's broken this is broken my ping was at 300 meters but i didn't see any nameplates on the miners set to 500 meters and then yeah i'm saying oh why are we on this side of the field river thank god we were marking the tanks yeah but tanks are sadly okay thank you we'll just wait until we might we might spawn some more information thank you for your new beginner i appreciate it what um do you want to wait for the tank tom or well he might spawn in if i ask him what about with all the team kills i think maybe we'll just ignore that and hopefully it's fine i mean i've got 13 infantry kills what's up yeah well that's good come on what's new in germany is that bitter something like that right is that right let's see if you can see again i'm tanking it's i knew and um i don't know if i'll work answer hands are bitter we've got i can oh i've been shot from behind us sorry adam's managed to get on prone for adam you're on the farm put the spawner down should we rejoin your squad jack we can get attached i don't know where he is i don't know how long oh there's a tank tom this is the tank yeah we got it oh i found it i found the garrison come up let's go yes freeman is the hero he goes one two three four all right we won't now what we won't do this time is kill lots of them i do think you killed lots of enemies as well i did yeah i've got 13 infantry kills so i mean before you go on the side i didn't check i had a few but i don't think i had that many what you're saying is it was a rousing success yeah apart from the theme kills yeah but that was that's all part of it isn't it yeah looks like it's just the road to karen's hand left then well we've got to take this first we still haven't taken muddling uh you're all over that like flies around [ __ ] yeah that's going to be capped exercise straight to carrington check out geforce now today for free yeah link in the description the full battle toad isn't she under the bridge like a troll full red hot chili pepper he's no longer someone from 82ad has tweeted to me and said come on play on ourselves we don't boot streamers we've played on 82ad before related to ad love streamers i don't know where the non-dangerous points for the tanks are uh they're all pretty dangerous right because you're like in this field that could be shallow water or it could be the deepest they're behind us well the map tells you doesn't it what's deep water and what's not no it doesn't sometimes it's just smooth i know actually i think it does right if it's got lines on it and it's dark that's deep water right yeah the yeah the dark areas are deep well then we should sit in the water really like a duck and attack people tank is what you're saying the road is very dangerous they are retaking this map to be honest it is misery it reminds me of distribution and misery hey you're taking it you're taking it there's the old fuzzy boy oh no there's german speaking to me jack i don't know what to say i got it nine yeah yeah yeah i think they know that we're english at this point i'm perfect i think the jig is up surely you've got madeline farm now nearly half i mean you can see the capture rate cutting i know but like sometimes it just suddenly goes oh and now it's down again i would like to see the door head to the map yeah they're spawning out there and now it's time for us to enter the duck realm i mean that we're going to end up drowning the tank can't wait not going to end up drowning in the tank that's the last thing we're going to do this doesn't look possible well i think it i think it is do you think that's possible okay we'll go through there freeman let's go very slowly i guess right that's an enemy tank we've spotted on the map for us if we cut this it'll clear out that spawn though yeah yeah yeah you tell me if you think we're sinking well i'm looking at the poles in the middle i'm guessing they're just like waist high so we should be all right if they've designed the map correctly and that's not a telegraph pole we'll be okay all right we've got this we're okay we're okay now we need to get back on the road because the only way so we need to defend this would you like us to hoot over can we dismantle this uh enemy pack gun would you have to look like a satchel charge or something we'll try grenade it don't look ahead there might be man i'm looking ahead oh we need to destroy these now there was a tank on the road wasn't there before all these delicious nodes yeah yeah i had to abandon those earlier all right here we go here we go i'm loading ap because i think there's going to be a tank up here we're going to help back people at madeline [ __ ] hank says behind our tanks but oh i don't know i think it was enemy and i think we destroyed it their own um things to stop us from destroying them okay uh enemy spotted no that's teammate that's a teammate we need a social charge maybe oh well she's just died right next to us uh behind us he's putting a mind on us uh well do you want to go oh god oh my god oh my god in my toe another one oh check out the track and help me where are they this is on me i'm dead i should just stay in the tank maybe if it's all right against me there's a garrison right close to us did you kill him yeah i got him good jump they put a mine on the tank did they are they trying to put mine oh actually they have put a mine down can you dismantle it surely we can dismantle it well i don't know it doesn't look like i can if i drive forward it might be all right [Music] well if you shoot it isn't it going to blow up the tank whatever does we leave and we rejoined the squad we managed to destroy those three men but did they start fillering come on we're just about to get some action there as well turbo's on the last one now i think we can drive forward it'll be fine although can i assess the situation yeah all right give me three seconds i must say we need to build these don't we yeah i'll just put some supplies down for them i can't believe there's a cheeky little swab behind us i mean someone did say 80 behind our tanks can someone please do something about this mine here is wall she comes to fix it for us but i don't know if all she can do is this a rifleman got a bit of a got a bit of a bit of a problem here was she i mean what do i do about this can i like hammer it or something well we're trying to clear this mine i'm not really sure i think if you drive forward it's fine all right that's right is that back i'm standing back well she's got his hammer out and go forward first in bus stone it's fine it's fine it's fine just don't go don't go back tom oh my god what does it mean okay right okay i'm in it's fine it's just it's just a dilemma of world war ii that's it it's it's a it's an everyday run-of-the-mill world war two thailand i've still got that ap round loaded okay well there's there's definitely gonna be people on the road ahead of us here there's a friendly transporter there's a friendly tank in front of this truck what do we do so let's cross the river yeah yeah okay supplies we're not far we're about one swear from you guys or the road to counter oh some [ __ ] hmm all right we've pushed down the way it's fine we're on the road to carrots and city maybe we should not be on the road you know over here we're gonna go over here jack this is a cool area to go isn't it oh [ __ ] i think our teammate just got shot ap my ap rounds loaded yeah ap is loaded okay is enemy infantry a bed oh look that is 100 a team mate and oh no it's not there's another behind us like danger clothes right behind you like literally behind you i don't see any enemy tanks that's infantry yeah i got him i got him i've got an infantry behind us stay there all right he's dead 100 the more infantry out there tom i'm dead yeah turn your tank around i need to shadow your meme around you want to turn this around yeah turn the turret into the little crossroads behind us there's some outposts people spawning with mines running it behind you oh my god that tank they just put artillery strike on the road we're fine we're fine i'm deploying jack but it's going to be a while before i get back to you you might want to change the driver and maybe reverse a bit i don't know how to drive right oh good luck but there is infantry behind you and that's the one thing you didn't want they're in that building aren't they yeah i'm running down jack i'm running down can i put an armor piercing shell through the building well i hate she yeah could you clear this um it's behind us or is that not where your business right if anyone is in that building they've been ruined they've been absolutely rude okay stop buying it now because i'm about to approach it i hope you've not just exploded jack no no we're well i'm i'm here jack but i'm i'm trying to try to spot where their spawn is over here i mean i shelled the crap out of that building tom if i reckon they've got a spawn further along somewhere you know some okay little spawn um i reckon we're pretty safe now because we got inventory surrounding us okay i'll come back to you then i'm not 100 yeah i know i can see an enemy is that an enemy i think that was an enemy truck i just took out artilleries coming in there's enemies i can hear you there's enemies still behind you yeah i need a position to shoot i can't put smoke down as well i'm trying to get i'm trying to get to you but it's being troublesome we need to link up with dog squad but we can only really go on the road guys where's dog squad are you guys on the road just take it four times he's gone let's take us to the point time and see what happens i think it's a great idea well someone just died to our left so there's someone on that 100 all right i took out the absolutely oh they just got annihilated it did they're dead it did okay there can't be many of them on both carrots on left is that friendly or enemy artillery i can't see anything through that smoke there's no one on that bridge line full cent on full send i'm going to go over here and i'm going to turn left onto the point all right okay send it uh chadley bond said it don't work on with his uh he just hit firing his
