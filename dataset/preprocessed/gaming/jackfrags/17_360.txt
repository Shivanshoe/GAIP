skill based matchmaking some people love it some people hate it's good some people have never heard of it and couldn't care less but what if you could turn it off it's not like there's a button you can just press and it goes away but if there is sign me up for that i'm just kidding but seriously watch a couple weeks ago when the dansk 84 map went live raven software also introduced a new game mode for the main map resurgence now we've seen this before on the smaller map rebirth island up to the third circle as long as a single member of your team is alive you will redeploy it's a fun game mode i like it a lot and it solves some of the issues with the mid game in normal vr now myself studying westy have been playing this for about a week most days early in the mornings and i feel like i've got enough experience on this now to say that there is no skill based matchmaking in this game mode and that makes it interesting why well it's a night and day experience from playing in normal trios or quads the fights are completely different there's way more variety in the operators that people pick in other words there's not rose skins and that new battle pass skin that's basically rose 2.0 bunny hopping everywhere it's much more casual and you don't have to sweat your face off to get a victory royale plus because not everyone in the lobby is using meta weapons in their loadouts you can use non-meta weapons too and still be competitive it's a right or good time and it normally feels well balanced in terms of the skill range in the lobbies and it reminds me of the first few weeks of warzone when everyone was just learning stuff having a laugh and those matchmaking algorithms haven't built up accuracy occasionally though you do get a full baby lobby where you clearly outmatch the skill of 99 of the other players in there again some people will enjoy that but for me too much of that is a bad thing because i just get bored i get lazy and there's no challenge to it i turn off in an accessible arcade game like cod i prefer a healthy mix of skill levels randomness is what i enjoy in terms of the other players in my lobby you never know what you're gonna get keeps me on my toes that way but the game that you're gonna see now was full fab never go full back but at least it can demonstrate what these resurgence lobbies can be like it's as if you're playing with skill based matchmaking turned off they are great for leveling your guns up though let me tell you that so i took my ram 7 build in this one here it is if you'd like to copy my homework i won't tell as always a big thank you to all these lovely folks using my code in the cod store jack frags in caps if you buy something using my code tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one and with that said let's get into the gameplay if you like it leave a like let me know your thoughts on skill based matchmaking down in the comments below how do you feel about it as a regular warzone player
