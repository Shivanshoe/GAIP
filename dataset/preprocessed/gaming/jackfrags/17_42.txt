okay battlefield 2042 patch 4.1 he's out now some good gameplay changes but apparently there's a lot of stuttering so we're going to try it out it's my first match on here on breakaway i'm going to be going through some of the patch notes and trying to play the game at the same time i've also put the performance graph in the bottom left there so if you do get these stutters we can kind of see all right there was one there it was yellow wasn't it what's that cpu another massive one there you guys see that you can get this truck yeah there was some massive spikes there on the cpu i got like three stars in a row then so we're gonna be using the ak today they buffed the rate of fire on the burst mode so i'm going to try it out i think it's going to be pretty decent beam there from c1 nice little rock here okay that felt good did that if you know the boris turrets as well and they've also knocked angel massively so he can no longer give out armor with this little supply bag i'm getting hammered by that thing this burst ak is nice though man so yeah if you want armor you've got to get it from the um from irish or you can pick it as a gadget i think that's it no wait if angel rezzes you you can get armor as well i think there's still there that's like five or six already these nades okay this air guy's really good at this distance anyway try and throw it out as much as i can hold a hovercraft why not no you know i'll get a ranger this uh stuttering could be related to because there's been a new build of the game like hashing the shaders you know how it was on um the f1 would be fi the first time you played a map it would be a bit laggy a bit stuttery because it would catch the shaders and then the next time they'll be fine but we'll see it might be that but i thought that they'd done away with that in this game i'm gonna come here a little bit further yeah i thought that they'd uh change that technology because it's like a new version of frostbite and i haven't had that before on 2042 so it might be that might be something else but i mean it's happened quite a lot already to me so i feel like it is a it is a thing another one there another two there oh man you can feel that yeah some of the um other changes they've made a bit too far away from the ak then maybe it put the volte that thing there you got it they put that in the armored vehicle category so you shouldn't really be seeing as many of those which is a good change and they've also removed 128 player breakthrough i know a lot of people might not like that because maybe that's all they played we're doing all right for me personally i just hated 128 player breakthrough it's just chaos it just didn't work at all so you can only play 64-player breakthrough now and maybe they just didn't have their player base to accommodate 64-128 and made the decision to i'm gonna kill here the rocket made the decision to just put one of those game modes off and ranger i actually saw that rocket hit my face it was like he was in slow according motion the patch notes they have improved aim assist for console and controller players and i don't play on controller on this game so i don't think i could comment on that but i did read a post on reddit 2040 subreddit a guy called the bomb or something like that and apparently it is a lot better now but please uh you know try it out for yourself a little guy in here isn't it they couldn't have been on full hp that was the ak just that good now yeah let me know if you play this on console it is that good ow how is it now yeah how is it on controller is the aim assist better more consistent they also said that they reduced the input lag there's a little turret down there we got it another couple of stutters there as well very nice hey see there you go irish rocking the armor i think a lot more people are going to be playing as him now it definitely seems to be related to cpu spikes isn't it every time it's happened there's a big yellow point that shoots up in the air and some people on twitter i saw was saying that it's happening all the time but i think the fact that i've got an intel i9 top spec cpu maybe that's helping a bit with it and perhaps if you've got a lower spec cpu it's going to be worse but i hope that dice say something about this and look into it because if it is just shaders like first time you play the map a lot of people on this ice if it is just shades it should be fine the second time that you load them up how am i still alive here this is mad actually using grenades on me now i won't kill this dude here [Laughter] sorry frogs there's another one there get him gonna know him down yes good job see what people say in the chat not i guess that means no that's funny there was another big one there yeah a little but not that much i think like regardless of the fact if it's just like a one-time thing the first time you load the map with the shaders boom did we get it we got it now yeah regardless if it is just a one-time thing per map like i think they should have maybe warned people i know sometimes you don't know but oh there was a big one there if something's changed with the game or the engine and uh you know there was a potential of this happening maybe just well ruined by the condor maybe just saying beforehand first time you play the map it might be a bit laggy you know like they have in cod modern warfare vanguard and in war zone if it's a new patch or something you get that message at the top it's like building shaders there's one more here somewhere it was right there oh no boris rest in peace boris i'm sorry enough to tour it didn't they look in the chat it's crazy for me stutters yeah me too jack is carrying the team hello that guy's angry with the stir i won't say i'm carrying the team though i'm doing all right i'm getting this truck minigun is quite effective against that wow no go back what's going on dude go away this bloody attack helicopter man makes me wish i had the m5 or stinger or something two people here there's one i've got a reloading i can't believe they're just hiding there like that shotgun as well i feel like my chat is broken [Laughter] perfect time to get started oh lucky to be alive there oh that was a good one right there that still was nice i could put a bigger scope on it mate one there oh that turret isn't gonna do you any good it is kind of nice though not to always fight people who have armor what the blinding nuclear light what the hell was that that guy's finally dead was that thing wasn't it explosion i wasn't even looking at it what is this angel doing [Music] okay yeah ak's like my favorite now i'm going to use this a lot pretty good in philadelphia as well that's too far away that's it quite a close game though sometimes they just line up for you it's starting here as well spectacular what you see that look i'm sorry i mean i am as shocked as you you know what i'm gonna try i'm just gonna quickly see if i can get another game on breakaway and see if it's still doing it because if it is the shaders then it shouldn't stir again it's doing it here as well look i wonder if it's related to the ui then look at that that's mad lots of cpu spike in there that doesn't seem right okay i'm gonna see if i can just get on another breakaway quick okay i've restarted my game i found another server on breakaway 128 player conquest and i'll put the graph on let's see if it's still doing it yeah okay straight away i did it straight away so it maybe it's not a shaders thing then maybe this is an actual problem i think this is a problem it did it almost instantly there it's not done it again there's another one felt that another one yeah okay right so i don't think it's a shader's thing i think yeah there's oh my god that was a big stutter there yeah okay right this is an actual problem this isn't a shader's thing as far as i'm concerned well that's screwed i mean the patch is good in terms of like gameplay changes there's a lot of changes here that make sense in terms of balance and stuff but they've got to try and fix this stutter like asap because imagine imagine you're someone who's come back to the game after some time off and there's a new patch you expect it to be better but you're just seeing this stuttering so hopefully they can remedy this i mean fingers crossed the it's something they can fix server side without having to do another patch because they would have to get that certified and approved on the console channels and the pc patch wouldn't go live until that happened because they're the same build of the game i think because it's cross-play so i mean it's not looking good is it yeah that seems pretty bad there we go guys that's a first impressions look at the new patch let me know your thoughts in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more i'll see you
