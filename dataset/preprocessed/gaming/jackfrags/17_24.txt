today we're playing something really unique this is an fps rhythm game called metal hellsinger where when you shoot to the beat of the music you do more damage and score more points increase your combo i'm having a blast on the demo so far and a big thanks to funcom for sponsoring this video if you want to try out the demo for yourself the link is down in the description below all right let's do this [Music] get the shotgun straight away in the demo we'll do a take down there as well you have to press e on the b as well for the takedown if you miss it it doesn't do anything you see the right and left arrows on either side of my crosshair that's the b so you've got to try and time it to that as well as you can there we go so that's the secondary on the skull there which is called pass and now that i'm at 16 combo as you can hear the vocals have kicked in you could do the reloads on the beat as well like that oh my god it's so satisfying there's just something about nailing those reloads man [Music] i think that's actually alyssa from arch enemy as well so i've got some really talented vocalists on this so many souls here makes a kind of electricity [Music] [Applause] [Music] right click their special it's good to try and dash on the beat as well [Music] you can get a triple dash combo this is the double revolvers they're called the hounds in this game little mini boss guy here try and get those head shots [Music] that's a secondary it creates a copy of me that will shoot at the demons a bit of a sentries turret i think it's also a nice distraction as well if you get in trouble [Music] yeah they've also got surge from system with a down on here they've got the lead vocalist from trivium and this one there that reloads the best oh nearly got me [Music] really good for aim training you know i need to dial in my sense so i can uh match it with like cod and battlefield so i could use this to practice on it's a bit more fun than the name map now we can move on again [Music] i've played through this a couple times already there's a boss here a minibus dodge me those orange floaty diamond things are really useful explosions we got them get some health back use the sword for a bit i messed up the time in there that little combo there if you hit that on the fourth beat [Music] yeah like that and you can use past this skull here to keep your combo up doesn't really do much damage if you've got a gap in the music where there's not really any enemies to choose at maybe you're on the other side of the arena you can just use that to keep hitting on the beat maintain that combo i love these revolvers downs gives me like serious sound vibes at times obviously doom as well it feels good like the fps mechanics in this are pretty crisp like the aiming's nice don't feel any input lag or anything like that pretty important in a rhythm game isn't it what's interesting about the music too is that it has layers to it but because i'm mostly keeping my combo above 16 you're hearing a lot of vocals we're kicking in a second if i didn't have that multiplier i need to get around here then you might just hear the drums or the guitars and it builds up so how intense the music is a little charge up there yeah how intense the music is that's a reflection of how well you're performing in the game [Music] oh i should have done take down man [Applause] oh my god nearly dead i don't like this guy [Applause] i think you get more points if you do the takedowns as well we'll see how i do at the end on the leaderboard [Music] [Applause] i'm sure if you're someone who really gets into that kind of thing in rhythm games and fps games like this leaderboards are quite important cool to compare with your mates as well so you can do the best [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wave goodbye to your head right this is up to the boss now i love the level design [Music] [Applause] got a really fun start this boss fight the boss disappears moves around you've got to dodge these try and dodge them these things will give your health back i'm gonna use the alt here on the sword watch this i saved this for you [Music] yes i love it smash you just get a feel for it you know the more you play it [Applause] can't damage the boss when they're like ah now we can use the sentry [Applause] [Applause] [Music] there with that right the face quick infernal justice give it to me right click on this freezes everything and then you can on this you can shoot and explode one of these green guys i have to dodge that bit mistake down there destiny [Music] see if we can finish him off here try right click it here we go yes we got him aspect defeated sweet so satisfying man the music is actually good as well this all comes together nicely
