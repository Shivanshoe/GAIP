that come up here we got a quiz for you okay who won this hand of poker night keep in mind i don't play poker tom well it's fine that's the quiz no one help him so we've got a five and a seven is twelve how we got they did what were you doing together i don't know i don't have to play poker four eight six six five four eight six six five yeah seven five okay so there's only two pl you can only see the two player's hands this one in that one i mean surely the double the double aces one well this guy's got pocket rockets so there where's bong you can come up pocket rockets this guy's got pocket rockets this guy's got a five and a seven and on the table we've got another five a six a six an eight and a four now those two who wins guys it's a trick question isn't it i think the five and the seven wins because she would think that pocket aces wins but there's probably some dodgy rule okay so how you play poker it's the best five cards you can make from your hand and the table i know but they're not all clubs some of them are yeah but is there far is there five numbers in this row four five six seven eight yeah okay so that's that's good so then there's this guy's got two aces so who wins how do you tell i've got no idea i don't know i mean that's only a pair of aces to the pair right it's a high pair but it's still a pair yeah now you it the five of the seven wins stacks there's five and seven yeah five and seven he would yeah it's just straight the guy went through this straight not all right he went because he was straight yeah he gets four but they're not the same color doesn't matter it's not straight flat it's not a straight flush or a royal like it's just four on the table there and he's got these there's a five on the table as well but it's the seven that makes it the straight in his hand but does it matter that there's already a five on the table no not really the the reason this guy wins is because he's got a seven which which completes the straight from the on the table but this guy's just got pocket rockets so his hand would be two aces two sixes and an eight that'd be his best five i'm really confused so would you just um ignore the other five then that's there already no you don't ignore the other fight oh the other five yeah you ignore that one because your best hands from the top of your best hand this guy could make it's what you think it's four five six eight and then plus the seven poker confuses me man this is an easter egg if you go into dark side there's a qr code and you scan that and it goes to a blog about the band that's true oh wow yeah um also they didn't look like they're from 1894. no that's last week isn't it in germany somewhere uh what just your i don't know how to play burger but let's have a look he's got a five and a seven that's 12. oh god i literally don't know how to play it oh i'm just making an assumption i mean you make no that's fine i mean it's true that wasn't it you think right yeah underneath oh and there's another guy right here somewhere moving up oh god i'm going in no no no no i'm down nice one here i'm gonna heal he's in jack there's a lady with a white shirt black ponytail in by the corn on the roof they're getting here tom i can hear a lot of people around oh just fired again at me yeah like here somewhere behind the hay yeah behind your head is there not one on the roof with you yeah molly in that hay this is a vicious [ __ ] fight guys let's get rid of the bus ah thank you chunk him what's this in with us no matter is it dynamite yeah he's throwing something oh that's instantly killed me all right for the are they up there yeah you got one you got one nice right on to on the metal i'm gonna flank and get around there see if he jumps down he might jump down yeah i've got him if he does down nice i think that's everyone surely that was hot combat that was i enjoyed that well the gentleman this game is nuts are they moving looks like they're at the south of upper descent i think they're probably waiting to see if we extract because we've got an extract right next to us so um obviously if they've run over to try and stop us and we just go to that extract they've got they've got a chance to stop us if we head out towards them maybe that'll test their colors see what they do it looks like they're going kind of we're both going diagonally towards that south exit they're going to get there before us this will be a terrible wang if uh end up losing the bounties after killing the other two teams they're going for a wide fight maybe yeah they've got long range then what hopefully they don't spin and see me i think i'm nearly on them right one's very close to me egged him once black's pushing with the funny one's like next to me jack he seems like that blue shirt one there there's one here a rifle tag him in the back i don't have a rifle i've got a shot they're pushing you tom don't try and close the gap without hearing me fingers crossed you realize how close he was got a crossbow hit register oh my god die if a reds go for us yeah i'm on it gonna push that corner i got me oh lucky you got this tommy oh he got his friend up oh unlucky man nice try that was crossbowed mad there's john up there i can't believe john's standing here like what he you don't you're saying that after do you know why is he up here like it's insane no what are you doing up here bro he doesn't seem to be reality he doesn't understand yeah that was from 105 east yeah he missed john just by like i had air i saw the bullet hit yeah i'm on the outside wall now they're shooting at me i firmly got their attention oh god yeah shooting one you guys shooting me zach i'm moving up a bit both in the garden maze just outside the house it's three in total right you don't see him jack no not yet by the tree in the courtyard one down nice long you might be able to get the guy the red shirt oh my left let's go got another one reloading i can hear the last guy i think i he's throwing something did i get him i was on that corner i tagged him once yeah nice well played the old flankie worked out a treat in the end i just crouched away and they didn't hear me i mean you guys would just be shauna as well i think that helped yeah oh yeah i was just literally wanging around in the windows on the balconies just jumping around like a freak if we're getting this house that'll be a good place to see him so i've only just got the bounty maybe we can catch him out get across now i don't see any are you in my building now bong is just holding here for a sec oh someone behind you yep i'm down tagged him once shot me through a window thing i've got the guy down below i'll get track careful because there's a few teams here yeah there's multiple there's more [Music] right on me oh god i'm so lucky rezzing jesus christ he's down healing if i go down again i'm done on anything uh if you've already got three large health bars then yeah i've got one large too small okay we've got one northeast like here somewhere someone just find a shot southwest yeah yeah i see the guys southwest ow explosive ammo behind us behind us as well yeah yeah two two behind two behind where exactly here somewhere you got one further back here where's him he's got explosive sparks yeah he's got explosive yeah don't know it's just century sparks he headshot thanks it was a sports headshot i think then so i may have downed him i'm not sure he's good shot with that this guy's got adults precision down right guy down left guy is still up he's minced me i can't i can't peek anymore he's going to try and go for a rest bobby's there pushing our building ow is he further left jack now i can't see he's gone further right towards the body that's him feeling times at once i'm out of heels what's her injury i'll stay here then did she make it across them yeah there was the fella skin i sagged her once oh [ __ ] one underneath uh like basically underneath you with this uh shotgun right in the building but under the under the balcony like that you're stood on there's a guy with a shotgun i hate the prospect of that did you move now anything i don't know here's someone east drama he could probably get the bounty off my body i hate being trapped like this get in the fence nice i'm gonna go for bong he's holding the corner there don't peek home doesn't have any heels you think you saw that i mean he's holding the corner i think yeah [Music] looking for an angle way too intense that window tom that little little slat you can peek that i'll try and get you here adam yeah yeah yeah maybe ow hold on hold on [Music] i'm staying just jack because he can't kill you through there is he in he might be in tom no he's lying you can revive jackie's on his last health bar though i i downed the shotgun guy tom so we've got someone north east has anyone got any heels for me or oh does it ever end game cover getting covered getting covered i'm out of heels some yeah i'm also out i've got my last health bar as well reloading how many are left though surely there's only like one or two left are going nice down them yeah yeah down down down uh he was over here i don't know there's one more in the building still yeah i heard something stop moving a sec [Music] no i don't hear any of the footsteps i'm almost certain there's one left there is because i need to loot a body and get a dark side thing holding the barn maybe oh yeah i got him all played that might be the last one no no there's probably three in there we're clear we're clear yay oh my god how do we survive that i don't know the filling fights back i call that it's a full 13 hours that's mad that's actually mad that we're all live by the way yeah yeah but luckily even if we even if you've got red skulls we and we survived yeah then we can actually get people back now oh they added that didn't they yeah are we just gonna evac now huh everyone's dead oh what what would you need i think i need a heart transplant after that one
