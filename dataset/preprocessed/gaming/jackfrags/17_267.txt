hi everyone and welcome back to more call of duty wars and today we're playing with tomographic stone and foglet and i wanted to do a little test we're going to play a few rounds and see if the m4 is still relevant is it still competitive in this day and age of war zone where cold war weapons just dominate i've had so many people over the last couple days like tweet me send me messages going why don't we see anyone using the modern warfare guns anymore what's what's with that well it's because they're just not as good they're just not as good anymore and i wanted to do a little experiment today a little bit of a test and we'll see can they hold up we're holding for deployment i think the m4 can still be quite competitive i think it could still be pretty good but it really depends on the distances that i'm fighting at and the kind of people i'm fighting what guns they're using as well so i can't just run into buildings and and play super duper aggressive you know i'm gonna have to maybe sit back a bit take my firefights a bit carefully we'll see how it goes yeah i've never actually played with fog lit before either but i've heard he's a really nice guy and a good player so drop it into the area i'm looking forward to this a nail gun though hello he just stunned me in warmer this is unbelievable but thank you for tuning into the stream guys if you're watching this live

know so yeah what do they say uh something about the train doesn't stop there you mentioned something yeah trying to stop into the platform i wonder if there's actually any easter egg right now that could be solved or if it's all just hype for them when was the event happening in a couple of days thursday 30 ps2 gotcha earlier [Applause] all right see if we can pop off here gentlemen this might actually just be yeah it's not like i don't know [Applause] i'm getting heaps of money here i don't know it's definitely a different looking do you think they added something by mistake yeah i wouldn't be surprised really i've never heard of that that's absurd it's crazy oh i'm rich well done on the roof i think there's more though okay hey get the load out they were crawling to that moving yeah it's getting like so much loot over here dude we got so much money what the heck oh my god yo guys we got so much money oh there's so much money guys look at this wait tom are you seeing this bro tom wait a time let's do it youtubers and go get ourselves some landlords much money dude you know you just push in the direction you're going and it fixes it right now oh nice just quit the game though whether it's guarding you hang on yeah oh f4 install yeah just do alt f4 how you turn hacks onto a thousand stars right here let's give you a thousand [Applause] slim what's he right the real raw bacon slim yeah apparently he's just behind the vent but he's very fresh not bad very crazy fresh he was very cracked what does that mean fresh oh damn crash what does that mean no what the heck is that must be a british thing why can we see this down the map there can you see it fresh was global it's weird what would they call crash jack um not all questions [Applause] it's a nursery no it's a nursery yeah but then they see they don't know what not a nursery is what stone do you know what nursery is a nursery is like yeah you know where a baby is yeah you go and put your baby there while you're going you have like a nursery room or whatever that's the crash though isn't it it's the same thing the crash stone you must have heard the word people are saying crash that's a date here yeah daddy daycare that's it yes that's it that's what i was trying to think of no i've never heard chris mommy and daddy are going on a date we're going to put you in crash getting a crash child basically stone there were babs and then they just like have a br yeah that's basically what that team wants gotcha made the best all the toddlers have to fight for mommy and daddy's attention getting pretty good toddlers random weapons like one of them gets a stake one of them gets a pacifier a rattle [Applause] yeah [Applause] that one's just really comical though doesn't do any damage sounds like the new battle royale game we need like that's the worst ttk the squeaky toy yeah definitely it's really funny as well when you get depends what attachments you put on it it depends how you build it this makes just makes your opponent laugh when you hit them it's not very effective let's get closer angela i mean you have to be close range yeah that's true that's true that's true we are notorious for just pushing us and for some reason it just seems to be funny forever do we need ammo by the way kindergarten oh they'll go for that story and that's what i was trying to think wow beautiful so good poor guys stopped at the wrong place extra uh cash down here that's a lot of cash oh um yeah i'm going to drop the rest of mine do you think they're ever going to fix that bug where you're just continuing i don't know am i the only one that has it no no i just no that's what jack that's what tom was talking about earlier if you interact with it like a loadout or a buy station and you're pressing a movement key it will do it yeah i hope they have the um customize your loadout in the pre-warm-up about way out again but i think it will just cause problems all the time yeah that'd be good there'll be a way to exploit that problem well did you see they implemented it and then yeah but because it like obviously in plunder when you select your loadout in the pre-warm up you get it for the rest of the round and you were able to customize the loadout before going into the match but then there was this like rare occasion where you'd actually get with going to the map with your loadout and start vr with the oh they're breaking right here oh dude that was the craziest time when that happened yeah oh crazy stuff upgrade you'd get it for the match you could have like permanent dead silence right feel free to give these wankers uh right side right at the corner [Applause] spot [Applause] behind the pyramid [Applause] it's not cool bro same spot you're not that guy you're not that guy pal that was such a weird video man yeah you're not that guy it's so wicked tom you're not that guy jack wasn't it about wearing a mask in the store or something i think maybe i can't remember the full video i just see that specifically chopped up on tik tok all the time yeah yeah i think i've seen the whole thing they were asking him to wear a mask in the store and he wouldn't do it oh this is out of combat zone that's nice that's outside [Applause] yeah this is because we're in the goose [Music] that really sucks i'm going in the airport i don't have uh oh there's more tail up here [Applause] i can't help up on purple i've been stunned do you see anything yeah he's pushing white damage thank you that's a cool scope ugly i like that yeah this this tundra is nice it's got rocket boosters on it what the hell yeah there's like a little spaceship does it do has it got a unique inspector anything it does with the right barrel but i i don't use that one oh i thought they

news jackie [Laughter] get with the times bro oh boy what if it's world war ii though that did look like a russian world war ii sniper whoa it did dude you can play from all different areas dude create what like warzone like like warzone portal or something wow they could name it that maybe it's crazy i don't know about that tom that would be amazing wow extreme that was amazing that we got the we got the the rare easter egg ending that's so rare that is i don't know what the chances of that are but i i mean that's the first time i've seen it what if it's world war two uh gilbert thank you for the five man that's very kindly jack i've been with you since that cha boy and azzy videos thanks for getting us through the pandemic no problem gilbert man thank you for watching stream sniper yeah i love that uh jack kirby's knife monkey great name thank you for becoming a member uh sleepy dyer thanks for the five great stream do you think 2042 will be free on xbox game pass um well i know that ea games are on xbox game pass i don't know if they're all on though like with bf 2042 being like a massive title and so much hype for it i think what they'll probably do is either microsoft will pay a crap ton of money to ea and they'll have it day one or they'll do something like it'll be available a month later or two months later or something like that [Applause] i think it'll be on there eventually yeah [Applause] the lady that killed you look so happy yeah she was really happy to snipe me off the helicopter i was like trying to escape with my friends shake for answer what's this watch i've gone okay let's ask it a question is bf 2042 going to be game of the year doubtful is the new card going to be any good no [Applause] will i ever reach 10 million subscribers on youtube probably not that's probably right dude this uh this watch is accurate man is tomographic a better player than me [Applause] maybe it's up for debate hostile dropping into the area watch the skies how's the sweat for you guys in the evening compared to the day it depends where you're playing like at the moment we're playing america because i think we're on for glitz lobby he lives central so it's good for the ping so it's what six hours behind so it's coming up to the evening it's gonna start getting really sweet uh kieran thank you for the 10. been watching since bf3 days thanks for all the great content that's what kind of man i'm hyped can we get that's win number two of the stream can we get another one and we get another one and we've got the easter egg uh let's try over here okay or is there i don't know quarry but there's pretty good ludia though right okay no it's great and if we don't get enough we can go over towards dealer yeah come on man i want [Applause] yeah he's got a pistol though tom yeah purpose that's crazy or are you just insane my heart still pumping from the end zone of that last match dude that was crazy we just went through palm do you want to ask my magic question um yeah sure come on then ask your question um what is no it's kind of i know yeah yeah yes no to be debated um will the next cod game be world war two [Applause] i don't know man i think it might be futuristic it said probably [Laughter] it could be in the future i think it could be like 2143 i am actually crying hopefully expecting that he's like shout gusting honestly i think it might seem let me see the future i think it's going to be a futuristic one i'm just going to throw another [Applause] you never know will the new card have an anti-ship try again later they said uh they said that their work they were working on something right yeah so many people after that were like is it gonna be is it gonna be in the new season do you think they're gonna know they're gonna have an anti-cheat in season five i mean season five isn't over you gotta you gotta get something for your money hopefully it might be a mid-season update maybe mid-season oh these guys they they trapped the uh truck here i think it makes marketing sense to release it though when the new game's out right like yeah oh hey look at this guys we've got a new anti-cheat that we've been developing but also do they want it to be like uh the mate like the major thing people are looking forward to is an anti-cheat it's like the thing that all the news articles that's the truth though isn't it that's what people are looking forward to is content in 2021 uh i'm getting there without money let's get another question does jack love me if you're lucky oh it wasn't a no [Applause] no it wasn't yes either i do love you that's a good answer even though we've never met you know i feel like we'd be good on my toes yeah i think she's just making me laugh all relationships i'll stop or something there as well [Applause] hey jacob i'm good thanks how are you there's a result oh yeah rez just went up there too storage yeah the rest in storage should try and get on the back side of the pool maybe oh yeah yeah dummy okay okay well let's capture that does she still say that yeah man it's okay that's yeah that's our alarm clock sound telephone friendly uav over here

pocket and push the hotel guys how could you [Applause] honestly sorry i'm not impressed it's weird that they've closed the door here like you used to be able to run inside this building i didn't even realize oh i got another two yeah more cash you could couldn't you there's purple building the jacks on you could run in there before and then yeah now it's the now it's the uh [Music] i was just shooting vic that was their names susan beck right yeah don't you know that sure friendly uav over here everybody knows oh you ain't getting away that easily boy it was done you did you're fine [Applause] he's gonna wait oh he's coming down we're here we hit this one ah shoot oh i almost hit it was that just death yeah i say i'm almost there i want to nervously there's one more crate coming down here it's probably the super boys oh yeah hello oh good eyes jeez crazy you're crying [Applause] down with no careful you're right he's driving away now i'm counting on it [Applause] you're counting on him to drive away he's at the buy station he's running into another oh there's someone shooting at him [Applause] give me that aim oh i got a uav let me just pop that sucker out of that m4 friendly uav overhead easy beams fog come on let's see it all right mate come on mate come on come on oh i might that was mine mate oh you missed it i got killed from super in the vehicle and the vehicle in the vehicle i want this man dead he's not allowed to escape [Applause] he's on the right side of the vehicle when you go in the building give him a chance you know or they find someone mother oh there's a lot of people there wow enemy soldier i don't have a close quarter weapon it's a proper fight i love that perk so much so good indeed all you have to do is tank them with a grenade i would say that was hard but that was three advanced uav hey we got a free little woman that they could have had that was so weird what are the odds of that imagine the games were having today the timing on that was great because usually you can't open this door right yeah yeah well i turned around and the bar had gone and i just opened it and there was just a rose skin that teleported in no way okay you're lying you're an actual liar if i'm asking questions of course even though i'm not i mean the watch is wrong so everything gets said is wrong up until now also the next card game is likely to knock you off that's good again will the next car game be world war two yes oh i think it's gonna be world war two boys be man the last chord was revealed in doesn't it come out like they reveal it no no it was august again last year wasn't it that was like earlier then no it was late black ops 1 was it yeah it was like oh because it was in war zones yeah you stayed like uh like a week after that or before it wasn't a nuke event it was the uh you know you find woods and yeah yeah stadium one but you find woods inside there yeah but then a nuke goes off you have to run to stadium right and literally crawl out the open whoa blue stadium open it it doesn't go off it just has a nuke sound yeah we don't ever see like a cut scene or anything because this well you see a cut scene in the um if you do the intel for modern warfare it was like captain price killing oh no the nuke never went off by stone [Music] alone yeah that's so weird though because like that cutscene is so good and they've obviously put so much money and time into it and it's just like a little easter egg i'm not going to start to record his voice from home or something for that one and it's pretty pretty pivotal to the modern story sorry broken off the throne guy i mean they're all down whoa these guys knew instantly where was it i'm leaving again still there ruined their day i don't know why they continue to go for it after seeing their first teammate go down just this is fine it's fine isn't it it's safe guys i can get it i can get it you died i can't tell oh yeah but the world by the way he's one he's one surprise the second time on the hotel what if they go for it again i'd love that so much dude what if they go for it again there's a guy there this is what i'm saying oh my god we're the same you and i how did i get that kill i got him i got him [ __ ] it oh thank you sir there's one more out there yeah yeah i see him another one damage oh you're shooting out there [Music] gotta finish on another one so i'm still high oh yeah i see him he's running put a decent amount of lead on this one insert credit oh leg i can't oh he's lagging a little bit [Music] [Music] uh no i need to reload [Applause] yeah that's not a good idea if they survive they can redeploy oh no there's another guy oh no it's suddenly all gone downhill i think he's up on twin stills don't you know me disregard that oh okay yep top left twist or is it my interwebs you know what i mean yeah i know what you're saying i don't know what you mean but what you're saying that was very strange tom don't go there don't go these guys are crossing over here don't go to the attack you're not going to go there if you go back there you're dead uh magic watch should i go there [Applause] maybe oh it might be watched should i go there probably not okay tom this isn't hard this work i probably not gonna go there probably not it rest as well surprised nobody shot at me up here there's a truck here this is just one oh now somebody's shooting at me what he's down low somewhere shot at me that's crazy dude it's thomas that's so weird i don't know i'm gonna jump off con there's a full team there on orange

somewhere magic watch should we move standby of course give me the angle look at me it's like no well guess we're going down to that gasp i'm moving up dude i'm moving up off this all right i want my loadout back so yeah that'd be great no i'm gonna push towards blue i'm gonna buy a position that's right even after it said no i'm still like i'm still that guy pal you're not that guy you're not that guy pal trust me you're not that guy you're not that guy he says it like he's in a movie [Applause] yeah baby i'm down to my last bullet so yeah that wool hack thing gets quite annoying when it lights your entire player up gas moving now gas moving now gas moving now they're at a zone as well well just don't get just don't die [Applause] or you know what else i gotta down with the turret no no way no player damage at all it's the best it's so good when they're against the gas that's poor perk you don't have the damage at the m4 at that range it just doesn't work no no there's a team fight here stone island is under me somewhere are you using jack grenada or the commander one [Music] [Applause] we can use uh this one more here dude i don't know i don't know i'm crossing the road you're 40 seconds on that buy or there's one in the zone [Music] that's so crazy [Music] [Applause] got it go left stone position strike on there one head to our left knocked one of them to my left i made it inside i need a plate we're really like deep into the uh circle there weren't we it was good with the gas all the time it was decent it was bloody decent it was definitely uh internet like you having [ __ ] yeah it wasn't my internet coming out like therefore i had a really bad light around the same time you did oh mine was my internet there's storms around so i might lose my house in a second i don't know just american things you know it was a good game wasn't it i mean there was a couple a couple people there maybe more than i expected stream uh the fennec is hit scan after the update can you please try um yeah i was thinking about doing a video on the fennec or a live stream i'll um i'll think about it i'll i need to find a decent build though for the fennec i don't really know one go train station there is something regarding the event what's there just a weird guy something new uh southern reach thank you for the five imagine warzone with battlefield the evolution damage rooftop damage from airstrikes rpg dynamite wall damage yeah i'd be sick i'd love it if this uh if they build a new warzone map if it had destruction in it that'd be sick mohammed thank you for the nine and nicolas tran thank you for becoming a new member that's very kindly yeah it was right cole wasn't it unfortunately it's just one too many one too many people there yeah james we had a we had a cheater in the previous lobby a couple games ago but last few days there's not really been any thank you jayhawk hello from haiti what's up jan is this the modern warfare import yeah it is all right let's get this one let's do this yeah but as soon as you tag him once let's say you got a 200 round mag you start spraying through if all of us are screwed we just get a tag we all quattro beam somebody like you're going to lose a lot of ammo muni boxes yeah it's just how many boxes are we going to find we got four we can carry four pieces all of that guys out and more than on your position suggesting the content though think of the clip yeah i mean you know i tried to encourage you guys to use snapshot grenades yeah that was a terrible idea yeah but that's like a wall hack [Music] uh yeah that's fine reset it i don't know why that happens what happened on the content stone you messed up i had like 30 fps in that lobby if you i've had that before if you go to borderless and then alt tab tab back in and go full screen again it fixes it ruins yeah that usually fixes it for me wait go board list then what yeah if you go borderless click apply alt tab tab back into the game then go full screen apply if you ever get that 60fps bug right that figures it for me anyway interesting to try that have i seen what if on disney plus yeah i have i've seen the first episode anyway about uh captain carter it's very good i like things like that kind of mess with the the metaverse you know [Music] jack frank sounds like a smart older brother of winnie the pooh huh [Music] i don't think anyone has ever said that i sound like winnie the pooh before i mean winnie the pooh talks very slowly and who kind of talks like deuce like that's that's winnie the pooh you know do i i don't think maybe payne uh john thank you for the five euros do you think you'll still play as much warzone once 2042 drops um yeah because you know hopefully there'll be a new map new seasons i'll still play

is this a crazy inspect animation one no it's only with the barrel on it it gets like super cool what it's just like normally that's so dumb it should be the base thing the base gun that's what i would think i just hate money so i bought it anyway you hate money yeah my commission loves it yep i'm so nice [Applause] this has all been learned i think we have enough right yeah we haven't i'm trying to get over here to the base station [Music] get a 1v1 with a gondola delete it having the rest here come back in the center yeah this has all been looted too [Applause] we need plates not so

watching i like that that's a big brain well i went to get the truck [ __ ] and then run into an entire crash the truck off the cliff now [Applause] um i might take the gondola up to gondola i might uh actually i'm just going to get loot down here oh yeah where you get where you get in the loops don't just down here uh by the other base of the lift oh the glandular huh just the base of the just at the base of the lift yeah right there's literally nothing here yeah this is an absolutely chalk round it's absolutely like not even worth playing might as well just quit no it's all no come on honestly don't give up no no we can come back we can come back here we got this thing here we go i got cash can we come back and win this game come on can't wait to run you it's not my wife it feels like we're currently winning this game to me you know absolutely most likely winning feels like [Applause] we win this match it said most likely this has no drop on it even this far out i'm trying to like likely isn't yes but most likely is good send this chance you know yeah i can drive yeah you're not wrong you're in the jump pog i was thinking about it i was just trying to snipe some people far out yeah it feels like um jacqueline you want to go oh they're in atc all right yeah are they yeah tomlinson no tom please are you the way you went down i slowed down so you could take a shot at abc and then i realized the error of my weight there's a whole squad there there's no way i thought you're gonna take a shot you look like you were lined up ready to go and then i just tipped the vehicle and flipped it we could go stop at pd for ammo it's alright it was it was uh what it was one hp vehicles wouldn't be let's go with that oh there's an airport looking at me too it wasn't a brand new vehicle it's fine [Applause] do i do it tell me how to do it come on there's a whole spot in there do it it's gonna do the atc jump for the parachute most likely should i do it most likely most likely that's good percentage when you look low you're high it means you've got it right there is a full fully geared load you got it i'm getting it you're landing there natural up here snipers will watch you but i'm sure it'll be great good luck for glit he's got one he's got two i got two but then i got chokey i mean he said most likely it didn't say yes you know you mean [Applause] he went for it what's like [Music] [Music] put your zombie head down you won't hit it somebody's playing where this is wait can you guys ask me while you're there [Music] yeah we're good thank you good thing i spent all that time running around to try and get us a loadout [Applause] when do we get the next free up on five right it's on fire should i land into a schedule yeah we can do that we're gonna drive around atvs race [Applause] okay leave shot behind that sounds like a good idea oh there's people out there oh my god he knocked him he did it an atc i've got one of them the base savage oh god okay then we're down under the airport there okay thank you for the [ __ ] scav is super far away it's all right i'll do a little quick you know we'll pay my back [Music] i mean they have to leave now i'm flashed thank you guys can i get a rest run run run run run faster i'm seeing nothing stoned what are you doing i'm getting some loot dude i'm trying to get my don't go over here thomas i'm picking you up you can look quicker with the quad bike i just parachuted up here looking for cash we can go up here yellow marker time there's sometimes some loot oh that makes sense too two guys here jack frags man [Music] dragging out what's going on it wouldn't let me on they kept lagging me off this next compound was already looted oh yeah you want to check up here yeah it looks all right it looks clear i can hear crates yeah doing stairs maybe a little bit cash but cash break money cash nice pee pee up here i like that i mean we're getting there with the cash you know we're getting there we're getting there helicopter did you know that one stone huh no i didn't go down oh yeah i checked that one on the right it was all looted oh tactical spotters uh somebody got a crown there let's just fill center on this chump let's go let's go raise all right helicopter jack squad wipe them okay there's some cash on top here [Music] oh ow ow that really hurts i'm in danger i have a driving system too perfect i've seen this zone before and it does end up coming to us guaranteed hundred percent guaranteed hundred percent sick actually i don't even know that that's actually for so long we go try and kill that it's only let's go can you right in the open we're gonna get beam though what could go wrong we're so dead yep [Applause] oh no so we have to go for the quad plate i'm leaving i'm leaving you i'm sorry it's literally right in there there's a guy in there thug [Applause] this is adding years you're gonna have the other team coming out of the houses now on your left side left side of the building on the wall rather left side of the wall fog lit bro you got to be kidding me they had huge amount of cash dude huge catch huge cash get out of here [Music] okay this is my dudes tom you never know not there's people on the pool roof here you never know a ton of cash money please oh look at that stag voice oh my gosh yes 15k one by station left so take that vehicle and go like there's eight teams i am not getting a vehicle right now i don't want to do anything right now i just want to roll over my head 3 800 caches wolf you buy me back okay i i believe you can win this solo i don't think so established not that you need me i did drink a g-fuel before i started streaming tomorrow i didn't want to check the watch that time maybe service go on a cluster strike out of context doesn't really make sense [Applause] where did you come from [Applause] what did i just do to myself i can't believe he's killed me [Applause] you got one on your outside wall here tom live two there you guys can win this match come on let's go on the roof on the roof bro the quickscope broken get in front of it oh don't touch me stone mountain for the win here we go commando that was that was crazy wow movie come out in the uk what chiang chi legend of the 69 rings it's the legend of 69 okay isn't it how um it's out next next month isn't it start september i think so it got good reviews i know that i think sorry guys i gotta i gotta leave you on that smells really fun fun wow can't even say bye before top always like get out of here yeah boy nice meeting you jack yeah you said yesterday some of the best games i've had in a while crazy but true oh i just broke out with all of us uh try to leave party instead can we do a trio or is that choice yeah we can do trios oh yeah all right have fun guys see you later just thinking about the ping because it's uh [Music] send it with you maybe it'll work maybe it'll put us on easter eggs when we played uh we played with marley 13 and yeah i could slay man yeah i mean the ping actually worked worked to your advantage on that in that summit match yes you were hitting did not make any sense they weren't calculated yeah you know you're like this is great because if i shoot like they just walk into the bullet two seconds later yeah it was fun it's funny because like i would snipe i'd take the shot and then yeah it's like oh i missed oh yeah they catch up i got it i got it [Music] what's connor up to he's just uh he's kind of done with warzone until something happens until thursday when we find out that it might be world war ii for the new game he plays when something new happens yeah yeah he's off he's on apex now really yeah a little bit brilliant i think he wants to play a pixel yeah we were playing some ranked uh last week together i don't know if he's been playing it any anymore too but it's uh it's pretty good it's a different game it's all about the stuff it's very difficult about like you can't go to it that game expecting you know to just go crazy with kills yeah it's very different to warzone the third part there's probably like three [Music] actually would it be three even like the average kill cat in that game what about teamwork and positioning like kills of the afterthought surviving fights well like even in ranked you're capped at six kills for um points that you can get or assists right so you get like three kills three assists you don't get any other i don't know exactly how much it is but it's kills per rp up to six and then after six it doesn't matter anymore how much damage or kills you get then it's and then it's your placement right so you're not really incentivized to go out and kill the entire lobby you're really only incentivized to get you know some some action and then placement yeah you see that it's timmy guy the streamer that's the 54-hour stream or whatever the apex without sleeping solo queuing bro yeah what's impressive about that is the fact that they could like they kept their attention and skill like for 54 hours or whatever like how yeah at the at the 50 hour mark or whatever you got to play your craziest in order to you know you're fighting the best people at that point you're in like the top masters lobby because you go to masters and then you got to get the predator from there predators the top 750 people in the world yeah that's insane avoid the gas get to the safe zone if it was like if i only played apex and i only did apex content i'd grind the hell out of that game definitely yeah that would be the main thing to go for it is fun that you have rank to grind right like you've got something to show off and grind for and you get cool stuff you get the tr the prey trail holy wolves don't have that that'd be it'd be interesting to avoid something because some of these matches is just like why are we here yeah why are we still here why are we land bottom there was one there earlier today all right that's probably the latest i've ever pulled a parachute i still pulled it though that's a dub all right i hear lots of other things don't listen to the voices stone huh dinosaurs are the voices okay should we go up i don't know did anyone else land there i didn't see a red trail but i don't think they landed next to me [Applause] what's that purple skin called in the store it's uh i don't know if it'll be the first one you see at the top of the list dude that thing is ridiculous you don't want a jack you don't want it you don't want it i mean the guy did stick out like a sore thumb so exactly i want to be oh look at this dog i want to be him if anybody stream sniping they'll know it's you so that could be a good thing i'm ascending though jack i want to i want to see the dog stone come here dude what's that you seen this bulldog why dude there's a french bulldog right here i'm not kidding nah that's boring telling you man look at that it's a nice looking dog you know i saw i saw something about this apparently this dog is like all over this map really well different photos if you if you look at posters like calendars on walls and stuff you'll see this dog no this is i don't know why that's the case crazy dude this might be dude this might be the start of a new video right here all right we gotta keep an eye out for more of these dogs i swear i saw something about this it was like a month ago or so so i don't really remember i think it was this though maybe it was i think it was this does anyone speak russian what does that say i hear people by the way i hear people yeah they're coming to kill us quite clearly yeah it's okay he's got purple oh my god i broke one tom okay i'm coming down i'm finding someone else upstairs i feel sad about that yeah we're just admiring the dog man i mean come on look at the dogs hey we got some smart viewers man yeah left zone left you're up next i totally whiffed my second okay win here and you return to the front line you lose your fight [Applause] time to earn your freedom soldier [Applause] oh that was close nice where i die jack are down two uh they're getting pushed so i left that restaurant i went to buy store store in the buy but i didn't get them on the buyer because i didn't couldn't buy and then i died have you ever been as far as to even do more look like tom so what that's what it sounded like what you're saying today what was it you said in my tweet a while ago yeah i remember because i mean that thing again like um oh it's better to be halfway off the ladder no yeah you don't even know what it is can you drop on that i guess yeah we were playing warzone earlier in the day and you just couldn't remember what it was for about a minute someone in my chat just goes it's full of drunk oh good rest good breath thumbs where are they i think he broke his legs did you bring your legs up parachuting right on them i don't think i should have landed here no there's like three of them what are you doing well you didn't say anything i don't know what was happening i thought you broke through this in the feed you got down by like no i wasn't paying attention i was watching jack jesus christ this is another chalk round there's a door here there's a door take it stone take it yeah just get out of there see what you got to be outside the door that you want to open better than halfway through the door that you don't want to go through yeah exactly where's it gonna be you're crazy jack said it's better ladder climbing be in middle to the top then rather don't halfway inside the ladder before you climb along the halfway plane yeah that makes perfect sense and he says i'm drunk there's a bunch of fighting going on outside my building i'll drive oh there was a truck with a radio tower though you can ignore it yeah i wonder if it would be any good i was tempted to steal that oh he's right next to you my guy i didn't get it i don't think i got it advanced in there this is [Music] have i got any options here like what's the most wanted maybe where is it um oh there's something actually running next to you oh my god you can't just re-cue if you want i'm good to do whatever you guys want cable should we you want me to get a c okay all right yeah all right ask it tom should we abandon it should we abandon this match try again hold on right yeah should we abandon this match oh we don't see it it's like your calling card so i can't right oh let me get this load out and then i'll go for the most one if i die here just speak here yeah when he said downfall that means we win right there's anyone out here as well how are you liking the m4 it's you know if you hit the headshots it's good if you don't hit the headshots you just don't have the damage versus the accordion rivals that's crazy i can't believe they nerfed there as well i know why yeah that's like what are you doing man they're really just trying to get rid of all the modern warfare guns yeah because that was actually viable i'm gonna go this way bishop off the mag size to compensate give it a 40 round yeah that'd be good but they don't add new attachments for war zones or modern warfare guns do you think there'll be any any more warzone specific perks that they had maybe there's a few that they could mess around with i'm going to be added are actually pretty decent what else would you want um one that every time every time like you get cocky and push a squad and you lie down a couple of them but die as you die it should say you're not that guy pal do you think people would take that perk over yeah can that be you ghost maybe yeah maybe a perk one slot okay interesting or maybe they just have a fourth floor dedicated to that what about a parkway if you got in a vehicle it had like 25 more health i mean is that the same issue as giving it's a jailbreak so what what's the point of me then you know what i mean now what's the point how about a perk to counter ghosts so let's say you take a perk that lets you see ghosted players in the middle slot on heartbeat censoring you ever can that be a good one i don't know because some players are like it's too much of a counter to a perk directly yeah but they have that now don't know i mean like cold-blooded that's a direct counter to the new one you're hiding something it's not like revealing you should we try and get over to our loadout it's just a complete waste of a perk if you put a ghost on it has no benefit whatsoever yeah but someone would have to take you can try [Applause] people would have to be taking that counterpart there wouldn't they [Applause] not everyone would take that just like not everyone picks ghosts or [Applause] i'll just fight in there this hasn't been looted at all this whole place so there's a guy right under us tom no way right behind us right behind us don't die where we're coming from [Applause] far left on heartbeat far left on green but he went left [Applause] [Applause] it's team serious teams here dip in allied cluster strike inbound clustered us keep crawling good cluster there's a couple of them now he runs his team okay brought his own here yep get back i'm gonna try and come over to you guys if i can rp check went off to our right here somewhere i'll drive okay i'm moving they can brief temporarily we're not in zone here it's closing yeah damn it somewhere dude i got i've got money i can buy you back what about a perk that let you shoot your pistol when you were down is that worth it i don't know about that oh yeah i don't know about that one i'd just be annoying that's last man's standard yeah it's an old cod work yeah i don't know if it would be that power or as an actual perk i can buy a loadout i'm gonna buy a loadout so you're dropping me hell yeah you have more like health for like 20 seconds when you come back another one on the hill here i can't get an angle he hit me oh he's at the trees got it good [ __ ] in chief another one top hill another one top hill different team no eyes oh yeah down down hit nine nine nice i'm gonna give this guy stuff down here that i killed is satchel i'm gonna play stone at me yeah yeah i can drop i can drop some where are you okay you're going right i'm just trying to get a bit safer yeah because the zone's coming tom what are you doing i i survived the engagement stone didn't and i'm lying out downtown trying to get over the hill there's a team in front of me hospital oh i'm dead dude how did he kill me so fast it's the purple dude yeah grumpy kitten he's got beams he's got beams he's using the m2 irons irons you know the iron scope thing whatever it is oh yeah the default scope enemies head shot [Music] [Applause] [Music] 11 he kills had zero recoil and just locked onto my head [Applause] default emblem new account spent some money though on that skin [Applause] second year today [Music] yeah and how many hours uh less than three [Music] happiest days that skin is ridiculous up there what the hell it is i don't realize there's a trail all of the time [Music] maybe it's more profound when you're in a car or something look at this just lock it on yeah it's just locking on them through the pole gets uh still locking on through the pole too there that was nice [Applause] perfect shots right on as he goes through the cross there's cracked [Applause] honestly you should try out some sort of team it seems suspicious of somebody in the second game come on dude straight yeah great guess no uav required very good and that guy's ghosted in there too his suspicions were created going for a little contract completion here he's 13 kd apparently it's not this match yeah let's see him get banned alive let's go let's go let's go you see they updated the kill feed so it says it now really oh really yeah so if someone gets banned in your match you'll say on the left side there whatever name have been banned when does it pop up where the kill feed is of course says someone has left the game i've never gotten a notification saying that somebody i reported i think it's brand new then if i've not i've never seen that oh yeah yeah with with this season new thing they've added to the kill feed okay a little more zone tweeted about it great prediction on the second floor there it was a great prediction this is a big [ __ ] oh wow look at that tracking dude sick oh they've been stunned though hello come on guys oh he's he gets knocked he's got to sell fresh though he's got 30 grand i don't need to go he's going to go down [Applause] need to plate there is this the guy that killed us at the start in nakatomi yeah yeah yeah yeah cool cool sick nice sweet oh no i actually killed him right but his squad killed us i got killed by him i don't know what oh but the teammate knows where he is now because he's just been scanned gotta [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he bought the whole battle pass though together maybe he he probably he probably legit got through this whole battle pass no problem he's so good dead quick as well super fast can you report someone as if like say someone's watching the streams right now yeah can they enter his name somewhere to report that's what i know of what do you mean you go to like a website no i don't think so didn't they um i think they did this once for like nick marks and courage and tim they actually banned this uh a cheetah live [Applause] i think i think they messaged raven though yeah with dm raven i don't think anyone at raven will be watching us we're just not big enough they don't care about us uh you're that guy jack you got a creator coach yeah yeah yeah you've got chris yeah yeah all right get my speed down man yeah i'm on the white list as well right yeah yeah there you go hold on let me just text raven beep we need a band over here mom we find grumpy kid see the genie this is the genie thing the genie he's got the genie aka oh wow what a gamer destination right on to the next target too he's got he's got an obsidian sniper report he probably just unlocked everything yeah that's it that unlocked everything in the game no they do stuff yeah they legit do have that there's no way yeah okay oh the tank down oh it's ufc bro it's ufc [Music] there we go he's on a 22 bomb right now four other teams three suns over the top pb it's the snipe one for the city sniper yeah doesn't even have it built for a nice ads it doesn't need it always caught outside zone this guy it's screwing him oh oh and he has to reach a bird he's not ready he's chewing before the gun's even ready yeah he's just that good time he can do that yeah he's really on it he knows what he's doing what's this okay right he's seeing where the bullets come from he's going to pre-fire this because he's a good player oh the double kill use the trail there to figure out where they were [Applause] oh my god disgusting how did they get this good piece no way no way does this hit prediction chase imagine [Applause] please get beamed he knocked two in this house but he never got a finish off it oh he's just trying to shoot out over there that direction spectators now ten spectators oh man i really hope everybody's reporting them right now there's a dude right there with the tracklist come on get him banned alive come on [Applause] oh oh we missed raven if you're out there good somebody oh somebody shut this man down 28 kills

knocked up they got it he's letting the teammates win it [Applause] i could have got a 30 bomb too i hate everything about that here we are man here we are here we are right i'm going to end it there boys that was really good fun yeah enjoyed it oh okay hey gg's got some good games there yeah brilliant how many was it two or three one two uh that sounds all right but the games are still good yeah yeah we had fun amazing it's a really nice theory as well good player right have a good night guys love you lot love you too jack catcher man bye boys and girls watching the stream thank you for tuning in i hope you enjoyed that although it was soured a bit by uh cheer at the end there but you know that's warzone for you that's what you get um but the whole point of this was to ascertain is the m4 still relevant i think against most cold war assault rifles like em2 c58 farah trying to think what else would fall into that bracket qbz you know it doesn't quite cut the mustard at range but at close range close to medium if you hit the headshots it's uh it's still pretty good i don't think it's going to be meta again but the m4 is a classic isn't it and you gotta love it because it's got so many of those og modern warfare vibes it's a good one anyway ladies and gents thank you so much for watching the stream we did have a couple more subs at the end and donations as well pingu wick
