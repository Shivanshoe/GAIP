guys welcome to battlefield 2042 this is patch 4.0 and i haven't really had much of a chance to play today because i was playing star citizen all day so you know it's a bit later in the day it's better late than never eh you may notice a few things that are different first off let me just show you a couple things in the options here i have voiceover ips in the game now though i've got it turned off just for the sake of clean commentary they've changed the hood here so now you know what's on or off you don't get that weird mensa quiz every time you pick something different and there's some extra options here in the hood as well you can scale all this stuff on the hood and i put mine down to 80 and that's basically like the size of the mini map the icons for the players the vehicle icons that kind of stuff you can set this to automatically be off the chat and i think that's new as well you can turn the soldier compass on and off or just ads only quite a few options there in the menu and the mouse does feel more responsive if you've been on social media today or looking at reddit you may have seen people talking about this because there were a lot of changes in this patch that weren't in the patch notes and the input lag is kind of gone now if you're a pc player you wouldn't notice this definitely but it just felt a bit sluggish to turn your camera around but now it's it's nice it feels good also i am getting about 10 to 15 more frames per second on average than i was with the previous build of the game so it looks like there's been some performance increases which is good to hear the gun play has actually changed as well there's someone soft flaming that so the attachments are all different now and you can see what they change on the left there i think some of the sights actually affect the aim down the side speed now as well i haven't really looked into that at all really i just boot it up so i'm just gonna play and see how it feels i can immediately tell though that the mouse is just a lot better but i need to get in a fight here all i've done is destroy a bolty they haven't made the change to that yet in terms of moving it to the attack vehicles i think that's coming soon but they have put the little bird into the attack helicopter category and i think they've reduced the number of helicopters so there should just be fewer of those in the game now so hopefully you won't be done by helicopters all the time you can actually latch onto vehicles with this now and do a spider-man thing so if i get some rocket launcher back or some c5 maybe i can attempt to do some spider-man kills where you you know grab onto a helicopter and follow it kind of pulls you along i've seen a couple clips of it so i'm looking forward to testing that out this is pretty cool as well when you select your gun you can see what your squad mates have so someone else in my squad has got the ak one of them he's got the mp9 just a little hood update there i think it's a bit too high they all jumped out i mean i can tell right away that feels different like it feels like there's a lot more recall on that god i'm dead i think the angel thing is different too as well like they've changed the way that looks see so it's just not a really confusing four squares thing you can actually see the load out there which is good just bailed out how's it going is it dead i want to try and grapple it i think you're going to be seeing a lot more of those as well because they've been buffed more transport vehicles not necessarily a bad thing in terms of battlefield [Music] gamepl ow ow please think about the children again come on around 60 meters i don't think they're going to spot me here come on that gun feels way different long range tank kill 200 meters let's go oh i'm out whoa someone blew that there hello look at that apparently this is quite realistic this is just what happens to tanks i feel like there's some new sounds as well i'm sure that i've heard some new sounds so far this stuff is still here oh wait oh my god it doesn't ruin you they've actually taken away the pain effect okay i like that hopefully it's like that and all the other matters agree i'm gonna have to get used to this gunplay again or figure out some different attachments maybe i think there was one right there wasn't it get one more kill before the round ends come on we can do it no where'd they go well that's round one over this battle is one play another one see how it goes is this new coming in on a helicopter that was either new or it was just better than usual i'm not sure i felt like it was better than usual oh yeah i forgot to show you the opacity as well didn't i her general hold icons here we go so you can change all the opacity as well now so if you feel like things get in the way you can scale it all hello what weapon is this dm7 i don't want that the dmrs are pretty crap aren't they unless they've been buffed in this update i don't know i don't think they have i can hear a car or something it did actually stop when i asked it to it's an obedient bolty it's nice having that bit of extra space on the screen though and i could make it a lot smaller than that if i wanted to and i can't wait till they change this map and that's got so much more initial recall on it than it used to have wow okay that's nuts maybe they've got it built in a different way or something i've got there finally how about that get a little flank on the go here a grenade down there yeah that's a lot more recoil wow balti ah it's supposed to be easy to hit these now as well oh okay maybe it was maybe it was wait the prone helps maybe with that not sure crouching can we stop shooting at me please that's not cool i've got to try the sundance grenades out as well at some point because they're supposed to be fixed now as well like you can actually use them and throw them at things near you if i go like this hello hello oh god behind me no i missed so many shots then [Music] that's a new sound when you request the revive hear that cheeky little ping there okay i'll try a different gun should we use the scar why not it was absolutely trash but we'll see may have changed now okay good job guys you've killed them all well that's that mckay i think i have that but i've never actually tried it oh you're an enemy quite punchy there i love that doesn't this have a it does it has a grenade launcher on it reloading such a shame that you can't destroy things like that come on there's glass there what the ranger parachute is that new i've never seen that before let's even get towards c oh that helicopter hello still didn't sound as good as the one from porthole though did it look at this what's go it's war i mean it's a hit and i've run out what is this helicopter doing this hindi you're gonna get yourself killed buddy what is going on [Music] a mess hang on i put a grenade in somewhere second all right what are we doing why are these helicopters like flying solo to the ground what's happening here another grenade oh direct hit wasn't a kill with a grenade are you kidding there's six people here oh they're gonna be upstairs aren't they let's go maria oh they're all there if they're all there oh yeah i got revealed then because i hit a page yes double kill why were we location revealed then oh there's one more there dead everyone's dead guys everyone's dead okay that's not bad maybe that's the range that kind of medium range is perfect for it i need some meds please maria maria please grenade about there that's the play whoa yeah grenade got a kill very nice excuse me sir are you okay sir what was going on there yeah way more recall it's getting a bit chaotic here i don't like it is that a wild cat what is that ow it's something wait i wasn't damaging that was i was like damaging the ranger maybe could have been get him lads i need more rockets damn it no one drops ammo we need like little ammo stations around or something i might try playing as sundance for a bit and just see what those grenades are like let's take the pp as well hey see how that does there's always snipers up here isn't that snipers oh god i almost died they have complete control of echo sector not one okay maybe that's not a range they know if the range on it or something yeah so apparently those grenades will actually like stay on the ground for a while and then if there's a if there's a target that comes up they'll kind of launch and take after it that's what it said in the patch notes anyway and even the pb feels a bit different okay let's try that is that gonna lock on no too far away i'm gonna have to figure out that distance because it seems like it's been nerfed loads friendly down oh it's the same guy i'm coming just chill i'm here to help i don't think that's changed the speed of that there's definitely some new icons there all right let's go across hey joel does it again another one on the left let's go i saw him good thing anyway thank you why was i spotted then what happened why did i get spied i'm confused they returned the favor look at that try this little bird oh god the tracer effect on that looks a bit different to me i'm trying to take this thing down i want to kill it there we go we got it let's go for this osprey although there's a wild cat down there careful i've got it i've got it i got it come on that was a really unfortunate place for them to go down there whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what is what was that dude that balti firing those front facing rockets love that these guys are here 200. check out that ranger should be a one-hit kill yeah it is that's a nice change as well so you can take out the ranges easier is that close enough yeah that is come on come on come on come on did i hit it then and it wasn't a kill and i'm out rockets damn it damn you toho oh you're responsible for something gamer now you're dead i really need to just throw one of these at a vehicle that's close to me so you've really got to think a bit more about using those now by the looks of it i got behind a load of people here all right not so much recall on that angel stop doing it again you'll never do it again ever i can't wait till they remove or change those voice lines it's coming man i know it is location revealed why wait that guy have a blue icon above their head and then it changed or am i just being stupid i can hear people is that a ball to you there come on quick work yes it's gonna work please kill we've got the destroyer but they jumped out i feel like it's gonna make that mastery for sundance a bit easier right dead guy here maybe that's why i'm being spied those little sensible things let's get a flank here's five people here somewhere on the roof maybe might be someone down there they remove some stuff from up here i feel like they have there's another guy there angel has exploded again oh i'm gone bit more difficult to control that as well i would say over here this feels different you know the wingsuit that doesn't feel as responsive someone was drilling me in the back there i'm going to switch back to mckay because i want to try and do the thing because i promised you i'll try and do the thing and i haven't really had an opportunity i think maybe on the south korean map that'd be a good place to do it the rocket i mean i haven't really come across any bugs yet which is good all right i like that the whole experience feels smooth in a good way that's a wildcat our forces are assaulting alcohol uh pain pain no unless you can give me ammo is it gone behind it it's gonna come back and we'll go this way hit it again i'm gonna need some ammo angel angel can you drop the thing get over there oh no it's nearly dead look at his health there we go good job angel how do you can you drop the thing drop the thing now drop the thing the thing got the thing the box fox drop the box the box i shouldn't return voiceover ip off please drop the box you've got the box do you not have the box i don't think he's got the box surely everyone just gets the box the box box box dot the box no maybe they don't have the charm that's fine ten tickets we're gonna lose damn it okay the long range pp long range pp kill yes right before the end of the game thank you very much there it is you know what pretty flawless experience there on both maps i enjoyed that it's a good start in it feels like this is how the game should have launched now give us content dice please oh yeah you can see the scoreboard at the end as well this is
