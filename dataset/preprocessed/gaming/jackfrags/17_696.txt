hi everyone hope you're doing well today we got a massive patch for call of duty war zone and actually changed a few things in the game so instead of just reading off the news with random gameplay in the background I thought that I would try and play a solo match and I've got some of the most important changes and updates on my other monitor so I'll go through those as I'm playing doing live commentary and we'll just see how well we can do so it should be good fun and I think that some of this stuff starts to fundamentally change the meta of warzone in certain ways without said I am gonna use a different loadout today I've gone with a new m4 build which is this one here I don't typically use the m4 that much because I feel like it's just a bit obvious but today I thought why not also with the new gunsmith you can actually add parts and mix-and-match pieces of blueprints say the barrel from kingly splendor there so you can make some really interesting looking guns so got the mono suppressor the stock m16 Grenadier I put an optic on which I don't usually do but I want to try and play more out in the open in this match and engage people at longer distances so about that got the commander for grip and then the sixty round mag so with that said we're gonna get into a game and see how we fare by yes so the coolest thing that I should do is get to a scavenger contract because they've added a armored satchel which is a new pickup I suppose that you can have in your inventory and if you get it it will let you carry eight on the plate so the default is 5 if you get this one you can carry 8 and it's a guaranteed drug if you complete a scavenger contract so that's what we're gonna do all right this should be the final box here and as long as no one's around which I don't think they are there it is now if you look at my inventory at the bottom there it's like a whole new icon and everything and I should be able to put 7 more plates in that but what's interesting is that if I die or if I kill someone and they have one of those they'll drop it and I could pick it up I didn't already have one kind of weird but I'm I'm noticing like less money in cranks I don't know if they've changed anything with that bird I'm not seeing like as much money in the crates anymore maybe that's maybe one just being unlucky but it wasn't anything about that in the patch notes I'm gonna get my load out here provided that there's no one around now one of the other things that I wanted to talk about pretty early on was that this patch may be useful this patch didn't have any weapon changes in it and I know a lot of people have been asking for a change to the snake shot revolvers and the RPG but there wasn't anything in the patch and a lot of people like complained about that on Reddit and Twitter and we actually had Josie cot who was one of the devs working on the game and he tweeted there's gonna be some changes for the snake shot in a smaller update coming soon and RPGs are also gonna get a tuning fast in the next big update to come late down the line so it looks like they are aware of how ridiculous those snake shots are and of course the RPG spam is is getting a bit crazy now so yeah he just wanted to let people know that that is in the works I suppose they've adjusted the speed of the circle too and they did not specify exactly what that meant but a couple of people on ready I was reading I've done some testing and the too long didn't read was that the gas like closes slower now which will allow you to kind of outpace it and outrun it and the initial circle moves sooner did I just see someone there yeah I did funny we were talking about RPG spam I kill just way too easy there oh yeah apparently gas moves in a bit sooner now but it closes slower so you can outrun it I think that's the gist of it you know I think I'm gonna get my sniper for this game instead of the RPG that HDR I'm gonna aim for Mac given it it's really difficult to select which weapon you want still on the ground I think they need to work on the lose still because it's a bit messy sometimes you can hear someone shooting over there but I can't see him just trying to look for the tracers no mind something else that I saw on Reddit girl was there how's it going this tower hold on and wait for this dude to stand still there we go I don't know how that first shot missed it looked like it was right on him but something else that I saw I read it was someone found a red access card in a orange legendary crate and they think that this might be something to do with the vaults or the yeah it was a sniper up there they think that it might be something to do with the vaults or the laptop like if you picked that card up and then you like try and access one of the laptops or one of the doors it might actually let you in so I'm definitely gonna be looking out for that but while I'm here this might be the perfect opportunity the perfect segue to talk about the new contract and the new bounty contract in squads and it's called most-wanted and it's a new contract it's kind of interesting too because when you pick it up instead of it giving you a target to look for instead you're volunteering to put a bounty on yourself for any squad in the whole of the game and if you manage to survive you get a load of money and so all your teammates are revived right and killed that one guy yeah so if you complete that bounty if you complete that bounty and survive you get some cash and if your teammates are dead let's say you're playing quads it's just you alive you pick up the contract you don't have money or something to respawn your teammates if you survive that contract all of your teammates will automatically redeploy it's kind of cool sort of like the ultimate risk reward thing that could be like a massive comeback if you pull it off and if you were just paying attention then in that fight the truck is back in the game big chunk is back in solos but they've reduced the turning speed the acceleration and top speed so he's a bit slower that should have been a down so I'll be interesting to see how dangerous the truck is again I've not tried it yet so I don't know man he just ran into that one good man is there anyone else come in this way I don't know I'm just gonna wait here a sec one thing that I haven't mentioned yet as well is that you can drop your weapons now but I don't want to show it right now cuz I wanted to win this match there's only 14 players left but what I'll do is I'll just put a clipping at the end of the video just to show you what that's like but pretty cool that you could do that now if your teammate needed a gun or something oh you picked one up accidentally and I think that's the most important stuff that I wrote down so now I'm gonna try and focus up and actually win this match oh man that guy didn't stand a chance this m4 though quite spicy with this build you know I'm liking it now usually I find it quite difficult to engage people at longer ranges when you've just got the iron sights because obviously they have massive benefits but um yeah it's quite nice being able to shoot people at longer ranges and still be accurate something going down there he's a man for the strike on him he's gonna make his armor again I don't know what's behind there right this guy must have one of those satchels you know cuz I broke his arm twice and he's got on run again so that's at least what four or five plates maybe I'm gonna hold him no cuz he has to come to me now that was a lot messier than I'd like it to be but I think I should be able to get around here I do have a gas mask so I'm not gonna make any coughing noises I don't like this because I'm come in late you really should've killed him my friend I was about to say I'm coming in late to the zone and I don't like coming in late to the zones because you don't really have a lay of the land like you haven't heard anyone you don't know where people have been fighting or anything but I think I've got a bit lucky there cuz that dude maybe you should have ghosted me a bit and just drop over okay I'm just gonna stealth my way in I'm really worried about this right-hand side though they've got the high advantage up there too and do you have these big rocks that I can use as cover but I'm not seeing these two other people I'm seeing them now they both unsuppressed I reckon I can take this guy on the right there won't be one he's over there somewhere but I don't know exactly where this dude is maybe there's someone okay that one's actually quite chill you know usually solos you're a lot more intense than that but that was good fun and I think we covered off everything that I wanted to talk about as well but there we go I hope you guys enjoyed that bit of a weird form I know how many kills did we get then was it at 11:10 something like that Gigi though but yeah I'll have to show you a clip of what the drop in the weapons looks like now so I'm just gonna go and record that and then you'll see that now right so steady Z on PC just open the inventory in there middle mouse and it drops the gun now you can pick it back up if you want and I think on PlayStation 4 it's down on the d-pad or square and then on Xbox it's down on the d-pad or X and I'll do the same job anyway guys that's all for today I hope you enjoyed it
