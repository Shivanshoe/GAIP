this was my first ever time using a sniper rifle in hell let loose if you haven't played the game it's 50 versus 50 and only two players on each team can use a sniper rifle they're allowed one other person in their squad as a spotter so there's only four sniper rifles in play at any time on a server if you've played hell let loose you'll know how fun it can be and also how hide the damages the ttk in this game is incredibly realistic usually it's just one or two bullets and you'll go down but having never experienced using a sniper rifle in this game before I didn't know exactly how powerful they were but in this match I'm playing on the access side with Tommy and Adam Tommy spotting for me and as we are on the access side were attempting to take a couple of the allies strategic positions and push them back it was really fun and we had some great mums in here if you enjoyed the video leave a like and subscribe for more let's do this guy gets that bunker there over here tom
