look at this gun what kind of game is this sci-fi game modern warfare game no one knows anymore but this is based off a real gun called the hk g11 they've just added this to black ops cold war that means that it's also now available in warzone and they've got this blueprint for it that kind of looks like a sci-fi weapon reminds me a bit of the ghost rifle do you remember that from battlefield 4 the railgun that thing was awesome and then they nerfed it into oblivion and then it was kind of useless but it's in warzone now so i thought that we'd check it out today i haven't unlocked it yet to unlock this you have to get two kills in rapid succession with tactical rifles in 10 different matches and that's gonna take a while to unlock that in warzone and i don't really want to play cold war at the moment so i might just let this one unlock naturally but there is a blueprint for it i bought it here if you guys decide to pick it up use my creator code in the store jack frags and caps thank you great way to help support me it's going has been in a couple movies as well i think it was in demolition man back in the day do you remember that wesley snipes just kicking us but it was developed from the late 1960s to the early 90s so it does make sense that it would be in black ops cold war it's actually a non-production rifle too but it does look cool so it makes sense that they would put it in video games right i can't recommend any builds for it at the moment because as i said i haven't unlocked it so i can't stop customizing it so the gameplay that you're seeing here and in the game later on he's just with the default blueprint it's not the best attachments jacob did a video on it maxed it out yesterday broke down all the stats on it and everything and it looks like the practical time to kill is around 540. which isn't insane but it's not bad at the same time but you can get a ttk of 435 if you just hit headshots so you get that quick two burst kill if your aim's good if you're close enough you could down someone theoretically incredibly fast with this i don't think it's going to be overpowered but it is fun and it's just interesting to look at in game because it's so different there's a couple of nice reticles that you can get for it too that make it look like a gun from destiny but i've only seen those having unlocked them yet with that said there's a little game that i've got here for you on rebirth unfortunately they took away resurgence on the dance in the update yesterday will it come back next week maybe i think it was beginning to grow in popularity just because the mid game doesn't really slow down because you've always got people coming back and a lot of people were quite vocal about them taking that away from the dance because it it's fun but with that said guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like thank you and let me know if you've used this gun what your thoughts on it are as always thank you for watching guys enjoy i want to see us all with one kill each by the end of the game [Music] i've been headquarters again yeah yeah yeah there is nowhere else to go guns guns guns guns guns guns kind of hoping that strike candy i've already
