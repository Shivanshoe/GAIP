okay i've got to lead this alien into the trap here come on alien hey there oh and now what turn on the track okay did you say we have to do that what trap oh god i think this isn't here is it done dude 14 hp welcome to rainbow six extraction i was recently invited to play and record this new game from ubisoft and a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video it's a one to three player co-op experience with some of your favorite rainbow six operators leading them on missions into containment zones to fight an alien threat known as the archaeans and these are a more evolved form of the parasite originally found in mexico with operation chimera so in this game you play together to complete missions and objectives and some abilities gadgets and tech will feel familiar if you're a rainbow six siege player but as you progress you will unlock new upgrades and a new arsenal of react tech to take on the threat each level that you go into has three sub maps to fight through with an option to extract to any point to bank any rewards but the further you go the higher the difficulty gets and if your operator falls in battle you'll go into the missing in action mode and you won't be able to play as that operator again until they're recovered and extracted from the map so there's an element of a meta game here which is cool there are multiple types of archaeans to fight here too with different stats and abilities adding variety every time that you play and the objectives that you're given are also randomized we will show on 12 objectives from capturing areas luring specimens into traps and stealthy emissions like sneaking and planting trackers on nests without being detected so today i'm going to show you some highlights from one of our first ever matches playing here with talia mar and core ross i hope you guys enjoy this if you do hit that like button thank you and if you're interested in taking a look at the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below so with that said let's get into the action now and see if we made it out alive okay this one is take down the target that's more our [Music] yeah i might need to stun him and get behind him there we go there's one sample okay there's another dude over here yeah there's one over here as well a smoke and get behind it okay i've got the second one hi yep yeah i'll come over to you guys oh i just jumped down the whole south stairs i love that for me you should be getting from behind if you can get up there oh my god i just started a drone i don't know what then get it well done okay good acquisition that's a way better start than last time oh my god they just vomit aliens out of the walls all right my ability found nothing that time yeah i think we have to go to the next section now right maybe this one over here oh my goo so if i interact with that your approach so far is working keep at it your main objective is to rescue our downed operator oh okay oh we'll get him this time got a safe sledge and bring it back home so he can keep hammering all the things oh he's over there yeah i've seen your heartbeat sensor finally that was kind of cool one of us has to try and grab him out i'll do that because you guys probably have more of a chance of doing the hard bits so i'm just going to hold on to this guy okay oh there's a guy right here oh my god are they awful now the archery won't let go i'm pulling necessary come on friend we've got to shoot all these red things here oh no no no no oh my god sounds closed is it getting easier now tyler is it still no there's still the things that are attached to him all of these red things needs to be destroyed he's like i lines see them from down here i'm going to go at the top i'm doing a couple at the bottom there we go there's a few nice there's one near me at the top oh there's a three up top near me [Music] yeah i got i got two of the ones up top there's one more up here one down here that's gone oh i need to move i'm in oh i've got three hp there's one right at the top there ross i can't see it yeah i got the top one go for another one someone's dead oh oh yeah yeah wait it's over here one here there we go yes we got a nice he's out he's out there i have three hp and a dream oh god oh no watch out watch out we gotta put him in the coffin at the chopper there's so many bad guys over there should we go up the stairs this way maybe is this i'll grab that i hope we can get upstairs this way extraction things over here open that yeah i think if you come out here mm-hmm good job with these eggs up the stairs here maybe it's quite satisfying shooting that stuff it actually really is the way it disperses oh oh no i can't get it he sees me i'm dead watch out for those spikers so we continue on with the mission i mean he went through extremely low health will we find hills in the next airlock maybe i don't know well what do you guys want to do i'll do whatever i'm going to go to the airlock yeah let's just give it a go okay we might not even get there yeah i mean i feel like you guys might okay i don't actually see any heels oh no there are no hills in here oh no uh we're ruined i mean we might get an easy objective i don't know it's fine right it's fine yeah i reckon it'll be all right well we can always have a look at it and we can always evac from the new zone as well you will collect data on parasite energy phenomena as they react to the catalyst okay there's a donnie right here and i'm not sure about any looks a little sass one shot kill make sure we get all these nests nesting here we've gotta find the catalyst emitter it's gonna be in here isn't it yeah oh there's more ghosty boys again do you ever find anything useful grossly lads around yeah there's a big red nest over here they put mines down what no all right starting this gun head to the first one where this gas was coming from go down the stairs hostile there's a nice long corridor here that could be a good place to hold beautiful what the hell is that oh my god put it down oh i need to get up no bro that guy did not want to die horrible gordon yhp is making this a lot more a bit stressful oh he made that no someone just don't know where he came from all right we're coming to you ross here yeah i'd reach this area to scan it get rid of all this goo i'm dangerously low enough oh no this is an awful room to fight in yeah there's a bunch of doors if you want to try closing them down no i got you oh this is going to be an absolute nightmare thank you yep yeah oh oh no no no no no yeah i'm dead oh no no no no i just got a flashbang what the hell and these things do not mess around i'm dead 57 hp 14 seconds grab a couple smoke grenades at the vulva i don't think i can get to it in time i don't know we missed our chance why did we fail that then did they just like overrun it we got to have someone in the zone all the time otherwise it starts to go down after you you're away for too long what it's like oh my god i don't see a thing oh he got me we've all been phone guys uh feels bad man all operators down it did that was intense so there we go guys i hope you enjoyed that the difficulty really does ramp up the further you go into the level but of course the rewards are better if you can manage to extract and you've got to be very careful with your health and ammo management too with that said let me know your thoughts on the game down in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe for more and i'll see you in the
