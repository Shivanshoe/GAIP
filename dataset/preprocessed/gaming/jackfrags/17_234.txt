hello everyone and welcome to medal of honor war fighter i thought that we would play through the campaign it's something that i've never done before i think perhaps i played the first mission and that was that and i just wanted to experience it the whole thing's about three and a half to four hours long does it hold up today and the interesting thing about this is that this game came out in 2012 year after battlefield 3. so this is on frostbite engine 2 and it's the same engine that bf3 used so it should still look pretty good because you know you go back and play bf3 still holds up but i'm looking forward to this gonna be a pretty chill walkthrough if you're watching this live hello welcome thank you for coming along and if you enjoy it hit that like button if you're watching this as a vod do the same that's a great way to help support me have you got any questions in the chat hit me up let me know in the comments and let's get into this i'm looking forward to this so i just checked it earlier make sure it was running okay and it it seemed to run fine on my computer so we'll give it a shot medal of honor warfighter let's do it and the multiplayer of this did some really interesting things it wasn't amazing but the body system the gun customization too was really special let's get into this eight weeks ago preacher i think this follows on from the story of the 2010 game they did i don't remember much about that though pretty operated dudes right there now we're moving in [Music] friendlies here take him out there's our truck don't shoot the guard in the office let's go with those headshots you got your six oh i'm gonna blow this truck's still too close do it preacher boom whoa what the [ __ ] oh my god get down [Music] our six is cut off i nearly shot you mate i'm sorry but that guy's it's called mother it still looks pretty good [Music] um what he's just walking around with his head on fire how about you go through the container hey i can drop my weapons hello it's like i've been stunned it was a oh my god that's a big bang it does look really good guys doesn't it still ea presents andrew thank you very much for the 100 very kind you man yeah i've not played with this campaign so i'm looking forward to it yeah and thank you for becoming a member 16 months man crazy you can do that now by the way on youtube streams you can say how long you've been a member of how this works you make a million promises get bella's hopes up we start making plans and then you start taking calls in the other room and you disappear this isn't that casual push-ups no big deal why did you hang up on me i'm driving there's a tunnel you're driving and talking is she in the car i'm not driving who's driving my dad next question i'm sorry sorry sorry always sorry i don't want to fight you live for it mother dusty what the hell just happened with your little off no idea standard demolition stuff next thing we know it's raining containers and we're in a shootout with a goddamn helicopter we're pretty certain it wasn't the harbor patrol no it wasn't singing hits are lighting up from manila to east africa piss somebody off of that fireworks show any ideas who that's a pretty long list brother what do you say you do oga a favor and stick around that port so you can whittle that list down this is outside the navy's wheelhouse dusty we need approval from pretty high up got it all ready of course you did what are your local assets telling you we had a guy code named ardress deep in a cell on the arabian peninsula you had a guy no we haven't heard from him in months this was scary he could be dead could be flipped he could be anywhere he's not flipped or dead come on let's be honest argus that's a weird word isn't it what does that mean let's see bro what's up bro here captain hey anatoly welcome to the stream guys thank you [Music] do you guys think it looks better or worse than bf3 so far in terms of the realistic graphics so i'm the undercover guy i think little master toggle scope when zoomed in [Music] there's the body system get behind the cover dude we're training you're not supposed to kill me [Music] let's go [Music] see how quick we can do it i presume the blue ones are hostages [Music] oh i missed the shot oh i gotta jump over that nice come on we talked about this he's peeping out his little head move oh we got to breach it here we go oh this is part of the game isn't it you get different options get ready for the slo-mo okay i wonder what the world record time is for that do you think someone's posted it on youtube what kind of charges you use shaped just enough to destroy the truck and look like a faulty gas line that secondary wasn't us no it wasn't blast pattern's different and it came from inside the container this confirms our theory about explosive shipments yeah any idea who's that [ __ ] shell company dubai lots of traffic between there karachi the philippines that cell phone you got some big help look i gotta ask are you doing i'll be fine about to get their feet wet yeah it's be all at the moment let's keep in touch brother let's be off before it was out if i don't make it it looks a bit like stone mine that does what the hell that's all she gets that stunning man is a lot more handsome than that stefan thanks for the five stop will they ever bring back this series i don't know monster i think maybe it's due for a reboot i don't know who would do it though you'd have to get a good studio to do it and also battlefield is the modern shooter now world war ii has kind of been done so uh andrew thanks again for the ten check out medal on the rising sun finest hour and airborne yeah airborne was very good but also the original medal of honor that's one of the best games i played when i was growing up medal of honor allied assault oh so good and i think there was one before that on playstation that steven spielberg made with the development team it's a trivia for you there [Music] that's your ceo [Music] green light brother they're going in gladiators going lola oh my goodness attack helicopters what the hell [Music] [ __ ] [Music] what's up stanley hey sphinx [Music] yeah so this game pushed the idea of being in a fire team with a buddy i think it was called the body system this is going to be an ambush isn't it yeah right away play at the beach so i should i think i've got another site on this yeah get some longer range it does feel like there's quite a bit of recall on the gun you know for a single player game interesting no hit markers either like a yen cod there is actually there's quite a bit of recall bit of frostbite destruction there i love that [Music] he's just standing there taking it let's go go go yeah this game is on the 360 right 2012 so it was right before the 360 ended because i think the xbox one came out in 2013 is that right it's difficult to remember all these days the animation is straight out of bf3 i'm sure has this just opened up and we got a breach voodoo let's go come on time for some call of duty so if i if i want to get that tomahawk takedown i've got to get four headshots so these are little challenges for the breach so we'll try and get four headshots here one two three four got it [Music] drop the building how am i going to do that oh okay i've got a laser getting boys level that building come on big booms [Music] damn justin thanks for nine months my goodness he's off for some chicken i can't see a thing there's smoke everywhere this way let's go food stump up here i think we can get through this way moving inside negative we smoked them smoked them i mean the buildings almost disappeared so yeah i'm not surprised did we get to be wally looks like it's odd yeah 40 mike mike at 762. good to go all right stop hope you ever forgot how to operate this oh yeah it's easy it's just like playing a game i can change weapon as well this thing's got a grenade launcher on it i can't do third person god imagine seeing this in real life a robot on tracks with guns just rolls into your room like what's up try and kill me i can't get over that this way got to use the ramp it's like robot wars it's a perfectly sized hole for wall-e as well look at that this was peak generic shooter era that's pretty uh fun so far can't go that way why did you just block me like that dude nearly crushed wally kind of awkward to control this this way no and that was a dead end wasn't it yeah but it'd be really good if you had a you know like when you played the battlefield games you get a tank at the bottom a picture of a tank that shows you the orientation of the vehicle that'll be super cool are you a bad guy why did you just jump in front of the robot to kill a robot nonetheless these are friendlies here no you leave wally alone that's a bad idea isn't it just moving across an open battlefield like that no wally no no oh he's dead feels bad man your movement tango's in the building you can like lean as well right in this you want to recall are we doing a breach can i do the tomahawk now four of us so what's this one four breach headshots for the next unlock tomahawk good call let's try it out [Music] oh my god dude that's it's a bit violent isn't it got him core bar unlocked we dude we gotta chill i need to relax you know how in bf4 you could like tell your squad to shoot at stuff i feel like that would be really cool in this game it doesn't have that not yet at least it might do further down the line take him down drop him ready to move lads they found a grenade at us [Music] oh almost got killed then there's one there there we go yeah tom's the multiplayer on this was interesting i quite enjoyed it and it didn't have massive scope or scale i think it was pretty fun for the most part i need to watch out for that grenade i nearly missed that then i gotta get across the street ow all right we're moving let's get in there if we can flank this guy with the machine gun that'd be great got him i don't want to pick up the akm just yet i don't think it's got a scope on it and i feel like a scope would be really good for this oh a flow an ak eyes on the building headed upstairs 10 o'clock to our front i'm not sure about that grenade indicator feels like it's a bit inaccurate [Music] i'm bingo on ammo i can use the buddy system and get ammo buddies yeah we're playing on pc dustin oh man he had a lot of magazines some nice animations incidentals what's up freck how you doing hello sniper king how's it been i'm good man i've had a good week just waiting for some 2042 news really played a bit of war zones with rpgs dude on the gun is dead sorry who was driving this oh they were shot i thought it was driving itself i'm pretty sure that's not a tesla okay here we go another bridge four breech headshots shotgun crowbar just options you know options i tell you what i didn't even see that dude can i switch my pistol for the ak stick with it for now i just want to see what it's like it's got a big cobra site on it you feel like they're going to drop the beta when you're on holiday do i think they should bring this franchise back i think it would work with modern graphics so dice would have two ips i don't know like i don't think they could do another modern medal of honor unless it was completely different to battlefields because it's ea isn't it you know they've got the ip that's not going to last long look oh here we go here we go a bit of sniping it was a really sick sniper section in medal of honor 2010 where you're up in the mountains i think you're in afghanistan or something i just aimed for bullet dropped skinny down target they just want me to take out the rpgs you gotta aim a bit higher than that that's a headshot stuff great shot went through the legs on the right hand side with ak birds coming in mate i've killed them all it's a waste of armor that's just a shower force oh no rpg effect the tower dead cellar type deck i think i got that one then fire the handed too stop help us out all those years of bf sniping paid off have i seen the new update sniper guys is this really necessary is this do we have to do do we is this i mean they went harm on those buildings let's back up my trainer is at 220. in madrid yes madrid at least someone will be happy to see you she is in the car she's asleep she thinks you walk on water there's nothing i could say that could change that don't expect what you're expecting when you see me i got the message i'll get my own room at the hotel but i do expect time with bella and you and i can talk just talk we've had the same conversation a hundred times don't just don't not yet something happened everything's changed tom what's changed who you are what you do what

preachers doing not well packed it up took his honorable discharge and headed straight from madrid says he's going to fix his marriage good on him madrid lane and belong at home now they're with their parents oh no not like this oh my god bang there's a lot of screen tearing on the cutscenes oh the game just crashed i think no we're good he just closed and reopened and carried on playing that's quite unusual yeah i've got eyes on him all right he's heading towards the ship let's wait for the drop and see where he goes [Applause] thank you chris and we're driving i wonder where the target is guys come on i don't know if the writing's big enough [Music] watch out guys why are you just walking there so casual do whatever my goodness i feel like i've got control here though so i could easily mess this up it's like assassin's creed but with cars let's destroy things it's frostbite oh no oh we're nearly flipped up [Music] am i gonna have to smash into them give me old one two with the front bumper there's a thunderstorm oh no oh watch out lads keep it up hey i am trying as best as i can here oh no oh no oh what's up with the bikes there's traffic everywhere oh no i've gone the wrong way [Music] lads can i can you please excuse me i'm doing a live stream here i mean [Music] [Music] i thought i was done for that guys if this was an uber it's a one out of five isn't it yes oh i closed them down now i like the music truck no move out the way truck please this truck ain't legal i love that his truck ain't illegal he's got the nas on it this is kind of fun oh they're smashing everyone's livelihoods up think about the insurance costs whoa what's up [Music] [Music] do i even have a gun i don't know come on [Music] i don't want to have to deal with any more traffic please oh no we're back on the [Music] road are they just chilling out on the back of the bus he's gonna have an acquaintance oh the chicken i'm sorry that was someone's dinner come on dice i know you had a hand in this game this isn't going to end well [Music] he is he's back get him on the corners boys get him on the corners my car's better better on the corners oh got him what a chase [Music] i have to pay respects to the chicken what why does the game close and then reopen when it loads a new level what no it's been 48 hours why does it do that no i know hold on let me call you back i've never known a game that does that preacher hey you're in a hospital in madrid can you hear me oh yeah they're all right they're all right they missed their train elena mr train tom oh his mummy [Music] no that wasn't scripted daniel that chase i was controlling all that i think it was scripted at the end maybe because the truck slows down a bit in front of you so you can jackknife it [Music] switch his engine between driving and shooting maybe that's true maybe it loads a different version of the game for that mission that's a really good point chat i'm a play multiplayer i don't even know if multiplayer is still on on this game oh this is an mp7 one more down there's another one there mate a tsunami or something price no it's not captain price [Music] i like this camo that's all gone thank you for the 50. that's very kind to you thank you very much they've got some new stickers on youtube as well it's cool i have to talk like this to sound as cool as possible all the time but it really hurts my throat the camera on my gun matches the camo on the characters there's just one guy here double kill collateral i'd love to have a scope on this instead of the onsite i've got a scope on this is that suppressed though can i inspect it i don't know right we got a new one didn't we shotgun good call i mean that's not stealthy at all is it let's be honest there show me the head show me the head [Music] you did not want to show me the head dude you need to chill right has got a suppressor on it hold it stop it you have any air support what about either right i think we can handle that get the ltlam to mark that it's a soft flam bang bang bang here we go do you think you could call in air support that quickly in real life is it that quick surely it's not that quick oh i'm sorry i like this m4 i think he's got a loud weapon though graphics are better than vanguard and far cry 6. i don't agree with you there have you seen the single player trailer for vanguard the graphics on that are insane mother what's that oh my god it just spawned out of nowhere that one's got the bf3 flashlight before it was another that's horrible grenade you can even slide as well this game was doing all the things before it was cool i like throwing those grenades when was this release 2012. there's no way to change the sensitivity on the scope unfortunately that's cool ready what's next doorknob charge it's gonna run into the doorknob oh it's a it's a charge that he puts on the door and blows it off i thought like charging like a ball i thought he was just gonna run into it like the kool-aid man oh man i'm such an idiot mike thank you so much man looking forward to your 2042 content yeah me too [Applause] oh man we're going in well that actually gives me ptsd that's about the bf3 flashlight oh lads wrong place one time what the good he was annoying me i feel like i should keep my current weapons though i mean look at this what the hell this really was ea's attempt to make call

he's dead you can prone as well like if i need to take cover oh no oh i think i nearly killed me and my mate there with a grenade that'd been bad ow please nice spare me a beg alex thanks for the five do you think they will bring back the medal of honor franchise i don't think anytime soon or maybe like in five years or something i think they'd have to reboot it though and who would make it which studio what the hell that was cool teammate threw a grenade there and moved the ai out of cover thank you for the ammo we gotta go there nope still alive yeah really trigger happy with those grenades yeah danger close on the studio anymore so it would have to be a different developer where did the rpg come from top deck i'm scared of being rpg'd look wait the grenades bounce so much can you take the suppressor off no you can't not in single player you can in multiplayer though this game had quite a robust customization system for the guns it was cool oh that's the sun i thought there was a guy stood here with a flashlight because the lights are so bright in this game oh that's funny it looks the same uh multi bronius thank you here's lithuanian there you go [Music] mine landed up there hopefully otherwise i'm dead [Music] mother are you gonna cover me dude you can't just let him shoot me in the back with a shotgun oh god ow nearly got killed then oh he's up there i see him come on

charge i've nearly unlocked them all already [Music] put all these tools at his disposal oh no [Music] there's no one there wilson this game is dimly lit it is quite a dark game yeah i think i don't want to make betty i'm cool thank you that's a big door that's a big door isn't it i've seen a few doors in my tire and that is a big door it's a wide door that's not a regulation size door that's

whatever's going on out there affects you affects us [Music] think about the alien child just a little the alien child needs a father i'm living on black holes start shooting oh double kill okay they're doing more damage now i recognize that theme isn't this this is a multiplayer theme doesn't it is this a new game no storm this is from 2012 it's a really bad place to sit that isn't it there's a sniper why did you that was obviously gonna happen guys you've seen black hole down haven't you such a great movie guys it's got a lot of actors in as well who weren't famous at the time but uh really famous now if you go back and watch it you'll be like oh oh there's um there's venom and there's a spider-man and there's that guy and there's that other guy is that orlando blue what's he doing again a really really bad place to stop this should be remastered i think a remake would be cool but i don't know about remaster i'd rather than make a new game than like remake this or remaster it like a new medal one again it would be cool oh he's right he was opening my grill that guy wanted my dog tags please you can't get dope you mcgregor's in it as well yeah that's right everyone's in it mother can we do the kool-aid man no he's just going in [Music] tiger12 you took that shot i do what i'm ordered to do the [ __ ] general should have known better all right he's really annoyed at tiger12 [Music] didn't confirm the kill [Music] three two one helicopter right on queue oh here we go gonna kill streak everything burns over here i can't aim up look at the barrels getting hot on the minigun that's cool any more those are on there on the balcony i think we're clear great work great work stump good job that door just opened by itself he's down there was just one guy left it was booby-trapped obviously [Music] with the kidnappers what do we do tell me what to do we go in and get those hostages they're dead if we don't move now from this point on i have control i take charge [Music] this is game that came after bf3 i feel like bf3 does look better than this though but dice obviously had a lot more experience with that engine it's their engine this way i mean it still looks pretty good though considering it's nine years old now so [Music] we're gonna climb up the window this one that one i could have done that mother the ai just boot me out the way it could be behind any of these doors keep pushing i'm determiner it's not a dead end there's a secret compartment or a breaching charge look at this assignment thanks to the 20. do it that's rainbow six get back go go go move it [ __ ] oh no don't worry he's dead oh 10 o'clock chris thanks for the 10 would i play medal of honor 2010 sometime maybe although i did actually say that though when it came out so i've already played through the medal of honor 2010 campaign it is pretty good though but i've only ever played the first mission of this one so this is all new for me makes it a bit more interesting i don't even see that guy there you think this keeps track of how many bullets you find from this game but i get some stats at the end you fired 50 000 bullets where's that grenade i can't even see it it's egon from ghostbusters what's he doing here where hey we have friendlies on the second floor what's your fire up there next check go go go go move everyone is moving the hostage location now destroyer look at that a little bit micro destruction there and booby trapped everything in this place how dare you [Music] kind of weird how you've got infinite ammo for your secondary not your primary what the hell can you smoke or something i just some guy came barging through oh they're watching poltergeist got him how's that for a flank it's clear lads come in it's fine where are the hospitals there's a big machine gun here we go this is the breach that we've all been waiting for i think i feel like this i've got to be careful here all right we ready for this we'll use the linear charge because last time we did that it was a debate can you pick up the mg-42 i don't think so here we go no hostages oh no they're here i'm going to go into ripper are we i'll see see how it is come on then let's go if it's still playable and there are still servers i might do a video on it bit of a retrospective look at it if it still works if i quite liked it at the time it did get a lot of hate though this game i really aim it very well oh my goodness i got trucks on the bridge whoa what the hell is going on oh we got some chinooks got the blackhawk where's the little bird or the osprey it's beaming with that minigun oh the bumblebee everything explodes it's fine just deal with it chat it might not be realistic but it's fun and it looks cool whoa it's pirates of the caribbean but on hard mode and you might die i want some naval warfare and i'm not talking about do they have this level of maneuverability in real life can you move them this quick are they really that agile or do video games just pretend a stuart thank you for becoming a member it's very funny copy that's true isn't it i'm glad that they're finally going to put down console because i think there's a big market for that type of game there there isn't really any competition right now so sandstorm will probably be really popular if they price it well this is dangerous oh i knew it there's no way they're that maneuverable in real life god [Music] i was driving this is cool watch out for sharks you didn't switch engine that time though [Music] come on we're gonna go faster the hostage is dying is going to die watch out for the we rockets it i'm sure that cargo ship has some bad company [Music] okay we got you we're going home now and level good to go we're good hooked up let's go go roger that the ribbon bf4 doesn't have this much detail yeah that's right it's in multiplayer though isn't it although the rib is in single player at one point look at this air lifting the vehicles you could do that in bf remember [Music] hey barrett boy what's up keegan do you remember medal of honor rising son i know what it is but i never played that one they're calling it task force blackbird i'm going to need some time get healthy but do it quick the world's going to [ __ ] right before our eyes looks like voodoo and the boys are going to be busy stump uh what's up my name's stop nice to meet you busy on shore we want money same as oh it's a solution the lifeboat is arguing with each other it's not good [Music] just got to be patient that's once you all over the bottom i go these [ __ ] pop up it's whacking them all the time now we're on the wheelhouse there we go [Music] ready to shoot it's my bullet oh my night captains eardrums of bursts right now stomp don't miss captain reminds me of that arcade sniper game i used to play when i was a kid silent scope it was called that was so good i spent all of my pocket money on that whenever we'd go on holiday as a family when i was a kid i'd be in the arcade i'll be playing teenage mutant ninja turtles the x-wing game here and you're ready and it had an actual sniper rifle that you picked up and you looked through the lens and you used to like pull the trigger and shoot people in the game that was so good red light i think it was called silence always green it is p-e-t-n we're seeing and the kind used in madrid is a similar composition to more recent attacks that haven't made the news yet so the connection is real and sad all day is involved we'll see that [ __ ] turned into a ghost overnight but we've learned a few things intel's point of the p-e-t-n moving through tribal areas to couriers in afghanistan and beyond at the request of someone known only as the cleric that sounds vague and ominous so we thought we would back up the chain right remember you're in pakistan there's a line you don't cross how close to the line can we get so close you got chalk on the cleats check your email you got some chalk on your cleats he's a jv gun runner who wants to make varsity he has his hands on everything from knockoff eight keys and rush numbers what's up cj how you doing hey jari black market kebabs black market kebab that sounds quite tasty i'll go for one of those right now bit of chili sauce bitter garlic mayonnaise delicious remember you're on your own here and our job is not on the best terms with the isi so let me be clear don't get caught so get settled and hook up with ajah faraz is a target find him clapper is that true is this game actually based on real life events to a certain degree uh twist thank you for becoming a member i like your profile picture very good i'm in pakistan now hey paul what's up so lots of people are saying in the chat that it is based on real events i didn't know that this mission is anyway some of the events so there's a bit of fiction here as well it seems our bc yeah the simpsons arcade game was amazing all those was the x-men simpsons i don't suppose i have to kill this guy remember don't shoot it yeah i was about to i switched to my knife everyone knows that you run faster with a outrun me i'll be knife eyes headed north oh cool i've seen the office i know how to park up don't let him out of your sight uncle he's on the rooftop [ __ ] i mean my guy looks like he isn't even breaking a sweat and this dude is just giving it everything i'm just doing a lighter jog right now while holding a pistol [Music] i wasn't expecting that all of a sudden you got to shoot people so i have to be careful though because i don't want to shoot the target wherever he is gone somewhere his crosshair was blue though so i've gotta be careful dude this guy's murdering everyone see the game's baiting me it was like come on shoot and fail it come on he's just out in the open the game just baiting you go on shoot him it's not going to happen mother i have eyes on everything hey oh that guy didn't even see me i'm invisible yeah right did they reveal because i know navy seals and even some military they have non-disclosure agreements don't they so they they can't talk about certain missions is that why they got in trouble where's he gone he's over there it's why the

bloodstone really good game no i've not played that i've not actually heard of that when i played golden eye a lot when i was a kid on the nintendo 64. i played nightfire on the was it gamecube nightfire and there was one with daniel craig that i played but i don't remember the name of it there's our job [Music] go go go move it the gun sounds are pretty good yeah you're right john richard i've got that bulletproof glass oh roadkill 100. in the desert now hello nolan from utah i love you what's up man looks like you boys are going to need to put on your sunday best i'm pulling me out of the sandbox hope you do clean up good sooner we get our asses out of pakistan the better get to pesh we'll get you on a black flight to the gulf let's see if we can get this hassan to tell us something we don't know roger that dusty hey janelle love you what's up gabriel there's mako province aqap controlled territory chief of station put him in the air 40 minutes ago green light bright green reporting indicates a major facilitation of weapons training in a possible p-e-t was there a bit of controversy with this game because if i recall correctly you could pre-order the collector's edition and it came with an actual axe is that right was that this game so oh it says they're inspired by actual events so you guys are right green oh every target is designated as an enemy combat find the p-e-t-n affirmative all right andreas from india what's up it was the other game to do with the conflict in afghanistan i thought it was this game that had the axe maybe i'm wrong only usa got the apps i mean it does like the guns do sound also like i think they've recorded real versions of them maybe i know a lot of game developers do that sometimes this was a multiplayer level i remember this in multiplayer [Applause] put that rpg down the multiplayer had kill streaks as well didn't it do you want battle log back for 2042 no not really battle log was cool but loading your game on a internet browser just feels a bit weird you know by today's standards i mean it was really good for the fact that you had so much customization and filtering but i think you know games have become much more casual and accessible now and simplified everything these guys are all dead wee rock dolls yeah i don't think we'll ever get anything like battle log again for battlefield bang if you leave your browser open as well it can hold ram and memory it doesn't really work for console either you know like google chrome takes so much memory i know a lot of people have switched to like firefox and opera gx though so i've not tried it myself but chrome does everything that i need so i just make sure that i close it when i play a game green repeat fallen angel requested thanks to the two i wish this game would have stuck around yeah i definitely remember this from multiplayer yeah it was really cool for the stats having but i love i'd love it if they offered that level of transparency in-game you know like with 2042 if there was a section on the menu where you could see all of those kind of stats abby nate whoa that was close never ending magazine seems so erica this guy's so serious good evening stephen i'm good thank you how are you stoned i've just came out of a coma is this a new medal of honor game coming out or something no i just wanted to play this i i don't have any insider information or anything like that like that there's a new medal of honor game being made i just fancied playing it i did bf4 a couple weeks ago and i did bf3 earlier in the year now those kind of games that are like three and a half to four hours long they're perfect for this kind of thing because i can stream them and then it becomes a rod afterwards that any anyone can watch you know they don't have to be here for when it's live scott i have a zoom on it what's my secondary is that uh a12 it's terry crews oh it's a big guy that's a new enemy type grenade's work dude he sponged all those bullets big time let's go lads do the matrix thing do the matrix thing yeah look at that it's the matrix thing go ahead make one i need to just clear the way first quite an accurate grenade there i'd like to do more breaching i think let's go oh slide i feel like i'm playing black ops when i do that what the hell is that oh no i've died where do we start from the flinch when being shot at seems a bit excessive it's not bad i wonder if i can go up here straight yeah i can just go piss right away oh no wonder he was taking so long he's got the armor he's got that pubg level 3 helmet that dude railed me before roger yeah it's quite excessive the flinch you're right get used to it though where's that grenade blow me dead guy i wonder if he was the one that just killed me with that shotgun hello [Music] yala means go doesn't it need to grab some ammo hey give me some ammo tickets [Music] zoom out for this right what's the last one a sheet charge is that the only one we've not done oh just one two that's it [Music] i think this is definitely shotgun time here guys or maybe not cover me it means hurry or let's go i suppose it depends on the context right are we getting on this the big gun how it sounds where's those rpgs coming from are the helicopters coming in that never ends i think he has the rpg up there damn it ruin that place let's go boys i presume it's up here let me guess i'm not allowed to open that dingo door does that does look a lot like stone that's so weird wrong place wrong time the headshot sound that you hear there my muscle memory is telling me that that's the sound it made when you've got a kill in multiplayer pretty sure that was be baby trapped surely things always go south they always go start i feel like that shotgun should do more damage at that distance that's where i was at the start of the game i mean it's pathetic that shotgun it's no model 37 from battlefield v i can tell you that dude i can't even see that guy i think he's behind that die already the trixie one sicario you know what i love the original sicario i haven't seen the second one yet but it didn't get very good reviews but i should watch it anyway i just haven't had a chance to [Music] that slide was pretty slick oh come on you can't penetrate that you get it [Music] hey what's up he's running into the wall [Music] my grenade on him he's looking this way rather than at these three guys there's a bit more action in it okay i think one of the things that's so good about sicario is that it's so tense so we've used all these now which one's my favorite i kind of like the tomahawk enemy down richard how you doing is this live how does the closed captions know what he's gonna say so andrew i'm a time traveler you see and i knew you were gonna say that message so i time traveled back in time to reply to you on the microphone stay quick on the trigger we gotta do it there you go all right a bit different than we have to be stealthy now reality is often disappointing youtube just has a little bit of a delay on it and it's very good it actually transcribes what i'm saying live in that time in that delay it's about 30 seconds but it means that if you want to watch the stream with the volume down or low you can see what i'm saying it's a great accessibility feature the hell do i do this nothing do you want what do you want me to do guys [Music] oh i see you wanted me to shoot oh here we go here we go and 0 30 now i kind of feel like i'm a bit overpowered now the game's glitched i remember this i hope it doesn't glitch and i hope you meant what just happened with the generator this is a mock-up airplane isn't it [Music] dude good [Music] the scripting is a bit slow sometimes oh no they've turned the lights on nods off mods off that's a little shorty good sound [Music] it's cool looking okay i want my nods on again i'd like them back please the night vision isn't realistic i think the best night vision level that i played is the town house from modern warfare 2019 that is so good i think that's one of the best single player levels in an fps game anyway they did a developer interview oh my goodness might be dead here can get away from that grenade they did a developer interview last year and there was some crazy statistic like that level on its own has more custom animations in it than the entirety of modern warfare 2. it's crazy the amount of work and effort they put into it those big guys always get me uh no the service is still up apparently red wings people have been coming in my chat saying that they still play it [Music] so [ __ ] silly station hey they've done mock-ups of everything it's like a metro or a subway this isn't it they took these models from bf3 i want to see that big guy again and i'm going to hold back he comes got him just had to stay back a bit didn't i take a bit of a couple for a second a little bit of the head there sticking out this is captain blindfire over here thinks he's playing cod vanguard oh just teleported no biggie you got a weapon stash chemical weapons maybe holy [ __ ] that is a lot of boom boom a lot of boom boom yeah it looks like there's a lot that's missing too no doubt there's enough here to blow half this mountain off dusty voodoo look we just found the petn there's a lot of it there's even more that's missing starting to take shape i think you can assemble that rat hole and get in the air roger the nuke throttle what the [ __ ] yeah we failed as soon that could not be close aren't they boom boom let's go show me the boom boom there it is he just destroyed that mountain what did that mountain do to anyone huh didn't deserve it i gotta tell you bro we saw some wicked [ __ ] back there in that compound short version you can brief oga when you've landed that's more acronyms get back to the main bridge stay nimble stay ready i think this guy is the mole yeah go ahead ready to get to work he's pulling the strings behind the scenes hang on we're getting some weird weather-related interference on the overhead it's levolution is it oh it's a driving level it switches engine like it's so i've never seen a game do this okay we're back online today's the day gents the sun as usual will enter at 16 30. now he travels with an entourage of six hey samurai cam what's up before traveling to the hotel one in the lobby yeah the subtitles are very small guy outside the door and one in the room this is where you hit him you got four minutes to get in the car and out of there questions will the song fit in the trunk barely i think what it was when this game came out most runs most runs most games weren't running at 1440p and they didn't account for scaling with the subtitles this would have been running at 720p on the xbox 360. i think vf3 was the same roger dusty i'm in the garage no this is not 2042 sucks i wish it was hey sandro from portugal how you doing that wasn't so bad like picking up my laundry dusty we're on the move i just saw him say anything oh [ __ ] was about it i have a selling laptop [Applause] i don't know if they're in 2014 [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the mirror looks like a real-time mirror that does or a fake camera or something dusty who the hell is this dumb toretto oh no he's got family on his side we're dead talk to us [Music] he's moving in dusty where are you i'm here six flights ahead i need a streak i'm trying my best brother [Music] i love how this car if you look at the steering wheel it's a medal of honor car it's not like porsche or ferrari ford no no this is the medal of honor whoa whoa take the next ride is this was there a need for speed game out when this when this game released in 2012 was there a need for speed game on the same engine as in all right go this right dustin we're going on shakespeare you're not running there oh that one hurt foxy don't let him slow you down dustin how's the traffic traffic too quick there's some daylight before that for you i do i wonder if they like because obviously need for speed instead of making driving physics for the frostbite engine or the medal of honor version of the frostbite engine did they just go you know we're just going to switch engines to need for speed the driving bits and then that makes developing the driving bit way easier need for speed to run what's that on frostbite too can you guys look that up because if that was on frostbite two i think that's what they've done oh no we didn't have 5g in 2012 pull over is it most wanted something need for speed the run was out in 2011 around first place here so that's what they did then vincent i think that's what they've done here whenever there's a driving section it switches engine crazy now medal of honor in 2010 it had a different engine for single-player multiplayer i remember that the single player used unreal engine and the multiplayer used [Music] but that wasn't during a campaign you know i think i have to lay low don't i have all right it's a stealth section i wasn't paying attention [Music] [Music] oh no [Music] oh this is kind of like that game isn't it there's actually a need for speed game where you do this they're the police they just re-skinned them [Applause] okay i'll get it you have to avoid them while the uplink is continuing hold on try again basically i'm a stealth car i'm a stealth car [Music] preacher steady steady hold here is one of my right [Music] preacher steady steady [Music] around here [Music] these guys [Applause] [Music] okay this is kind of cool it's a bit different isn't it i've not done anything like this in the game so far all right let's go we were right near the exit there before all right yeah i think it would have taken quite a while to develop those kind of features if they had to do it from scratch so they just took it from the engine maybe it was a collaboration you lost the connection get back on shakespeare oh no we're in the tunnel we've got no 5g dusty [Music] they've all got identical cars as well through [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i was going to say i was about to stick to the left there but beside you [Music] find the gap oh i'm going this side instead too much traffic there he's moving it switches to cut scenes as well when that happens it's really [Music] [Applause] uplink's weird it goes 30 fps for like five seconds it's on your channel [Music] secondary vehicles this is a big ass car park we did it i didn't know that the game had all this need for speed stuff in it a completely new angle for me i thought the whole thing was just like fps all the way through but they've got this driving section [Music] there's a way that's what i [Music] want close level p3 oh oh where you going i like these in real life these are really fun multi-story car parks man that's all it needs to entertain me just so i can go round and round in circles in my car i'll do some more [Music] roger [Music] what's up guys i advise sorry [Music] uplink's like 90 done [Music] oh we're going in the sandstorm it's the true revolution now this guy please he's gonna swipe me i don't want it get away need a faster car how's going on down there i'm on the wrong side of the road no idea this is very stressful for me guys on the bridge here i think he's gone thank you oh thank god for that that was high key stress right there [Music] oh ruined absolutely fast and furious vibes oh it's that dude the crazy guy that shoots his own men get ready for the engine change no not ruined random screen of a car switch the engine switch the engine we're back in the game that was a cool mission i enjoyed that [ __ ] it's been hours and no word for mother preacher to tell me some good news brother well hassan's laptop was full of it's a little complicated but it boils down to this the clerics network uses two ships out of the port of dubai so the petn found in somalia it's not originating in dubai terrible driving jack red wings car trying my best i'm sorry the laptop was a treasure trove we were able to find payments to accounts tied to stovan boat chicken sarajevo no [ __ ] yeah he's an arms dealer the jihadist [Music] hey james thank you i worked with him he smuggled arms to the bosnians during the war and then helped us run down serb war criminals in the mid 90s he's a survivor but greedy very greedy no [ __ ] can you grab him i know who can he's going to love this jesus it's your lucky day recent intel points our old friend stovam bojic as our petn supplier you sure did brother get up there bring him in and i'll buy you a beer get up there bring him in there why do you not see this guy's face is it the dude from medal of honor 2010 is that why or a background stump again my name's stump and i like to pump blue rich [Music] we were watching the cutscene polsky that's what we were watching do anything this man tells you unless of course he tells you to meet him in the whole house in damascus oh that was your idea if i recall probably how have you been well yes yes i've heard so you're the big man now i understand well nothing seems to last does it greco no if we move quickly we can surprise him wow i think there's an ied there guys i think there's an ied there they made it very obvious didn't they well you would wouldn't you you would make it obvious a little is this the new warzone map yep we're playing warzone right now this is sick i'm using the scar-h for the commando for grip monolithic suppressor 60 round mag new map's great weapons what is it's like an spr are you gonna peek again you could you could take some cover at least you know you could at least just hide behind something i don't know rpg like fishing a barrel monolithic am i aiming too here we go i think i was aiming too low bit earlier there is a bit of a drop on the snipers in the single player too roger that stump him has come and he's ready for pumping where's my where's my sniper gun i'd like it back please can you friendly fire in this i don't know i've not done it yet oh [Music] please nice think about the children i want my sniper back i'm really sad only let me use it for a little bit how come whenever i throw a grenade they always throw a grenade back i think the ai knows is it programmed so whenever i throw up i throw one it does it too is that what it is it's cheating i suppose i don't need some ammo with you my friend thank you shotgun's not very effective from there this game was released in 2012 muhammad why are people shooting in a mario game i mean this is not mario game i don't see chris pratt you are so annoying what do you guys think about chris pratt being cast as the voice of super i know a lot of people were very unhappy with it because it's not the original voice actor who's done it for years in all the games but please just run through it like the kool-aid man like i thought it was good no he's not going to do that this is our normal normal difficulty jack it's always four there's always four follow me the bombs everywhere i'm gonna walk into a claymore or something online well that wasn't a very smart idea [Music] i can hear them but where are they uh did you just come on dude that is so risky jumping over an ied are you kidding watch out we got a badass over here hey chris happy sunday to you too everywhere you once tried this on the hardest difficulty one shot and you're dead you've got two hours in a dive and then you have to start it again is it like the dark souls of fps games you really have to complete it all without dying i've died i've died once from a gunshot or actually twice and i've died once when uh the cars got me in the stealth car section which i didn't realize was the stealth car section to begin with because i wasn't paying attention chris thanks for the one grenade look out it doesn't feel like a 2012 game you mean in a good way do you mean the graphics the gameplay i think it saves quite well the gameplay is quite simple though you know like if you release this today i don't think it would get good reviews we're breaching again saying that though like we played the bf4 campaign recently and that looks like a modern game at times like the graphics on it is so good 4k will this be backwards compatible on the xbox series x i'm not sure can you even get this on xbox still on the arcade in a good way yeah one death and you're back to the beginning wow so that's quite challenging then i suppose you just have to cheese it right this reminds me of a flood zone they've got no cover here whatsoever kick it open the full breach i want his guy it looks cooler than mine uh we'll do crowbar [Applause] yeah these guys are definitely more supportive than the ai and bf4 i see so you can only use the sniper rifle when the game lets you at certain moments not really any bullet drop from that kind of distance get in there greco boom no no no no no no it's stone cold and they just got wasted there's a big mad again get him all magazines say that dude please help me team ruined buff no thanks for the five the game was way ahead of its time it's call of duty warfighter from the year 2023. do you think call of duty will ever make a game called warfighter for all the grenades they don't seem to do very well with the grenades today when in doubt pro grenade geico i don't want your insurance oh you can go up why didn't i do that i should have considered my options better are these old arcade machines i want to oh my god he's on the arcade machine dude i bags did that one come on what do we have allied assault ah it's a medal of honor easter egg doesn't look like a world war two game though does it what the hell what is the ai doing okay so they've obviously tuned them up here they're way more aggressive clear on top [Music] was so much fun like the multiplayer on that game i used to play it with my mate at school we both had 56k modems but man just running around with the tommy going like on um what was the town map called began with c oh that was so much fun the con idea because it was on the quake engine i've just run across two ieds and i'm fine no big deal nbd nbd greco what's the deal julius the engineer's close but he won't just give up you'll find to the end okay let's just make sure it's his head it's not going to be ours my friend oh no my friend let's go [Music] dusty voodoo go ahead voodoo look brother we're deep into this now and it's bigger than we thought you get bow chick no no yeah dusty was in medal of honor 2010 i remember that where the [ __ ] is this stuff it's covered tell me you've got people working i'm built different time just kidding ieds no big deal roger listen bro there's something i gotta do right now good coffee make go

skating i'm so bad at ice skating oh my goodness look at this oh it's a boss fight i got thermals i don't have towels don't worry i can see the solar flare that is the torch survive i'm surprised that was the first grenade they're throwing at me smoke's dissipating a bit bit of friendly fire oh why didn't they give you thermals for this bit it's the gulag you guys are funny survive here and you can redeploy if you don't make it your teammates can buy you back something like that just give me a thermal scope i can't see anything [Applause] no big deal don't worry don't worry it's fine oh the pick up the picture neck can we do a bit of skating please that'll be good halo reach ending oh jose you don't have to do me like that man hit me right in the fields always handy to have some bolt cutters

run over them it's fine i'm practically the hulk one grenade though and i'm dead hello please i picked up an ak it's fine watch out for the grenade he pulled the pin and you heard it but you didn't see it interesting scarecrow thank you for becoming a member [Music] aimbot who's chin what's how are you supposed to aim this that's literally on the guy's head in the center but it doesn't it doesn't work i see that bloody hell did you come from left on me let's go it's quite foggy am i still enjoying tarkov i haven't played tarkov for ages camo i need those bulkers again where's the air support i think we're in a foreign country where we don't have jurisdiction so there just isn't any not this time this whole time you've told me not to shoot them and then you just tell me to shoot

older sisters you've gone to a denny's that's me that's where they made their first mistake yeah okay i'll take that as a chance to hit the ladies don't hit the ladies how many up craig hey daryl yo that's a nice looking burger remember the last time the four of us [Music] i've been married to that man for 22 years one of the things i've learned that some of the other wives didn't is that it's better to have them happy than to have them safe so [Music] foreign you have very persistent friends why don't you tell me who they are ronald mcdonald and the burger king family my brother's called

reload animation doesn't work it's fine we're playing doom anyways [Music] [Music] he's right there i picked that up just in case okay now the reload works it's strange playing the game that doesn't have ads reloads you know modern warfare there was other games before modern warfare that have abs reloads obviously but it's i'm so used to that now [Music] 2042 has it as well vanguard black ops cold war it feels like it's a a staple out of fps games just a lot more immersive i guess [Music] being able to stay on target while you reload there's just something cool about it yeah picking up the weapon fix the reload it's fine just see the top of that guy's head oh it just shot behind me well that didn't work it's bulletproof it was you wow just blind firing from behind that box [Music] he's still there no i must have got him maybe not shut down let's go around this way no there's another one on the left i still think there's one up here right there [Music] i get that guy i know i hit him but i didn't think i killed him oh my god he nearly killed me that would have sucked right at the end where do you get this game i just got on origin that was a cool section i enjoyed that quite claustrophobic you know all these bodies i'm glad that they're not throwing grenades at me i hate that alarm awful [Music] me on the day get to the bridge i'm gonna go and get over there [Music] uh ow that really hurt there's a full battalion on this ship yeah there is maybe i should switch to my uh assault rifle now what do you think foreign i thought i killed you got him finally that lmg was so annoying there's a bit of spread and inaccuracy there for that range [Music] it's interesting keep on moving dead end [Music] i just saw someone back there i think i got him yeah i got him now i feel like chris hemsworth in extraction are doing the second one of that by the way i don't know if you saw the trailer yesterday oh i killed you i'm gonna come across a big guy maybe [Music] i'll make sure double tap in the head i love that you got infinite ammo too long way is this game already out yeah it's been out since 2012. oh here we go here's the boys coming onto the ship [Music] chase [Music] so many of those moments in the game where there's a door and you just you just can't go through until the ai has decided to burst through it your gun was floating mate i think this is the

on there wasn't that okay there's the machine gunner let me out what are we preaching i don't know what we're creating to be honest we are the preacher though oh in the plums it's gotta hurt how was that movement wow [Music] world war three still has its place aren't world war three doing like a big they're doing a big update right coming out soon i saw the trailer it looks like they've made a lot of improvements to the game to be honest scripting let's go go kill shots what this guy's what he did the same thing last time as well he just like he jumps around like crazy up blazing how you doing it's an lmg guy isn't it oh he's flanking get it why is world war three it's kind of like a battlefield clone it's weird it's like a mix between a hardcore and a casual shooter i played it a couple years ago i'd like to play the new version though check it out see how much it's improved or whatever it was kind of like bf4 when i played it but it didn't run very well and there was a lot of like hardcore mechanics mixed with like casual mechanics and i'm not sure it didn't quite feel right so yeah i'm interested to try it again destroyed destroyed we're going to go across the bridge could i not put night vision mode on this oh careful some nades in there i'm in wally must destroy wally kill wally name don't they actually use xbox controllers to control these in real life i'm sure i read that somewhere was it the drones something ran modern warfare through silver you're sure get in there lads buddy vehicle this these ai they just rush you horrible i hate them let's go move kobe cannot get a rocket launcher got him i get to use it now turn it around no it was what it was facing the right way and then when i got on it it turned it around weird i made the assumption that i would have to turn it around myself when in fact the game just did it for me guys the gate the gate's open now you can go we can go through now guys dude that feels really old-fashioned you can't you don't have the choice to leave that you have to kill all the enemies and then it just kicks you off it and then you can carry on can you play multiplayer anymore yeah you can i bet there's some people playing it still someone came in earlier and said that they're an admin that run a server there's probably a really hardcore community that's still playing this in multiplayer now you want to leave that building everything's on fire i can't see anything it's so dark i mean that's hardly a contact did we go prone there because of the smoke i think so anton thanks for the five we're back up i'm
