hey everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more call of duty warzone season five launch today i haven't actually played any war zone yet today i wanted to save my first impressions for this live stream i have played modern warfare and i've been leveling up the two new guns which are the an-94 and the little smg apc acp it's got a different name but what we're going to be doing today is playing with study and fireborn hopefully we'll be dropping into the stadium we'll be checking out the train checking out all the new easter egg stuff if we can find it i have seen a few things on social media but this is one of the new weapons the air 94 i haven't maxed it out max level is 66 but i've got a few different attachments for it there it is and get 45 round mag i think that's i'm gonna guess that's 50 or 60. but as you can see that's what we're working with here so far it's looking pretty good i need to actually get on it and uh finish leveling it up and this is the new smg the iso again not maxed it out nearly there but that's part of a blueprint i think that you get in the battle pass so i don't know how this is going to go like i said this is all brand new for me i haven't played it yet today in terms of the operators i did unlock a couple of the new ones so we got the new rose skin which looks absolutely terrifying it's the rook but near dark merc you get those from doing challenges i've also got the big boy lurch i mean that is he's pretty talled up there let's be honest but we're going to be playing the rose today i think there's a few of the skins i don't know did i get the cat i don't know if the cat's in the game yet i don't think the cat's in but there is a there's morrow with cat ears basically and i think you can get a sword here look at this i mean that's a a ridiculous looking sword i'm going to get that i might use that a bit later is that a bright shield a shogun riot shield there's so much news stuff guys i don't i don't know if i'm gonna have time to go over everything in this in this video in this stream but i'm looking forward to it either way so we're gonna join up with uh study and fireborn and drop in i'm excited like i said i haven't played warzone today so it's gonna be good oh i need to get that i need to get that finisher don't i think i have it a crow will we will we get to use it i don't know or is it never more you basically get the raven to pick someone's face off it's uh yep that's going on right then with that said we're gonna unmute discord thank you for tuning in guys let's have some good games jesus ready let's go doggy you know i've got the raven stud no well maybe i do i don't know he cannot have it yeah it's called nevermind you got it can you uh finish people with it yeah that's a takedown have you come up with a good build for the a94 yet i mean um make sure you use the long barrel yeah i've got that on and i've i i don't have a i don't have a mono suppressor for it so i'm using the brake right the recoil and then i'm just using merc 4 grip 45 round mag and mini flex but the vlk also is good too you went merc foregrip yeah i'm not really because it's got a lot of kick to it really interesting i'll try that out i have a four grip on it where do i go um i'll have to see what the ads is like actually can be quite a slow ads build there i've realized but if yeah if you're gonna go long range which is what it's for then be okay probably you can get a 50 round mag on the iso yes i think that makes it a little better okay within reason yeah within reason we'll call it a little bit depressing are you guys are you surprised that they didn't do any weapon tweaks in this patch yes i am yeah absolutely i mean everyone and some just nowhere near enough yeah they buff the fam ass right or something they increase its uh damage over range okay but they didn't make it easy it's a hit no no the thing still won't will just violently shake left and right yeah you know what else matters well i know they said that there's uh upcoming weapon changes but obviously in this build of the game we've still got overpowered bruin and foul yes and the foul is insane if you fight anything if you fight anyone with the foul close range you should run away what do you mean everything seems to be working as as intended right if you're the one i'm using the foul yes what's what what's the worst that could happen basically expect everyone to be running the foul yeah right oh that's skin though look at that the said one yeah everyone looks like they're at stranger things they've gone for that 70s 80s vibe i don't want to go anywhere near the stadium yeah i just wanna i mean should we drop their first time yeah yeah absolutely for the meme yeah um wait hang on let me just let me just try and see if i can so if you drop in the middle there's luke on the stands there's like no loot at all okay there's like absolutely zero loot on the stand so you either have to drop around the edges yeah you don't have to drop around the edges and work with every single door around the stadium you can get in every single one so there's like hundreds of ways to get into the stadium so but there's not enough loot is what you're telling me no but unless we go straight for the center but that will be a hot mess come on great let's do it yeah let's do it i mean it'll be a laugh on it yeah yeah i like how you can inspect your weapon like mint free fall what's the inspect button oh it's i by default on pc okay well i already set my eye to my watch and all my stuff so right well i just heard a raven at the end yeah oh there's two heli's stadium that's the old no there's only one contract there is that usual i don't know i'm surprised there's even one oh i'm excited for this i mean this is quite a there's going to be a lot of people at the stadium in there yes oh yeah although a lot maybe some people go train station although both times i went no one was there okay [Music] you can see like it's got a weird thing roof grill now you see on the train station they didn't have before okay let's do it let's go let's skin this cat i can't wait i can't wait to redeploy oh my god okay not as many as i thought there would be that's had nothing in it no money no gun no okay they didn't even have a they didn't even have a screw you sign in there it was literally just empty you know what's weird the fact that the ground lures changed it's so weird just picking up an album from the ground down one finished one there's two helis in here yep there's three heli sorry and we're all just running people over jack do it again missile locking i don't know where that missile came from oh yeah sure all right i'm in it came from the top somewhere the game for us to get everything at the back of the stadium i can get this guy yeah he's landing there he's got it get out get out oh no i've got i could get that healer yeah do you want it yeah i'll get it yeah there's another guy here we can run over jack get him where on the ground yeah we can run them over again spun them over when you see them come out enemy hello there i'm going for it go for it go for him teamwork run away nice nice nice oh there's someone else he's in there here two guys in there one's busted and down one down yeah one more in there one more one more further back i'm gonna see if i can push another one right here down i hear someone he's one that one further that one below your heels one down they're on me that one's that one there's one there's two people reviving down

i'll grab my gun how's it going there's a guy there's a guy there's a guy there i'm flashed i'm down nice job down here okay no this is crazy he called me a bad word when i killed him i am i'm all about that there's a guy above us i've got three bullets okay what do you need what do you need ar uh thank you i've got an ebr he's waiting above it i think he's wearing above us that was really fun i think or something uh jeffrey walker thank you for becoming a new member that's very kind to you augusto p can you please show us your loadout at the end of this game animal i'm just using the new guns i haven't really decided on what's good or bad for the am94 or the iso yet a 357 magnum are you kidding me it was a 357 magnum guys i mean yeah worst gun in the gila why have they put that back in the gulag the gulag rotates now it's uh once a week every day every day okay i thought it was once a week a red crown okay i got a a blue long barrel ram that's good yeah we're gonna run into some people here this this is it's cavernous i can't describe it in any other way there's a line now let's let's get one of these helis and see if we can get jack back i hear someone above me it could be you did they reduce the cost to respawn now yes four thousand they took 500 off yeah right then interesting uh cody thank you for becoming a member thank you for joining the stream everyone i appreciate you guys being here uh-oh fire just went down there oh study that's dangerous that is dangerous sam thank you for becoming a member and trickster was he trying to catch him then i don't

ah and look he said nice try all right just reset just like something like just pull this out you want to re-cue yeah okay i killed five people there i feel good about that yeah that was good i mean it is manic like that's my first impression it's a bit mad yeah that's uh that's a that's a good way to look at it a bit man the right word hey nicholas what's up hamburger uh deviant and john thank you for becoming members hope you enjoy the emotes and the little icon there hey nicholas yeomchov what's up murray hey murt good to see you guys back here thanks right are we gonna get any wins tonight i don't know i hope so i'm i'm about i'm about killing people wherever we go that's that's my only concern are people going to be dead yes wonderful eventually that's a good concern to have yeah i don't like the music theme as much as the last one i don't have music oh dude did you not hear the season four theme no so good was it really good yeah it's brilliant i mean you can you can watch it on youtube or wherever but it's just very good keep it forever yeah like they did with the apex music they just never stopped using it forever i don't stop that's because you've got that selected however yeah you can change that still the best yeah i think i've got the halloween one as well they've got um radios for cars as well now right um when you get in a car a radio place i think yeah kind of like uh kind of like how you do the jug it's probably even k you have to equip it perhaps i'll run over here to this little uh this little atv and see if i can't test that out oh that's brutal that is brutal ben thank you for the five you're still downloading the update it was a big update alec thank you for becoming a member blind thank you haymaker and paul i appreciate that guys uh shameem thank you for the 10. that was the first game ryan yeah we just had our first game there right you want to go somewhere else train have you had a zone that ended at stadium yet no no that would be mad it's hell it's hell i know it's hell anyway yeah i don't need to test that water to know what's hot right you can just feel it stadium is like bone zone but with more more vertically okay you can we can go through this great here you see yeah i like this little grit i was ready to blast somebody right there one of you all was right beside me uh there's people right here right in front of me right in front of me oh yeah although it's other side as well the p90 does no damage still and he had a oh he had a ram let's do it okay team wipe nice job guys are there more people no i think we've got him oh a p90 dude p90 back in ground loop that's what i'm about it's right there yes i tell you though i feel like the ground leak this time is a little bit worse than last season in terms of how effective you can be with it or yeah like um i don't know a lot of the other guns are really mess okay so the p90 is great there's a really nice m4 you can get to but that's it right come on the others you reckon there's anyone else here i think we've got them uh does this not look like uh like a well-lit um tarkov superstore kind of variant i like them all yeah yeah kind of it does it reminds me of a black ops map because it's a train station oh this is the odin the odin's back here yeah johnny on the spot let's put it on it have you already got a p90 jet yeah pick one up okay that's good to see the bruins still there it's the hund it's the handy round footsteps on me coming for a bit split it could be on the roof or could be below me all right it's a refresh there's a fresh ar there the new one oh hello maybe it was your footsteps below here that's the a 94 yeah uh he's below us he's right here someone's oh yeah he's running he's running he's running what's this cdl yep he called out so he's got friends here okay people holding the stairs it's really fun playing on n a servers because uh people always talk they always talk and you've got a heartbeat sensor nice i think they're going to be coming from this direction i think that's where i heard the footsteps something underneath us around right below us now i'm around town there is a dead silence down at the end of that hall if no one's grabbed it already yeah i got it thanks this is why the doors are like this this is where they would ah i got it it looks like they've looted around here i just i think i just heard someone above us yeah oh yeah i'm up keep going keep going i'm okay i'm okay i'm okay i'm ready these guys load up how can they drop down here i don't think they can't give me slept it's right there right here in front of me oh yeah they got loadouts they got their load up [Music] [Applause] he's above us i can hear him obviously that's a body rolling down did you see that yeah well played the same guy again he's got the right egg what is that skin it that's kind of sick i like that it looks almost like the damnation but it's not it's called main battery okay okay right so is that the main is that the main showcase of train stations yeah that's the idea that's all that's all there is to station okay what about the tres the trainer the train's over here right now jack up here and orange where's on the map oh it's got like five or six different sections on it yeah oh it always starts from next to park you know the big tunnel oh yeah always starts there okay so it's going to come around it's going to loop all the way down past storage town i think we're going to miss it this round yeah we need to get to a shop do we have because we're going to get this money i finally got it oh vehicle vehicle at our shop the shop behind us there now yeah yeah let's do it they just they just got out and they're obviously buying teammates or something uh he's got coal bloody they've got perks [Music] they do have loadout that might be the people hunting no no different team hunting you is getting close to jack as well any hits yeah run back ah man they got c4 i think that's the threat they're inside yep they got a lot of c4 apparently and are your targeting are the people targeting you is getting closer i'm going to shut the back yep there's from the roof yeah that is not a good time they're going to finish with me uh finish one one's pushing for the roof one person in the roof uh yeah yeah i couldn't i couldn't get you because the guy's watching further back here yeah he's i don't know if there's a different team above us as well uh i think he went down here all right he ran yeah he ran through there he's right out here he's right out here he's not pushing in he's lit i need help can you come out is there another save there's another team on the roof because i was landing on the roof coming to you guys but there's one with the skylight where we fell in he's gathering armor he's looking down now i didn't know that guy went left i thought he was right magnum again are you kidding it's time there's like two different teams on the roof annoyingly let's see if i can get to a shop everyone's gonna get pushed by zone oh god i hate that thing so much stay away from the roof jack okay let's just get out of here maybe try and find a place before i won you want to go there yes i think that's the best choice all right we might be able to hold some people out if you get a gun because everyone's right there you're just on he's crossing stud already crossed no he's crossing to your left he's coming at the wall right there turning out yeah yeah i'm getting away from these guys they're chasing me there's two of them by the way i'm going to go fast yeah yeah i'm running i'm running running i'm just trying to get away from them this is squad out to the east yeah just look towards the south as soon as you get your loadout because that's where they're going to come from maybe even southwest station you're on any spare place thought yep okay there's also some spare plates uh two buildings over to your north or southwest but yeah we can get crisp up can't we yes we can once we get to a shop there's one on the left i think these guys have loadouts too the ones that are chasing us all right so i just want to get a it's a respawn southeast ah dude is there any maybe maybe this one yeah i think moving a bit further away you're good guys you do what you got to do yeah yeah yeah you need to buy plates as well once you get there they just rest there jack that's where they just rest pretty sure it's them yeah we're not going to get the train this round are we nah didn't he say it might come back in time it will take a while though i can hear someone finally suppressed up a head start but do you hear that how clo must be close right because yeah oh where where i don't know in the big building i think okay hold on i've got no eyes oh yeah oh i'm gonna make it i've been ruined i've been going oh it's on the right i hear other people as well i hear other people as well ahead of us on the roof right here back up i can buy plates if you want so when you don't know if i can get to you i'll try on the shop team the other side airport i'm going back in about airfield as well less than one finished one one on the second floor one on the second floor okay these guys have had uh loadouts mm-hmm i can just start i was on the second floor somewhere one pushed over marked careful careful careful two down one here one here

look at that train hmm uh matthias yeah it's all on low it's all low i have that turned on so i can see sprays because they're a good name but the rest is uh it's all off that i changed that recently i used to use filmic but i changed it i think it's a bit clearer dude the vehicle songs are just heavy metal like uh pretty much it's like the jug metal yeah it's doom 2016 every day every day is june 2016. chris as an american yep what's your top three cereals top three cereals yeah um if you wanted a snack let's say i'm not talking about what's good for you if you wanted a snack top three okay am i doing it with or without uh milk with milk with milk okay so oreos oreo i don't even know what they are so it's basically it's cookies and cream um cheerios okay basically uh so it's basically like uh like cocoa puffs except for they're made into little rings like cheerios and they've got little bitty like uh little bitty like specklets of of the oreo cream on on the outside of them okay um and then apple jacks oh are they cinnamon or are they more yeah they're like cinnamon they're like cinnamon apple cheerios as well okay um and then probably the s'more cereal which is graham cracker pieces with chocolate and uh marshmallow bits oh you're good at advertising these aren't you chris i just want to try all of them now yeah i mean if you if you want any you let me know i'll send them to you i don't know how to work them it's a big box of cereal yeah it'll be it'll be like a 25 pound box and it'll be massive and it'll be just nothing but diabetic in a box cool battle royale gas is closing in your position so where's it start right there you want to go for it let's go yeah let's do it let's do it this is the drop to go for it so okay let's go first time on the train we played apex or warzone what is this apex zone oh no there's people ahead of me they mean it better oh god one landed on my head come on jack oh they finished nice there's one more guy over here there he is he's freaking bigger he's lit there's three there's three there's three hold on reloading more ammo if you need it i've got plates plate plates i'll go i've got something okay dude okay now i'm out of ammo again i'm down that was fun look at captain price just jiggling around everywhere what's he doing oh he's trying to shoot me in the headstart better weapons than we did it was a whole team on the train yeah really damn there's a full team at the end hey that was a bit uh chaotic i enjoyed that freedom i got cheated by renetti no just you're dead uh i i hit the guy four times and he hit me twice next he's running for an e-stud oh my god nice if i get that magnum again i'm gonna flip 725 it's been so long it's time what if i can get a gun and i can ambush the guys on the train [Applause] so okay it's gonna be like a heist it's gonna come out here we're gonna come out here and we're gonna we're gonna be ready for it oh you wanna drop it further oh it's getting better than i thought it's there all right we can snipe them we can snipe them they're probably gonna want to go to the shop but they've got guns i've got an origin where are they they're dead are they on i don't know they're gone i don't see anyone wearing a gun jack choo-choo dude really i got it there we go so you are guaranteed orange loot oh watch your head oh that's cool go on the back of good knife to another let's just is follow the train oh and just loot on the way jack anything you see on the way past get to the front of the train and then jump on again dude this is sweet this is like an action movie and that's ammo jack yeah that one can you get on the top there i've already used it chris oh [ __ ] that sucks no i don't think you can get it when you came back but i guess not i'm gonna loot this train carriage and then jump back on all right yeah this is super cool man so can you get run over by this i assume you can right i didn't you can actually all right kind of what we're going to learn today i want to keep the brewing i think it's kind of hard to aim isn't it yeah i don't want p90 for this train i've got another plate box jack and some plates here all right let's put the play box down as well yeah do it we need to get some money so get chris back yeah i wanted to be known that i did 137 damage to the guy in the gulag and he didn't die wow that's unfortunate yeah and in his in his death case he had like a sliver of health and i don't know how i like the weapon inspect it's cool they've done that well they're nice i think maybe that's why they didn't add it in straight away because they wanted it to look good oh you opened the door jack what have you got time oh no no no it's fine it's fine yeah yeah yeah i got to stay on the front of the train you're fine i got myself a scar some stopping rounds this is a good route actually because we're going to stay in the circle the whole time we're on a good we're on a good good course good good good i'm gonna i'm gonna loot this house all the way jack all right three two one go you all wanna hear an interesting bargain huh yeah go for it chris okay so ins if you're inside of the train and you jump you will be in the same place on the train when you land if you're on top of a train you'll be further away not not in the game the game doesn't take physical okay into it i'm in the building got some loot oh you mean in real life yeah in real life right yeah is that because of the air resistance yes exactly oh god it's like a treadmill wait is it we're gonna finish [Laughter] oh dear that's funny are we going up on the bridge yeah yeah oh we have enough money jack we have enough i want is there a buy on the way there's one there but we're gonna wait hang on hang on hang on we're gonna go right past this one jack i think we can do it we're gonna do a speed bump i grab this vehicle yeah if i grab this vehicle and we buy and then we can all all three of us get on this uh get back on the train i mean you got a cash box there too oh that one is closer though yeah you're right yeah we need we need the car because then we can get back on do you want the cash stud yeah yeah that was a a drive by car 98 what would you call it a train you need you gotta incorporate train something a train by train buy it's not as catchy as it you know they've done this really well i don't feel like i'm lagging on it or anything i could shoot and it works i can drop cash for you is that going to knock me off it will yeah oh god that is so close right so you stay on i'll uh buy fireball oh hey a child telling me there's a key card on one of the tanks but where is that probably gone if it's there i don't see a key card oh critical damage instantly good good i it stuck to the train jack it didn't work i'm going for the atv instead all right oh it's gone it just touched the train we're dead going for the buy with this atv do not hit vehicles into the truck at the train with vehicles stop down oh and there's a load out there's a load out back um that come to me and get your load out we'll go back on the acv and get this catch up to the train okay there's two guys here okay i'm getting off come get your loadout fireboard and then we'll get we'll all get on the atv and catch up with it again let's play here lovely i already missed the train i'll be driving this one we're getting back on it i'm not getting it away we're gonna do an old an old-fashioned train takedown let's go right i've got a 94 stopping by oh god this guy here wait that's fine just ignore it [Music] yeah let's get the train get straight [Music] he's lucky that we're on a mission i like that you can catch up with it you can't sprint and catch up with it though it goes slightly faster this running is there people on it yeah there was two people on it okay right we're gonna have to do that right you guys are gonna have to make sure i don't die okay catch the tree cj it's gta 5 is it yeah gta san andreas the mission way to catch the trend um i think they're off it's clear that's fine it's our train now don't you touch the train and a vehicle oh dear okay we're still in the zone this is great see if we can get some drive-by snipes jack oh there's people here oh i kind of want to try this burst fire mode in war zone but it's probably trash isn't it it's it you expect it to work and then it doesn't it just it's not it does it's not as accurate it's just spraying it okay i think it's great maybe like a good tap so is this gonna be is it gonna stay in the zone i think it is yeah for a little while oh no it's going to go out the zone in a second yeah so it right here it's going to go out the zone but we can stay on it until it does wow we might have to say goodbye to the train at the border this might be the end of train call me the train we've had i wonder if the train blows up uh i don't think so because it would be devastating for it to end up in the circle at the very end oh someone just oh that's you chris sorry yep just me jumping can you catch the train you're gonna be able to catch the train no he's missed it surely we've gotta jump off we gotta jump off anyway yeah farewell it's nice knowing you train and now no one because we're on the edge of the city we're in the yeah middle of nowhere i could go to promenade there might be people around there oh this has been lured out stand up no hits i got restock i had a shot promenade over it let's move out that's good because i need i need ammo and guns so this will be fun are not guns uh ammo and armor [Music] so apparently now if you drop weapons with stopping power in they still have it in yeah i think so yes it works i've yet to shoot this a 94 in war zone so we're gonna see how this damages did i spot someone then see that red car we can drive that they've added them in fortnight today and also warzone that's not been laird i heard a shot over here though like near orange or something maybe it's a little bit further than that they go resin look let's go for it oh wait let's go this has been 100 over there let's go what are we going towards the the revive yeah so i just see a helicopter over there oh guy there we go someone it's not too far away have you tried dropping a loadout on the train no you think it will carry it it probably will right that'd be really cool it would probably cause massive server issues and i love it repositioning he ran to the right there's another one there one for the right yeah i don't think they've got loadouts i think they're fresh but i saw some either a kept them running right or a um sniper scope some armor there if anyone needs it i'm gonna so i'm here as well chris is there an ammo thing in this building no i think so no sadly enough not that's a bit of cash where'd they go where did they go oh they're at the car dealership on the roof with the healer inside they've dropped inside it found him down him down him nice shot one down there do you want to go across i don't know oh there's a guy there he just got off the roof yeah oh they're fighting i'm i assume they're all different teams then maybe he's got self-res gas is closer i'm not seeing him move he's just gonna be in there probably res now he dropped down right there what okay found him down him in the front they got snipes on the roof as well he's looking at me are they yeah yeah they're right there sniping oh behind me oh shh the other side of the bus i think okay he's just yeah he's just getting time you want to push on that you might get sniped there stud he's going to be ready he's going to be ready i'll be right did you get the guy behind yeah you finished the guy down here oh everyone killed the guy down they're still on that roof all right and i busted the other guy up that was in there because there's gonna push soon yeah let's move yeah i just leaving the healer another place i think it's two different teams i think it's two different teams i wonder if they'll run along this roof above us because they could just glide down and shoot down on us make sense they might just well they wouldn't be on this one i wonder why they haven't gone yet well maybe they already have maybe let me get on i'm going to get on this roof i'm going to get on this roof and see if i can get an angle just to have some height and i can always parachute down yeah i'm going up as well i've not shot at anyone with this uh new smg yet it's quite good for the top over here i think oh [Music] you're that or they're getting shot at up there no eyes on them no eyes on anyone right here they're running across back here to the past that's probably them yeah it's an explosion explosion yeah there was an explosion down here yeah behind us more plates here more plates here yeah i'm good for now got some body armor i just know jacket went down so that nobody what he had left i don't see anyone i see them in train station they just went inside now all right i finally have what's called ammo no what'd you get that's weird i found it on the ground impossible a little trophy system there right they've just rezzed over here jack all right that would probably be the third guy yeah they're fighting on the roof now playing on the roof are there ropes to get up on top of here so or no people are fighting over near fire station it sounds like i'm gonna just drop oh seagulls should there not be a there should be a rappel here or something or there right that would be nice yeah i don't think there is there no they are up there on fire station oh you mean they are still fine they will be fighting until the world on this roof i guess and just see what we can do with it i want to light some of those people fighting behind you all at 240. okay i need to use this n94 man i want to get some kills with it that's where i'm at too nice shot go on it behind it find the box he's right there a bit concerned about that train station live being there behind hmm drop in yeah we just look look to the right people are fighting in the hills directly in front of train station north uh there's a grenade launcher here got a launcher here it's pretty big there's a satchel in there there's a line right here oh stopping power zip line right here in front of me to go back down go there come on walk over here oh dude i just want to give it to him we're in the safe zone he's gone inside i think somebody's been right here in front of me do you need help there chris jump off the roof in trouble one's down um they're going to come back for a friend so i'm gonna finish him out [Music] i think they dropped they did they jumped off the side of the right to the right amazing i'm being shocked yep other roof direct north see him there he was there on orange monica 340. they probably got a shop over there that's why yeah they're gonna go probably by anders they're right here okay oh dude let's get him demon well he is in there you want to jump on the roof on the back side he's on the back side he's cracked nice he's done too late we're doing it okay this is the circle probably that team wipe nice job another one over near uh yeah train third fire station hey bailed and he plays dead there's a satchel over there with some wait yeah i know i need i'll do it i've got 11k what do we need to buy i'll buy it sell presses uh plates get sell presses i think the way buy all the things there you go there's money thank you and jack dropping your money there you get i need plates as well jack yeah you can buy an extra set is that enough or you can buy a box okay no i need more anymore how do i spot it got it good job all right where'd that one uh they're gonna sound parachuted in direct north 30. could be the guys on oranges are yeah yeah they've got a brew and we are finish that guy i'm taking fire [Music] you're on that wall right there live ping ted oh god that hurts i'm gonna die where's that from yeah he's that great wait wait wait wait wait bipodded go to the right all the way to the right yeah he's mounted up on a wall all the way up by the hanger that was a fun game another one let's go you want to do some mini mini yeah let's try it's really good so what are we doing mini right now basically imagine it's just the end of the game every round right you just get your load out like within two minutes and then you just start fighting very nice is it trios yes trios can't do quads or anything okay this is going to be fun so there is loot do you need to buy anything in minis you do okay it's exactly the same as normal but the circle just starts small right and then you have 75 players okay uh i uh i'm i'm not thinking i'm thinking the uh the a 94's damage is way too low it's it's lacking something isn't it it reminds me of the ak a bit but it's got the thing is the aks are just uncontrollable but this just doesn't down people you just hit them and hit them and hit them they just don't go down over there thank you for the 10. what's up mika how you doing what's up justin hello chill cat alison wides what's up hey sam bennett how are you doing thank you for coming along tonight guys matthias how is the visibility on people when you have it on low it's really good yeah you can see people very clearly uh jada thank you for the two got a couple of new members as well eric serpent i think it's it phil thank you reaction to season five i mean i'm excited it's pretty fun so far i need to learn the new map areas and figure out you know what you can do with the train get some decent bills for the new guns and then we'll do a couple of videos uh no problem serpent thank you nick i'm glad to be your service ala reza thank you hope you're doing great man it's been a long time you haven't uploaded multiplayer videos i mean these this is a multiplayer video isn't it right now hey mindset what's up tim walther slothalicious how you doing m4 or m13 switch i'd always take the m4 every time so is it the same size map sod no no so it'll be a much smaller circle you'll see it's the same map but just the circles will start like in an area okay like circle three i think you just can't see the circle before you drop i guess nah contracts uh yeah there's contracts i think all right i think uh talent lincoln thank you what's up eric the real fight begins now just make it 30 seconds okay oh it's a tiny circle we could go straight train station for the meme it'll be hell yeah we're already in gas do you think this is a gamer that they will just test or continuously keep in the game well they won't will they it's just going to be an ltm a bit of a meme yeah oh we are in the game but if you win one it doesn't count as a win in your stats even though there is that's weird isn't it yeah it's a bit annoying i'm going down all right so only 75 players i see maybe we should do like an alternate one here jump on blue okay so that way we just don't drop on the biomass on the hell targets mini oh go here i don't i'm gonna go a pistol down nice damn one there's another one come inside okay hold on same location okay looking come on come on stand him down i was trying to beat him out by shooting his teammate his butt was exposed his butt his butt it's got the so when you go in here now you're met with this locale my i don't people haven't looted this down a bit but they might be upstairs where are you chris i'm on the roof above y'all all right there's more teams up here we've got plate box is that yours yeah yeah i'm dropping into you striker i don't think i've ever used the striker in war zone ever in the history of ever it's pretty good i'm gonna young right loadouts will be coming in in like a minute i think that quick plates up here tons of plates [Music] try outside okay oh yeah yeah let's go for it oh it's already down yeah what's this this is literally the cdl champion for okay well so it's called that's good there's a king out here enemy mark how do we gotta go yeah we have to go down staircase yeah we can just we can we can parachute we can might be people on our roof today there are people that were on the roof no stock i don't know how you got over there oh never mind i see no no eyes there's a vehicle just drove past our loadout probably grab theirs i have an ammo box for when we get yeah i'm going for load up all right i'll try and get a kill with the uh iso in this game hmm try and get kill with one kill i've not even hit anyone there it looks like the r99 from apex kinda yeah yeah it reminds me of that i'm gonna get on a roof and see if we can snipe anyone but the question is what does this remind you of what i need recon on my position there you go several samurai movies i would say hey good job your favorite gun that's a tree yeah okay so we've got a king on the opposite roof yeah oh okay get ready i mean already yeah yeah i don't think many people would stick around though would they well if it's only a couple because remember this you have to wipe full teams there's still 25 teams left i don't think the teams will be even fully wiped yet at all all right here we go this is where burst fire mode comes into its own this kind of distance right definitely this is where it's overpowered i think he's no he's in the front right he's just sitting in one of the cubbies yeah and look at that look at the play account six people went up a bit yeah it wasn't many there really no one behind us on train station now i kind of wish that i picked a sniper class someone just beamed him there mark let full team relocate i'm a hit do we head over there no you don't even hear the second bullet it's 1500 rounds per minute a second brother if they are fighting they're fighting right here so here see if we can win with our silly guns hey silly guns let's go dude fight an mp5 okay without this one got a kill with the iso oh they got fouls as well careful oh god he's got bruin on me he's done ah okay we got him i got him yeah yeah yeah we can go into the shop oh that was anakin skywalker it was let's get to that shot [Music] i had stunned him he and somehow he still turned 180 degrees and shot me i want to see if they just come back in here what's that for me okay right on me right here let's move it come on actually i'm blue somewhere got him he's down he's got tried to stun from the center right there that was me that was me that was me i'll get you somewhere if playing push the jack it's not pushed yet dude it just doesn't have any damage on it i'm not pushing these guys not 2v1 pulling back he's falling back mom being one he was there at the gas tank yeah i know uh can we get chris let's get christmas that's why that's why i wanted to go that way because that's where the shop is there's one behind us yeah let's just go to the one behind it we've beaten them a couple of times but i think one more beam and i'm dead i wonder if they have the damage someone's just rest in the back okay i am ruined i think i'm a little bit ruined where's the guy that showed me no idea goodbye [Music] [Applause] gonna go for that shot oh stop goodbye i'll just get away with that i don't know that is a good question especially in reverse don't i don't know i'm literally facing him but he's still got a good way you only got one player all right i'm just gonna i'm just gonna go for the shop whoever's on the top no i can't even i like how it's in between twins as well literally not even worth it there's 100 a team above you above the only buy remaining oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] i did it very slowly as well lovely thank you all right let's even get some cash quick i'll stop on the roof did you actually see anyone should you see anything yeah they didn't even look at me together if we get our money together i don't even know how i didn't die through the first fight just wanting the staircase on the side i can't do anything dude oh no no it's just one i think but maybe they got ghosts still because yeah there's more than one okay are you ruined no i'm okay i'm okay okay i'm in there they haven't seen me yet i could just be below them hey let's go on the roof oh sh ned okay start what's happened what's happened no i'm coming up with the stairs okay the old-fashioned way fire i think the guy that killed me was the the dude on the on the stairs i've got plates for you got places oh sweet thanks let's go in it quiet beautiful okay jack this is this is this is the win of ages what's that scar there's a guy aiming right at us jack we can't be oh we don't know he's aiming the door well he's on the other side is it you know he's aiming at the door from wherever you want from the other roof okay copy your mark actually he's not anymore have you got any spare ar almost thought hold on hold on no i didn't pick anything up oh for goodness sake i've literally dropped three ar it's just gone through the floor and one is it not on the hit one i don't know it was it was here it's just disappeared okay it fell through the floor most likely opposite roof there movement right there yeah he's right there behind the square and the other ones by the way if you crouch i think they can still see this of their head so all right adam which is exactly what just happened to that guy yeah here you go we're gonna have to bail let's just go there's two down now okay yeah we're gonna get better positioning from this oh my god there's a full team in there thunderstone is done it's done him stand and stand him semtex oh dude i've got no i'm stunned i'm stunned are they with you where are they they're in that room all three of them you still got two c4 yeah i know i know i'm not gonna move can we get on the roof i've got no plates i don't know i'm going upstairs i'm going upstairs so they're ground floor yeah they're gonna float in the room i think there's people upstairs i'm in such a terrible position here i'm upstairs right yeah but i can't get upstairs there's no way like headshot one that's just dead forever oh you heard you heard the other reason that's good one down and one down another one on the reef keep it up team wipe was that i don't know oh yeah you know i can't beat that he's down mate just go just go go go go geez no there was no way there was no way that is really intense it's good yeah yeah that's fun every round lasts an average of 12 minutes i think let's do another one of them yeah i'm about it i got um i got pooped on by the guy who was stunned but yet decided he wasn't me it made me feel real good he ignores the stun yeah he he cares not of whether i'm whether he's done or not yeah i don't know about these new guns but i don't hit marker machines yeah they they definitely are feeling a little anemic i mean really it's still brewing and foul isn't it like until they do the weapon balance that's it an mp5 mp5 still got here god to you have you seen all the uh easter egg stuff with the key cards and the elevators i've tried i did one just normal key card room i haven't seen all of the stuff okay there's like some rooms in stadium that you can get into apparently and one of them has a computer in and you interact with the computer and it flashes up ciphers like little symbols that were in black ops zombies and then numbers okay but no one's figured out what to do there hey matthew what's up bart iron how are the new guns i'm not feeling them for war zone honestly i i don't i feel like every firefight i've been and i've been at a disadvantage if someone's got like a a bruin or an m13 or a growl or whatever or a foul yeah uh warzone plus modern warfare is like 220 gig now it's mad liam thank you so much for the 50. you're a massive battlefield fan and i've been watching you since around bf4 well liam i know this year isn't going to be that big for battlefield but next year i think could be strong preparation could be really strong you've been tearing it up with the origin nine yeah the origin is great man did you see my video bob a few weeks back about the origin it's great oh wow that is the zone isn't it that's horrible should we go uh promenade here yeah okay and then run in wow is that a zone is that what that's called i think so chris yeah it's called the bone zone that is the bone stone right there that's boned already you want to get bone come to the bone brother at least i gave us all three of the uh three of the buy stations there [Music] um i considered the the death i was about to have sniper rifle here it's not perfused on more sniper ammo as well what is he doing he's trying to shotgun me from far away please get a gun that'd be great i also have an ammo box is that russian remember no russian it was my disgusted whatever shotgun i've picked up this one i know that one is it the vrk it's the double one i ran the 725 for for like a week and that thing actually was slapping kids it was great i loved it jack became a cat gentleman i mean that's how it makes me feel stuff oh someone's sniping me from over here nope well i'm going to use the shock and if i die oh what one more in there he's down i am i'm kind of safe but he has an angle on me he's on the corner of this room right here moving up there i'm never using that shotgun ever again guys you could probably get to me if you're quick there's people pushing my body don't worry about it they're underneath me right now they're underneath me right now i i'm know scared i'm never scared oh my god oh my god you did it i didn't realize you were behind me i ain't never scared there's still one on the side oh you have plates okay yeah i got it all right i got that back how you doing okay it's just pinging my door he's at the ac unit on the outside or he was yeah just hold this just hold this pan no one wants to beat each other that's okay a loadout is down and it's outside earth inside the zone so should we run to jack let's just run to jab we haven't shot jack we just we just walk away and get our loadouts we just have a gentleman's agreement and not everybody shoots me okay i don't know what happened to them what a weird fight okay you know what screw that thing oh you're using rni no no screw that yeah that thing's awful i thought you were talking about the 725 no no no it's good dude it was absolutely tosh in that was it was it slug was it i don't know i just detest everything about it i mean i'm so stupid like i just want to get a 94 but right keep picking it there you go king dude there he went left he went left running around left is he going to peak this gap here because he's a little sneaky i'm not playing i just see him me too come on sure surely we can one bit three is it just one it is just one yeah i think so far what's he doing he's sitting inside of a plane he's there or is it just one because he's being he's being very ballsy about this i feel like this is a bit someone someone just sniped at me i think i'm gonna flush him out he's on fire oh good he's on the back side now there's multiple in there wow got the other one it was a bait it was a bait here's the brush stroke if anybody wants to die while trying to shoot somebody i've got one plate i can give away there you go i'm pulling three roll press one in chat to enter the giveaway uh i'll nick that then please there you go thank you kindly there was people there's there's people fighting on this hill right here coming right on that mark let's go come on come on come and come come on okay here we go burst fire let's go this one he was self-resting poor lad someone on the left right one there moving across on blue it just like what's the point of it what is the point of this goodness where's he gone where's this last he's probably dropped low right here hey as it was one going over it's it's designed for mp isn't it it's not designed for water yeah probably like you lagging it's very design multiplayer i hit him twice oh okay all right i got the idea i get it i'm running away people fight shooting behind us i don't know what they're shooting at there's this guy they're still on the edge is his own pushing them yet 20 seconds okay i'm gonna break i'm a break okay it's the best gun in the game fine bye bye yeah i'm dead instantly die another one on the center of the creek one finished another one's pushing me oh that's you they just revived somebody yep they just ride the guy you downed over there on orange yeah teamwork yeah what a weird fight that was i guess one guy like flanked us there yep uh you got a man oh they had bruins of course they did i've got plates for everyone slicing okay there's a satchel over here did you get the finishes on these guys yeah moving here yeah yeah they're all done it was all the same team just okay you got it two plates uh uh jack where do you at buddy i've got three okay i'll drop one drop one yeah i'm what are you having three now we're good oh okay yeah cool i also have an ammo box yeah i'm okay for now king and people fighting right there um we shouldn't say the best [Applause] i don't think you're supposed to use it in burst fire mode though oh my god get to that get to that buy station immediately there's a guy respawning in right in front of us too okay there's a guy right here i just like burst fire because it's cool okay he's down he's probably got more people coming in from the zone more people coming in from the zone you see him stop there's one mark mike mike i mean there you go i'm okay i'm okay i'm okay where is he to the north hey that team is not good [Music] okay dude yeah we get it there's a team right in front of me on the north they just like instead [Music] hey let's go on the train and just leave the map if you want them yes yes yeah do you think one of them is cheap yeah uh he he tracked the whole thing down on irons for the m4 all the way across the line enemy vehicle he's a sniper he's probably got sniper that could be the hacker i don't know do you think there's a hacker i think yeah i'm just saying we've got nice cover here that's the only thing zone's quite far okay let's push yeah you haven't been shot yet so okay oh beaming but he hasn't hit me yet hasn't hit me armor box trying to get eyes trying to get eyes started come to me he just tried to shoot me from over here jack i'm blind we're gonna have to down some people here on the way jack hello hello nice one dude are you [ __ ] kidding me i think i heard someone in that building stud i heard footsteps here maybe in here head now are you bloody am i uh uh i'm upstairs oh there's a guy up here yeah got a bit he's chasing me i don't see him stunned he's upstairs he was upstairs he had a he literally hits the head shot me unfortunately took away all my armor stunning now he's hit on stun i don't know what he's doing where is he i don't like this dude he's hit the bottom floor what he's on he was on the bottom floor he's like a ghost he's just creeping around he's just crashing around got him oh my god wow why why why are we what are we doing we're dead we're dead yeah we're dead yeah we're dead nice knowing you started come on down one down one down one let's go let's run left and hope for the best is there someone hiding in these woods yeah probably i'm still i'm sticking with burst fire mode from me oh god jack oh god there's gotta be someone on our left they're not starting me yep being bean bean beans i'm okay i'm okay bringing down them oh i'm down yeah high left i knew it oh i've been i've been beaten yeah i had to stand up because the guy was gonna snipe you and then that's the one that's the one who uh who instamagged me they won oh i can free cam you can free camp what i can free camp oh dude spectator mode let's go yeah i quite enjoy that mini royale i don't agree with the fact that it doesn't track your stats though yeah i mean it's not exactly um very casual isn't it no i think a game mode like that it should it should track wins and losses and kd ratio and everything but it's just as competitive as the main game mode right uh normal lad back to normal yeah let's go normal again okay i might just like use normal guns now i i feel like i'm over them already although i don't think i've given them a a fair shake especially the iso i like the i like the iso yeah um it's still still not perfect i'm still working through unlocking stuff on it though i'm at 34. yeah weird tiger did the broom get nerfed no it didn't there were no weapon changes in this patch apart from the famas i think but the bruin and the fall are definitely on the chopping board hundred percent use the fam ass do you want me to use the farm ass for a laugh oh i need to quickly build something i'm not gonna have time no i've barely unlocked anything on it oh god what is that fat ass pill gonna be i don't know if i should i don't know if i should what's up nicholas can i make a video on my setup nicholas my pc hasn't really changed that much since my last setup video which was i think it was march last year it's a white case white corsair case i900k rtx 2080i graphics card 32gb ddr4 i've got a couple of nvme ssds in there as well but my audio set has changed i've got a go xlr i've got a sure sm7b mic i use a different mouse now use the logitech g pro wireless i think at the moment my office isn't really an office it's it's just a room with a with a sit-stand desk and a couple of computers i need to actually put furniture in it and decorate it it used to have a lot of furniture in it but i didn't like it so i just ripped it all down but i think when when i've completed my office i might do i might do another set of video we'll see in your position they fixed the right headshot then apparently allegedly right i mean it was working before this patch too okay where y'all want to go uh stadium yeah let's do it okay i might go for a heli again okay i'm gonna try to actually find a gun when i land the first round and one in this one i've got to chop it there's a lot of people here jack watch out don't rush into each other that one i got two oh this is a good man i'm gonna die there's a guy down here oh you're inside i can't save you it's okay i sniped one busted another and then got punched by a fourth not even part of it oh this is too much fun this is too good there's one attack little rats dude get him squash him you get him can you get him jack yeah we'll go sniper now we've got sniper down below where's the sniper oh i'm being sharp where you've been stopped from uh down here oh yeah i see him i've seized it i see we can't get in there i think we've we've cleared everything yeah all right let's we just completely stayed here behind me being uh no he's inside he's already getting beamed from there's a guy down here as well the guy down ajax someone else is coming back to you guys oh oh yeah c4 did he you must have yeah you're coming in hot he just picked up he literally just picked up c4 okay i'm not lying yeah i think he has anymore do you think he's aimed he imported the c4 i'm not even kidding why did he headshot me with this block do controllers have aim assist on c4 or anything jack can i get a ride yeah sure kind of stuck up here i'll start dropping it is it okay i don't know where he's gone did he just quit uh you wouldn't get a kill still i don't know if i had two or three stop were you ruined no no the the the goo lag was fine it was the guy with the c4 i'm pretty sure i think you should i'm pretty sure yeah all right he let you put it to the c4 and then went 90 degrees what the what just happened i killed him with the raven all right and he said what the i mean with it being a raven and the sounds that it just made i'm not surprised all right so flying around in helicopters at stadium is fun but it's not conducive to making money or winning the game uh why they got to ruin everything we love i don't know chris i don't know uh we need some cash someone's coming in oh they got a helo yeah they just stole your helo how dare they pretty rude of them i'm not gonna lie i snipe him i am very upset they keep putting ebr's on the ground there you're kind of garbage yeah i'm not a fan of that i am oh we can get easy money here easy money uh we got enough chris let's go okay i'm gonna drop my money i'm gonna try to get to the top and give us cover i've got a odin with stopping power which means i basically one-shot people beautiful we'll get the boy's study back in the game he's now 500 off uh this some plates dubai if any of you need them yeah i'll grab it i kind of want to see oh there's a repel there i just want to go like check that out yeah the repels are really cool there's a buy over here respawn repositioning just got an armor plate box do we need that yet or should i keep it uh keep it i've got five plates all right i'll drop the daddy there if i want that let's get bounty okay i'm on the roof above the daddy to engage okay so is this gonna is this gonna be a great example of how to use repelling onto the bouncy is there even a repel or are we going to die instantly well the lines are still you know you're going to get stuck on them there it is there it is oh no it's not where is it over there is there one for this building yeah there's gotta be watch this be the only building where there isn't one it's not on this side oh he's jumped off anyway maybe it's on the one nearest the shop is he jumps off yeah he's moved oh it's because he knows we're coming so he's just now he's just gonna switch to the other building and he's gonna go up that line unless he's on here racing to the top you can race them to the top i think he repelled up the building and then he's jumped up again where he just kept them running yeah there you go repel their jack someone dropping in you should be like it should be a smooth transition where you just like hop over the edges he was almost dead too [Applause] [Music] jesus christ that was a good shot okay one guy dead [Applause] [Music] nice shot [Applause] yeah it doesn't let you shoot for ages when you get to the top of those things are you going to try and go upstairs i'm not going to cry i'll see if i can kill him he knows him down there he's just trying to bait me into coming up like come on i'll kill you i promise oh god they've got fouls it's you've got them right you're fine it's fine oh god val val versus uzi i wonder who's gonna win oh someone else shooting you in the back there it is [Music] they're going up the stairs you could take the elevator okay what was this it was just ring around the rosie you were killed by stoney met stoney's got your number have you guys had any server issues today has it been fine uh a little bit like no building i had any server issues but i've had a lot of like frame drop or like uh game stutter stuff okay um but i think it's because i was testing some of the visual settings and if you turn on um if you turn on ray tracing right now and someone calls in a uav in standard multiplayer your frames drop light to 20. that's good yeah so working is intended you know normal things but other than that it's been fine this is for quartos yeah bucket salad yeah yeah how did that happen i don't know i click wrong i guess you click wrong i click wrong i got so many dots i'm trying to chase down there we go that was the last one that rose skinny it's pretty scary isn't it yeah imagine if she was okay it's 3am you wake up suddenly it's dark in your room suddenly you turn to your right she's just crouched in the corner with a foul right that'd be pretty creepy i thought the foul would probably get me first yeah that's that's what you really want to watch out for um say well at least it'll be a quick death that's a meta cod warzone joke that only applies to the last like three weeks that's why i appreciate that a lot of stud yeah wait we got another randy why are we what yeah it said three or three though maybe it's maybe it's just a bug it's a like a lobby book yeah i think someone just like popped in check your gear weapons yes hey do you notice that like some people have like a shadow trail behind them yeah i think that's the people yeah if you use shadow company skins uh okay you have to kill them in that in that song if you don't kill them in that song you have to let them kill you did it [Applause] vengeance i want to do the takedown again i want to do the raven raven is pretty top notch how did the raven just picked his eyes out but he's wearing sunglasses that didn't work working good is that okay what you want to go stadium again i mean where else one halo can we see if we can find a key card and go in one of those secret rooms yeah we can do all right wait at stadium or just anywhere i think they're at stadium right yeah yeah yeah try and get another i might grab this heli and then you can grab the one in the [Music] stadium and here we go i've got this one nice get him damn it chris is in there on his own they've all ran inside started i'm sorry here there there's a guy here by the way using the tail rotor works as well contract complete are there more enemies there chris oh yeah there's a lot it's the spicy world i decided to live in there's a guy here marks him marking him there he's in he's gone he's there on that red mark on that red mark he's running back behind me jack behind me there's two is he just got infinite bullets or something i mean let's start here oh come on come on how did that not kill him you can't get anyone i'm gonna go and land by chris and actually try and help him yeah all right go that was helping chris wants to search lucky people you go very dead i got you killing them i just found it all right we need to find a secret room then how'd you get to the like the upstairs bar area was that downstairs what does the key card say on it there's someone near me god i've only got a pistol it just says red key card oh it doesn't have a number on it no i've not got plates either that's the problem i've got two i've killed four people i'm still looking for more people i'm heading towards stud okay all right i want to get like on the upper ring of it thank you i heard it yeah oh here we go someone just parachuted back in i think yeah he's right there guy me coming multiple guys on you guys are meet guys yeah yeah one day okay i got the other one from you it's uh lentils and stuff this one had like everything yeah nice nice dude i swear there's there's a room no plates now uh i give you one yeah yeah yeah thank you that can you find any doors anyway then directly over there near you jack be careful buddy okay [Applause] yeah i'm not sure where it is i've seen a video of it on twitter um but the it's it was there there it's up to the boxes right i don't know the boxes are up there aren't they that's where the boxes are blue yeah that's the i know where it is i know where it is i've been there before whatever by you stud yeah yeah so you have to come over here and then there's like a secret door secret door it's not a secret door it's like it's just a door that needs a key card but i need to see we have to get up here on blue i need to remember how to do it um so there's the stairs found some stairs right here somebody's been here 4k tv wow there we go exciting there might be people up there never in a million years why would there be people okay here we go here we go you found it you found it uh it says enter the access key code oh it's not gonna work no what is it do it no we need a key code oh let's go got a touchpad there might be on the other side no it's keeper keycard i think we need to go to a you have to go to what's called just a normal bunker that's a shame or again what if you need the blue keycard or a different color key card no i think it's it's it's definitely a code because you can't you can enter it usually we can track the other side really fast yeah we can just run around well there is a is one of those classic let's move out here key card card reader yeah come here come in it's just a random door they're just this card reader you're gonna bust in there i'm gonna try i clicked it it goes ding ding ding ding so you ready hit it keep in mind we've got two minutes on that circle no denied it doesn't work with the red card reader damn it that's annoying just since we actually got a card so i guess we could just get in one of the bunkers with that then unless they've changed things to the bunker maybe there's something in the bunkers that you can use to decipher the code i don't know it's probably gonna be something like that you have to do with the uh plunder hmm there's a random keycard door though i didn't need to get right wow that was a spicy life there was a zip line here here's another here's another room i think he got in here you got in here there's a rappel there oh this one's just open it's not open now yeah we've gone all the way around to this side yeah at least we're at the circle though we gotta make it how cool it looks yeah they've done this really well come on my question is has it always been here i just see the man on i see the man in the moon uh meme stadium's completely fleshed out it always has been it takes so long to run around this thing it's massive it's cool though it's really it's really cool but it's also just literally cavernous i mean if if this was a definition of cabinet so then it was you could get lost in it do the other teams exist no i don't think so well we've single-handedly wiped what three of them three teams yeah downstairs there's a locked room near the bars someone said can you use the keycard in it or is it i don't know i didn't it gets crazy there must be a way to get the code yeah i'm really thinking it's another plundered easter egg basically someone said that the numbers are hidden around the stadium for access to the executive suite and what's in the executive space i don't know work it out youtube make a spreadsheet i don't know if they've changed anything else on the map i feel like the vibe of it is a bit different but i don't know if i'm just imagining that what the training is well i don't know like the color palette seems a bit different i'm dead oh i'm very dead where is he unless you can't see him east i don't know i have no idea where he is he's on the hill over side the wall he's got a uh sks with a thermal scope i see him running over he's running over now chiefs no no no no he's running over there okay guy here what was that armor broke the target it's maximum sweat okay i will run is a problem i got a revolver he's pushing you right middle hit him based on that okay teammate was broken uh talking to chris and your return to the front line but if you lose you have to hold here and he's on your right yeah me no no sorry he's in your spawn now jack kobe okay jack do not come to me avoid the loadout so there's no way i think yeah it's maximum swear that guy is a good player the zone is pushing that all right he's on it he just grabbed it so many bounties we're going to the object that guy uh mp7 don't think i can win that with the knife which is sad that was rather frustrating oh two vehicles i'm just gonna head away from them he's acting i think no no we're just chilling i'm just gonna go for that recon over there okay i've got enough to buy maybe i should go here let's have a go yeah you could get chris back i don't feel comfortable winning a single fight with this gun that's my problem what is it there not four all right so it's just like yeah well especially in these type of lobbies uh am i flying towards that wait someone's still oh i'm surrounded where are they at stan coming up my stairs in my room you guys done yet i took one outside lovely they're chasing me kill them chris you can do it one yes one i've got i've got c4 on the stairs that they come up if they want to come up i mean they've been very there you go those are they got ghosts they've got ghosts have you got izakin on the soundboard today so maybe put him on i got the other one busted out here but i'm dead he's coming back in he's got an mp5 oh there it is they got out maneuvered outplayed out memed and outgunned out dreamed out memes foul brewing loadouts those guys were uh jack if we put our money together we can't do anything gg yep oh now we do now we can can you get something to complete that intel you'll have it too that's the hard part yeah i'm gonna have to make a gold star appear in the sky okay i'm just gonna go in the vehicle and get out of here oh he's got the boy next to me okay come to you jack have you not got any zach in today stop i do i've i've had to fight my way out of a i don't care what he's acting on right now my card i'm driving don't you

people around that buy so be careful probably i'll just run i'll drive around go to that one someone just rest on me here we go i'm on you jack yeah this is clear dropping cash there's a guy right in front of his side two of them all of them three people just came out of the woodwork it's full sweat bruin where were they i mean all three of them in the uh in the area there it is there it is that's what i wanted to hear was anyone not using a brewing in that round i don't know no not at all all i know is todd i've never seen you lose a gulag every time i've spectated you you've never lost a gulag we could just quickly reset for fun because this is a very long one i think it will be more fun if you win the goo pack in the sweat lobbies in the sweat lobby yeah if you get anyone to fight that is well i will don't you worry yeah just wait for it to say like three seconds and it'll be like prepared to fight ah insta that was that fight what's up friends how are you doing thank you for

yeah mini mini that's fine but one more game let's get the win okay the dub man it feels like uh it feels like everybody's been super sweaty today this is the first day of the update it usually happens is that how that works though i didn't realize that well i guess because only the sweats bother to download the game super early so then you end up with because everyone else who's on pleb internet only gets to play the game in like two days yeah they leave their computers on overnight so in the morning at nine o'clock boom there it is uh rosac yeah you can inspect your gun now you press i on pc i think it's one of the d-pads for console you have to hold d-pad down or something that's the rate of fire so does the growl the cr max does more damage oh yeah amex is six bullet minimum killing for zone i think something like that um it does more damage than m13 but everything does so an orange shotgun what minecraft and an orange pistol yo this is setting people on fire that's my favorite yeah dragon's breath uh eight set or what is it 860 on this i love dragon breath rounds super useful for uh peaking it puts a dot on them right yeah it doesn't does 30 damage uh does 30 damage straight to him over time or uh it's like it's like 22 if they have eod again i guess if we want safe or train station train station oh yeah okay cheeky little train station if we go to the spice station if we go train station let's go north afterwards rather than west i don't want to push that angle again because it's kind of horrible well there's everyone it's everyone there mate
