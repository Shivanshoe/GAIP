and bounce off other walls to tie it together i like that that's cool i can't get up there in there yeah find a row and get the transmitter to be fair is it through this door maybe or it says exit um no no what are we looking for it's the final one on the parkour thing jack for a knife i can hear someone i hear him there's a body here on this look full players oh no sylvester there's a grenade though laggy thank you for the 50 it's very kindly [Music] you survived he's alive i thought you were dead they [ __ ] wish you'll pull through bro just hang in there hell i will the transmitter that said you have it i do you can't lose it aiden you can't even don't you like you should wait for that potato metal i promised you what tom you're withdrawing from lieutenant why did he mention it it's just i was fine until he mentioned the potato don't let my boys be forgotten if you see a fallen man please take his tag they deserve it son here dad the transmitter that's your dad he called me a son didn't he oh god the death's there oh one last thing here's the potato is the potato as well [Music] nevermind there was too much parkour do you have to actually go up here think sir it's almost someone's got it here i mean i don't know if this is right [Music] [Music] how are you doing today i'm about to run out now oh is that what they said was locked yeah [Music] probably the way oh zombies yeah what they're here hey what are you a big fan of the the double kick kick as well oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the way i do have you locked it up yeah yeah did you get frank oh man oh it's crazy don't leave me here but when i was actually coming in useful oh [Music] you think you can permanently unlock this wait wait guys i got up here it would be cool and maybe it's like an end game thing i got up the the bit with the ladder was coming by using my zombo guy oh fine is that fine yeah i hear zombies is that no i don't know if it's fine fine hopefully that doesn't happen again that big yeah aidan hayden i've got frankie here at least what's left of him where are you wait i dropped the ladder down guys look on the left yeah let's go let's go it must be unlocked did you how did you do it i um used my sticker mode do you run out yes the 30th floor the infected that's cheeky start i like that a lot yeah it's really shaky but are we supposed to go down here either way it's going to wrap us back around or it's just another alternative room i'm sorry or were we never supposed to go here this is here for a reason i'm not going through it i'm opening it i didn't see that at all but why why would they make his car here then there must be something secret there is an up thing here it's just another route to save come here come here no way all players required yeah spam f oh now wait why there we go oh baby here we go [Music] it can attach to try to use it to get onto the terrace let me know once you've done it okay i see i presume that we can make it you have to make it first grappling hook allows you to swing on various objects and traverse more efficiently it's crafting and then grappling hook or what yeah there it is yeah it's just there okay now that's wrong nice i just accidentally threw my uh i said what button is it to do that middle mouse like you would throw a any other lethal yeah if you haven't got now it's an accessory put it in your inventory if you don't yeah hold on why did that damage me i threw an aid by accident oh did you swing tom yeah i'll latch the light above you oh i see hold it down so hold up i was higher than you though i was on the the other take off we need to go through that elevator anyway right i don't need to go up this way i just swung i don't know okay so you can't pull yourself up don't you um you can jump oh wait see this was the way you were supposed to come out this wasn't the way it was just to go up i think we cheated the system of it yeah we too we see what's here okay i parkoured it behind you these ones here yeah and then grappled above it so like not the surface itself like grapple the roof yeah the pipe maybe and then we'll run to grab the ledge that i'm at i can't reach it um if you go up now because if you've got the ladder there's a light you can do from that side as well well back to where we came yeah so the ladder and then you can grapple on the light there's oh yeah there as well uh my channel is saying that you have to upgrade it and then you can pull yourself up nice this game is upgraded that's way easier well okay i'm really janky either all right down this light it's all about the lights i feel like tarzan we love that wait i think i'm getting the hang of it frank we are it's like it shows you where you're latching to all the time as well where to now yeah it's cool where are your headers you have to go up one level from there you're going to go down oh my gosh like portal missions you know there's like here's a room oh i threw a bloody uv light oh yeah that you're in a wall for me i am the wall this goes on good job does it look janky a third person a little bit it's not bad they're doing a patch all need to fix load of bugs with the co-op i think mm-hmm yeah they announced that today all right that's what most of my oh yeah in the background in the back yeah yeah yeah careful when you're right it's a lot i got it decapitated a couple of them i don't know if it helps oh they still explode regardless there's a boom there watch out watch out yeah felt good this guy's actually dead but it looks alive kill the boomers on okay boomer whatever you say they go up yeah and then swing here you just disappear whenever you oh it's not equipped here oh god how did you not die i did die i just teleported immediately i'm behind you now wait i'm just oh sick i don't have to do the jump i threw a knife i jumped and just heated a knife into the sky and then what um is it this way i don't know uh i think stores going the right way yeah can you swing around yellow this way here there you go look for the lights what's all the whistling about yeah i don't know whistling i hear whistling and commotion all right come on um where are we supposed to are we well now what we have to go up so maybe you do a little cheeky one of these oh there it is yeah there's a ladder on the side here wait where are you i'm waiting for you so like grapple to try and grab this on the right hand side play yeah oh i just fell down around maybe grab on the bridge above your jack and it'll be easy to just ye it over work when you're in the water just cancel it inhibitor do you think it looks so weird if i swing the ladder um let's see it i mean it looks completely wrong on my screen i can't see jack's just yeah i mean there's just a jack's a 90 meters away and it's just a green cable you got this start what did you latch on to something i just latched on to the side of the the right wall here and then just where you are let myself hang and then when i bounced off the wall i was able to jump and grab the ladder it just detaches me there what the hell you're holding it yeah i'm just clicking it once oh that's why yeah [Music] it's hard to hold middle mouse i i think you can just wall run as well here [Music] you could do yeah i think once you get here you can just wall run and then climb up maybe yeah still make it look easy i just fell off oh richa russia i think grapple's the best way can you not just pull yourself to it jack from down there what do you mean like latch the top of the ladder and maybe like just grab it from the base no i don't think you i didn't even grab it from the base there's an awkward one that is what i suggest you do jack go to the left side grapple onto the bridge and then from the bridge pull yourself directly to it's way easier the ladder yeah or do the shift jump hey presto chicken dinner inhibitor container we've got the thing now too jack in the bottom left that thing updates reads where the inhibitor is 40 meters that's cool yeah that's because of the story choices we made i think stud i know i think i've got it too yeah you'll have it if you've got where you are wait oh uh elevator that's the container right on the other side hear it i do have a weird bug at the moment where my game is at like 50 volume for no reason five years hang on it's just quiet i think it's not a bug i've solved the problem my logistic keyboard has that like scrolly volume wheel and i guess i knocked it slightly so it wasn't actually 100 volume give it to me or a triple inhibitor of that that should be oh way better i'm going full stam okay yeah full stamp why can't i click on that oh baby problem solved oh wait i have any parkour skills okay do you have points to spend what do i get double jump double jump let's give that one a go you can't spend the points jack no i can't click on skills it doesn't work okay oh i've got to do in the next room or next roof i guess we're climbing this crane huh crane brain from dying from down light one who sounds nothing like aiden oh all players required oh wait what didn't we just leave i was supposed to do a cut scene or something oh yeah yeah yeah what a terrace you bet looks really tiny from here cool now open your paraglider jump and fly to the fisheye we'll see you there what the fishery is the balloon time to end this madness you have a paraglider get out of there while you still bloody castle back then frank i need to go up you said you'd help me better train men than you have died there aidan i won't lead you to your death frank i'm going up this is a mobile driver are you too drunk to realize that my mom told me about your sister she must be dead by now but you are alive and if you come down you'll stay alive we do have to climb the crane [ __ ] you frank we're done here i'm going up damn no choice though no [Music] i'm coming to you wait for me are you what no no we're the one the one you can i don't know if this is the way you meant to do it but it feels like something that someone would do like parkour wise you know there is a steel beam over there it looks like you can but then i don't see how you get up from underneath after that you know might be the way i can actually drop can you rock it yeah i tried to grapple it i'm gonna try going on [Music] you can kind of do it like this doesn't let me grapple anywhere on the crane [Music] but the elevators are still a problem how does it look current i'm on the top of the second tower and wondering how the hell i get back to the main building well stuff's got high enough before the fall they were rebuilding that wing no i'll be a crazy yeah i can hear like weird drumming and stuff find a way look it is the power thing i'm at it's gotta be we gotta make this jump as well though at some point find a way back to the main building stores you gotta get behind yourself but i think it's this i know i mean yeah we literally just yeah yeah i thought i'm supposed to be on this great we don't have to go all players required no i think we're gonna have to jump across jump here look okay so i'm gonna do my shift jump and grapple the other way i don't it's hard man that's difficult yeah it doesn't feel legit to me i don't know if it's the right thing i've done it oh there you go all right um [Music] not like this no yeah start gliding over i think that's what they wanted you to do start like climb up the ladder up then glide yeah but i managed to i don't know i don't think you should be able to climb that ground well i think it's something to do with the beam jack i think you're supposed to grapple onto the beam you see the beam that the crane's holding yeah but that's that's wait a minute you guys know you guys are supposed to be you're supposed to be up with me because there's um yellow little markers there's little yellow but this is the highlighted area oh do i need to come down wait hang on stay out there yeah because we can park her up there from here oh yeah yeah because there's like yellow you can see the little yellow tarps yeah yeah you're in the right place you just found a junky way to get there yeah that's good at breaking games oh so oh for god's sake i just scared the crap out myself i just wasted a shot at my i keep doing this how did you do the game the game keeps on selecting my my grapple hook gadget and i just fired a shotgun as i jumped off instead of crap you know the boom stick oh yeah just fired that when i jumped and just massive shotgun blasting the eardrums how'd you make it up there jack jesus what swing that was yeah you just got here yeah there goes a a shot of my shotgun that took 100 scrap to craft i did i completely wasted mine i mean yeah you made that stud um i don't know i've fully janked everything so i wouldn't i think if we do this jump up and then go across again with the light you could get to the other side it told me so check that i didn't check that room that was next to i don't know if there's anything there yeah a couple of boxes anything good some scrap maybe we're not supposed to be i mean we should have we're supposed to scale the building the thing said find a way yeah i'm just mr we are supposed to be he said in that conversation on the phone i'm going up screw you so the only way up is this way the only way the only way is uh i just feel like we were supposed to do something with that box by the crane first yeah but it's fully janked no the box was just where the the symbol was to find a route but i do think maybe it did to get to the top of the crane but regardless of the objective the objective has updated for us now jack so we're fine okay cool oh there's a big guy in a jack oh yeah he's quite cheap i mean i mean yeah look at the objective jack reached the top of the vnc tower there you go yeah was he rushing me oh god all right so what you need to do with this guy you stay on the the arm that he doesn't have a weapon it's really hard to swing so just stay behind him and you can uh get wrecked like that can't get ruined [Music] him everybody like that oh no bang bang there's things in here hold on there's some throwing knives up here if you give here as well mad kit healing supplies bunny this goes outside which is where we need to go next smoking kills does it that's what the box said items you get that legendary newspaper on the top yeah newspaper how much damage does it do funny funny see all right got to the left now they want me to do more climbing want me to do more parkour in [Music] street where this one you're just swinging lad i think i'm like oh nice yeah i love that i'm accidentally like scrolling whenever i use my grapple i guess so every time i go through it yeah my scroll wheel is like really light it's like a speed wheel almost ah no i nailed it and i'm fine can you not just this is cool i mean you know i was way faster if i fell off right just grapple to it [ __ ] if anything happens to her i don't know i did this for awesome you dropped the ladder for yourself big monster [ __ ] unfortunately i've worn mad and the pk's won't let her oh i see the i see the way they want us to do it near the top already you're going the right way jack even if she did make it it'll all be over by then there'll be a yellow beam they have to cross to the left he's a master free runner of course he's gonna make it that's it oh man you need a lot of stamina for that cheers i'm coming i'm coming just use your grapple as a last resort if you want to make it here we go you do need a lot of stamina did you grapple with it no no i i've got enough stamina so yeah that's how you do it oh i fell off ratio jack try and uh grapple on this bridge behind what yeah it still is yeah i'm going to climb up everything's on the left side wait i i don't have an upgraded grapple and let me grab my grapple if you know what i mean okay let me pull myself up um i don't know what i've done if i just it lets me yeah i don't know it's weird i know you grabbed the ladder there jack can you jump behind yourself there's a bridge there with a yellow thing i don't know if you've got the stamina to do this yeah and then can you walk up that thing ahead of you to the right no no no no no no you're not going to walk up that i can just swing that's cool that they've considered that like rather than just gating it they've gone okay well here's a different way what were you after yes this is the way oh man this is insane new hope what a view huh imagine messages of peace and unity bring in people through the middle of the gap do not forget again oh it's fine i need to spend my skill points as well dude i'm actually getting vertigo i'm actually getting vertigo horrible people do this kind of stuff in real life as well and they film it like absolutely oh no i hate that i hate that [Music] fine come on oh god just throwing the wrong gadget or fired a shotgun randomly oh it's funny oh i almost fell off again it's fine is this a swing around the corner thomas yeah it is don't go out too wide you good nice your guy just like teleported down low so it scared me this is sick this is awesome america isn't the best he's got a good throw on him he's quite accurate never misses i tried to take a shortcut there he doesn't miss oh [Music] getting pretty good at this last minute saving myself from dying parkour stud [Music] yeah follow the trail you see where the yellow paint is dud fine it's fine this is so much fun it was really cool parkour sequence they've had a great time designing this definitely great set piece it's kind of uh plausible too you know yeah yeah yeah no stupid especially the zombies yeah i'll slide again oh god don't miss that this is epic yeah a big game a moment finally a ladder i really did have a good plan uh a solid plan we could really activate this better yeah hell the army used to control that tower it's a bit spider-man that's that's definitely mount what killed me oh well i might need a i'm going to rest jack you're a bit closer than stud hold on i can drop off plus ratio stone would hate this game it's so easy to die to fall damage i don't i think i missed the trash that saves me yes this bag yeah i love that yeah there's a little there's another little alternate route i can see how you fell into yourself yeah i'm trying to figure this out i'm getting sweaty watching this and i need to after yeah i actually i actually am i don't yeah look this is mountain ball i don't get out there yeah but there's a ladder isn't it yeah but what does this what does this mean uh well wait until you guys get up here because i'll see if i can very scary part coming up oh my god you can you can you can what have i found you found a way up to that town but there's no but there's nothing up there i don't think there's anything on there is it not i can see up there yeah there's nothing there's a beam that goes over yeah yeah but we can get that now i think right jack you go first what are we doing yeah we're beaming onto this led like i think we jump onto this yeah there we go and then we shimmy i'm gonna try it one more time look we can get with some i can get it from from here there is something there's something there's a box on top of this one but we have to go afterwards come on hang on it's this way we need your beard there's nothing don't don't worry we can get there afterwards i'm holding pete's fast travel i'm just glad i made it one time there you go there you go [Music] lovely that was an awesome mission really cool i'm at the trailer not over here it's next it's night time now someone turn the lights who turned the sun off and on again it worked oh that was a cool sound okay can i stop now been thinking radio new hope is still an option but it's your choice the way to find mia the truth about her our choices are bigger than ourselves sometimes the things we do i'm not gonna try to convince you you got the transmitter working it's your call [Music] uh who's on the phone to us right now frank give it give control to frank peace one i don't know who one is what kind of music you'd play on your radio station uh don't tell me we made the wrong talking all the time if so i'm changing my mind you [ __ ] i can't believe it thank you aiden thank you so so much you have no idea maybe you'll get off the booze now anything you want the people need this antenna more than you do oh yeah good cool aydah what have you done you'll hear soon enough and let's hope frank's still got it to that truck that's on the radio sneaky snoop back i promise yeah good luck climbing the building and i thought yourself were becoming friends sorry jack i made my choice yeah i don't want to like us again now honestly i don't really care much for the peacekeepers plus uh we've got uh you know we'll be in their bad books when they check the cctv and see me and start kicking chris about like he was a tennis ball frank is back and i've got some more exciting news for you are being collected blankets the canteen all those in need can report to nicholas stay tuned and i'll be back soon with another message of whole meanwhile enjoy the music [Music] yeah just just in case whatever they're playing right now is actually copyright it's fine sorry how did she she was up here already no it's further in time jack oh my god oh my slapped us off the roof where did that come from you owe me one don't do it souls of my sneakers nearly tore off trying to get to you um i'm sorry sorry i thought i'd be scraping your guts off the [ __ ] pavement and you're sorry i don't believe it you were actually worried shut up okay like i said you owe me now kip my sneakers are ruined i can literally feel the concrete scraping my feet we need to get me a new pair i've got about six in my bag sheep hold up a whole building to get to us well that is commitment not that bad to me you sure we don't have more important stuff to do if it was their looks i was worried about i would have trashed them ages ago risked a trickier route to get to your sorry ass faster but the wind blew me into a broken banner [ __ ] spikes were nastier than they looked they were my last pair of intact shoes aiden my soul mates in this dirty revenge seeking business without them i'm look so let's go you want to go shopping for new sneakers now is this some kind of joker do i look like i'm joking you're the knight oh [ __ ] but we just got here you left your back back a bit oh there was a box on the same roof as us on like a little ledge yeah do you mean that area i was trying to parkour up yeah yeah but yeah it was further than that there's a place some of my old stuff might still be there i thought all your stuff was at the fisheye but i guess that's not where we're going just shut up and follow me wait don't jump off straight away she just teleported in front of me she's in my face right now [Music] oh man wait do you reckon we could would you reckon we can just fly over there we started this generator jack or is it just up already sorry it's generator here for the safe it's already started all [Music] right the jewelry detector signal now extends to garrison okay so there's a yellow marker we have to follow her so get yourself off the edge yeah is there nowhere else we can get back up though it's a shame to get up our building we have to do the whole parkour thing again [Music] that's what i was saying though like if you don't do stuff early it's like all right story's over you can't do any of the cool stuff you want to do maybe the cool stuff was up there no it's not not not the area right now that middle building is the dev building if you want to go there the one that jack's like to the left of jack what this one here i hope it was worth it because you lost your chance as a closed address yeah don't worry oh nice there's an inhibitor there yeah and then we need to jump down damn it you have to there's a little parkour sequence you have to do to get down this building i think i'm gonna die here wait where are we going now i'm just following jack zombies here i mean as i said before we'll do the story and then we'll do this stuff we have to um yeah it says 87 meters this way but i don't see it where thomas what's the room zombies yeah that's not i feel like i might be at the right place [Music] it's up in the air is it yeah okay there's lots of vents around we'll do the dev room easter egg some other time is it an actual easter egg or is it a book like is it supposed to be it's a easter egg you get a finger gun shotgun where you literally just do finger guns and to shoot and you get um i can't remember a new melee weapon that's really cool that's how you get that thing or something about the charm um no it's actually it's actually supposed to be done logistically there's a charm you get that adds 500 durability to any weapon you want just once well on one weapon and then once the weapon like runs out of juice you can um i don't want another one how do we take the same yeah we all just went to different rooms i mean i'm close-ish i don't think i can get up though okay there's a way to look if you take if you go here you can go here if you come to me there's a zippy wait i found a hook here i think i found it yeah this is it all the way up directly at the bottom of my feet yeah it goes all the way up to where she is i'll stand on the edge of it so you know i am you see it big blue winch if you look up to the building oh right here stud yeah on me oh yeah i see but the rain looks so good on the floor what the hell look at the ground when you get up here the rain on the ground behind you it's a nice effect inhibited [Music] see that opening apartment two one six do we have to go looking for a large red box with gold trim that's where i stored my shoes aren't you coming with me you're why my shoes are ruined you get me new ones go inside take the shoes and leave and don't touch anything else god doesn't seem fat i'm fine chicken she said don't touch anything else so obviously we need to look around for some good stuff oh you got it nice oh here we go which room is hers what did you say two two one three was it or two on six i remember two one six one money on the map okay there's something in there she doesn't want us to say obviously there was something in the fridge what was it who's food so there's a secret room here do a scan you can see the inhibitor through the wall investigation oh i found something investigate the rug on me okay wait there's multiple things to investigate now then the shoes and the radio guys boots oh here we go we did it reddit cool i wonder if it works the one mixtape well obviously we've got bloody mix oh no this is i'm not like the little one i know she lost a partner did you find them yet i'm sorry i don't see a red box anywhere you dope you're not looking hard enough there's another room more clues about it up here behind the plywood yeah can creep under here guys on that oh nice start yeah under the table jack there's a staircase to the right of where you're trying to grab oh my god it's not you think that's how she goes to bed every night jack you look almost almost happy wait isn't that friend photoshopped i mean uh i don't know maybe it is i feel like she's lost so she told us the story once about losing her man's secret room inhibitor is open okay stop jumping out cozy nest hmm except for the shoes [Music] [Music] with the wine and the view the music i mean i'm starting to see a whole new lawn here and you know what i don't blame this guy whoever he was for liking her [ __ ] you aiden no it wasn't hack on the original photo though but love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of tomb still alive i can't remember i well jack killed him i didn't kill him i left him to die okay die did he didn't see him die we'll see him again give me that for sure please pull the arrow out and say there's a bow here there's got to be more goodies around i thought there was a bow in this area yeah buddy first time i've had a bow in the 35 hours of playing this damn game [Music] you go um it's a level five bird it's better than mine oh yeah i think i'd say it is now i think this store doesn't open arrows there's arrows there as yeah i think it was like 80 arrows she had at 15. bow equip [Music] [Music] nice i think that's it for the apartment yep the story continues the first card game that we played together yeah uh i guess story-wise yeah [Music] it's not many that release really is there no not with this like level of quality all the way through though meet me online [Music] didn't want to grab that game bye i wanted to use my glider please i'll see you later tomorrow yeah see you later guys i'll uh i'll go on foot i'll put her sneakers on and run faster i don't know which rooftop she's on i'm sorry zombie through the zombie zone let's blow that i don't even mean to do that you got the blower on the right i don't see a way of getting up there easily a repel stud this level two glider is so six dogs you can pull yourself up glider or graphic the glider when you press s oh it just pulls you get a bit of height you go higher come on oh it's smoke not not vent [Music] my fps is a bit dippy it'd be long yeah can you fast trouble me just have to wait here i'm human teleportation oh has it started the one just appeared in mid-air for us a single frame floating in the air sat down she's got magic powers well you don't see that stuff in single player like it doesn't fade to black to start the cut scene it's just seamless there she is [Music] drop kick into the fire here i got your sneakers you should also have this into the fire [Music] i didn't realize you and hecon had been together why do you think he's so high on my hit list yeah that makes sense just cause someone reads poetry doesn't mean they don't deserve to die did you guys break up because he abandoned frank or did he abandon him no regrets there's really no point in analyzing that now aiden whatever happened it was a mistake okay i should have never been so naive that's why i didn't want you snooping around for [ __ ] sake you could have just respected that i'm sorry forget we went there how would we have advanced the story if we didn't snoop around true i'm just gonna call her out like that yeah you're right just leave me alone [Music] the one what's going on you just don't give up do you you should know that by now you should know i [ __ ] hate whimpering saying how you feel isn't whimpering fine stick around if you have to but don't interrupt me i'm busy getting drunk no you dork looking at the stars oh the satellites are still up i can see the big dipper hmm aren't you except that's not the big difference this ally is about to crash into earth [Music] it was worth a try though you know any other constellations yeah look at this taught me a lot about the night sky the onions and buildings of stars on the and i'd climb the scaffolding all the way up to the roof frank would come up to tell me it's too cold too late and whatnot but i always ended up telling stories for hours and hours and i love to listen the stars are so clear and seem close enough you could grab them by the balls the dolls don't know balls frank's way of putting it nice huh what about you aiden stars how do you know joe what about me you seen a star up close do pilgrims get their hearts available [Music] more likely the other way around probably the other way around and pilgrims tend to be the love them and leave them type always on the move you will love them and leave in time i'm just pursuing my goal hmm so your consolation would be orion the hunter over there we're lucky to see him because he's not there all year round he comes and goes just like you pilgrim you're making all this up to impress me maybe maybe not are you impressed pretty much um no no bad time now sleep you've talked enough if i see how my not bedtime i'm gonna kill him simple as that sleep time don't try to stop me it's fine quick but you know revenge doesn't make you feel better this isn't for me that's for frank i will avenge everyone who died that night a lot of stars winked out forever hakkon talks big but when it came down to it he bailed on his friends and they died he showed his real face [ __ ] coward you can't turn back the clock true but i can stop his [ __ ] clock and i [ __ ] will sheesh yeah [ __ ] good night eden it's a room for two of us in that sleeping bag i'm gonna be sleeping with my brothers tommo and stodd on the roof thank you on a random couch in one sleeping vietnam this is your friend frank broadcasting yes that's right broadcasting from the fisheye from now on i'll be bringing you all the good news from around villandor helping transform this city back into the community it once was the one the one you there she was a vampire she died when the sun were started [Music] i might have an idea i want to help you aidan fine be there soon yeah if you've got stream mode on it's fine this has been recorded for the game oh good sherry was pretty uh confident all right let's go where are we going just in case he was in the right way because the objective i beard it didn't for me what showed the yellow icon for me i've got an inhibitor to spend i'm only parkour point you want me to buy bye have a great time event on the left i see that then i'm just venting though i want i want the upgraded wingsuit oh it's so much easier though i don't mind having the second one yeah you've got the second sword yeah i've got the second one oh not the third one come in the one come on luan answer me there this game looks really nice at times great i fixed the transmitter and now you go radio silent it's at the top of there tom it's in the main uh complex so if you come around you'll find a skyhook [Music] land where i am the sky hooks here going up time and come up to me as well [Music] oh up maybe my game's ryan got like why is it running like this what if yes yeah like one fps suddenly when i got here i don't know just a specific area i guess mine's like 50 fpa i think well i think there's a bit of a memory leak in certain areas as well should be able to teleport to me yeah guys thank you for watching and tuning in tonight so far first hour done there that was good we're gonna drop the code in the chat right now this is a dying light to deluxe edition code for the epic game store [Music] uh and this is massive yeah i can't remember what causes it but it's something seven fps are you mad your city you've got seven fps right now i've got seven signing off he's not one talk to me frank [Music] oh my god the memory leak is huge look we started off on the wrong foot oh i'm back up to yeah i'm good i'd like to correct that mistake horrid have a drink yeah for me frank i really don't have time for this i have to find another way to find my just listen [Music] he's offering a lot of [ __ ] the joker god his voice goes right through me do i have your attention now what are those renegades yes but how did you the tv station used to be controlled by the military can you bring that more than just broadcast from there [Music] thanks to you we can now listen in on the enemy it appears that waltz is looking for the same database you're after but the observatory is completely soaked with chemicals i have no idea how this gre crap works but waltz sure seems to know maybe the observatory is not the only place to access the database is this conversation all you have for now but if we got close to their position and hacked into their frequency we could collect more intel on what's his plans how the transmission you heard was intercepted near an old military antenna in the wharf just south of martian lane if we activate that antenna it'll boost the signal and we'll be able to hear everything they say every syllable and you'd know exactly what waltz is up to [Music] you broken something oh you're just not going for the players anything else before i get going oh one more thing look at that poster aidan what's wrong with me now night runners used to abide by that creed live by it i used to think we were as torn apart as that piece of paper but the creed still means something and if you increase the range i can contact the remnants of the old night runners some must still be alive i see it now this means a lot to you doesn't it not just me to everyone here but there's one piece missing do you know why i haven't thrown this poster away in all this time why because of luann no when i was margaret for the first time she was maybe what eight nine years old she was barely alive she looked like she hadn't eaten in a year and she was trying to help some kids get a crystal back from the thief the guy was threatening them with a knife he was twice their size stronger and she jumped on him bitty's hands so deep that he screams were heard as far away as old velador after that she gave the crystal to one of the boys and left she didn't get anything out of it she didn't have to risk it i looked at her and thought this is all we have left as humans we can fight one another everybody just for themselves or no matter what we can stand up for each other then i wrote down this credo that little girl helped the night runners become who they were for years and if we are to be reborn we cannot do it without her [Music] okay i'm on my way then go get him i'll be on the radio go get him boys before she became obsessed with that goddamn hit list of hers i'll get ears on the renegades for you i'll find out what waltz is up to i promise [Music] ledge i mean waltz is an absolute mud lad i can't wait to beat him that was a really long conversation oh yeah that's everything start yeah when he went in this is this conversation all you have i was like yeah i stopped at every character in this game yeah what happens to my fps in this area that's mad we can restart and it'll be like double but again is it because i mean you guys [Music] see if there's any goodies um yeah i mean last time we did this i had to restart as well so we'll see if you guys can get back in oh did not work back in yeah it's fine not bigger oh is there an update for the game no i'd like to upgrade my paraglider again but i can't hmm there's a small update oh i've got a small update oh no a very small update yeah but does that mean our games won't be compatible maybe there's a problem maybe yeah i would just just in case because now we just got an update it's it's tiny jack like take you less than a minute okay i'm just gonna restart them [Music] and play a game every every friend i have is on this game yeah there's a lot of people playing it yeah it's still about loads of players [Music] [Music] dude looks like a skinny steven seagal yeah he does were they watching my [Laughter] [Music] we're stream in we are nvidia yeah that's the first time about a memory leak issue um someone told me that what it was it was lucky that a few times is it like the shops or the quarter masters i think if you do them something to do something to do with opening your skill tree or something at some point okay all right i'm ready to be invited back when you're ready yeah just loading [Music] is this conversation all you have is the uh is there a battlefield mobile alpha at the moment or is that just i've not heard anything i haven't heard anything because i did see some like rumors and leaks about it a couple days ago i mean they've got grand bazaar in it so they can't be going too wrong there is gameplay already living in a world where a mobile version of battlefield was better than 2040. i've seen the uh the gameplay you get the invites yep any codes left milan yeah we've got another four codes to give away you connecting oh i see i pick a i have to pick a load yeah you have to choose jack's load i said yeah i've picked one i will take we're just taking um loading we're loading i mean basically when you invite us on the menu screen we have to select your save jack okay it does [Music] [Music] [Music] away away i think i'm all right i've got more fps now it could just be that area oh my god it was after the sky hook for me like it was mad just eating myself off a building there i'm coming oh we need to meet each other in game again yeah i've already done that military machete 92 damage that was easy wow oh i can't create my paraglider hey i presume that there's a repel here okay so what does it do now i see it press shift for boost you got a boost on yours now yeah she's yeah it might fix itself when you uh get into a cutscene and come out of it on the other side it might not be just like lag lag like a bad lag oh god around stamina that's all i heard it's fine it's fine is it fine it's fine now okay we've got some parkour here guys yeah on my way oh you have to wall run that that's cool wow like a forced wall run there i think oh there's an inhibitor container here as well on me yeah i heard that i've opened it up after you do the wall run and go around the corner just tuck into the left and get it oh my god i'm a parkour wizard man i don't know how i do off half this stuff not that way i don't know yes there's a light there's another light there's one around the corner yeah there we go there you go [Music] come on oh i nearly didn't make that i mean this is a really cool building to climb up again i love this i feel like now we've got the grapple hook they're going to do way more parkour stuff that's a zombie there right next to me i found the inhibitor case oh you got it all right all right cool okay we're like in slow motion then that was weird it's fine didn't trust go around the corner with all those lights not just not seeing the one i had to grab onto oh this there's a blue bag out there a blue one a blue bag empty great empty you just get debated a lot in this game don't you yeah i don't i don't appreciate that just don't let me sir well if you if you scan a cupboard before you open it it'll show you the loot inside lots of zombies here start when you jump in watch out where am i where are you just keep going now i've rested oh yeah yeah god you can just crouch all the way past if you want are you already up jack yeah oh god they're right here it's fine it's fine yeah you can crash past [Music] when you go outside yeah oh you need it picking this lock here it wasn't selected though so yeah brock oh i just i've just parked myself up here somewhere get junk a cheeky heel thank you love that how do you know this thought okay maybe it doesn't do that i don't know yeah i managed to get around just swing off it oh dear there you go yeah i thought it started doing it like a different way or something i did do a different way i did yeah star's been doing like the wall run combos i don't think you've unlocked the max wall running out jack uh no i don't think i've got that yet unfortunately you spent any parkour points i've got one to spend at the moment i might be able to get it yeah i get it it's really good yeah like i can get up here which is pretty nice i feel like we're making decent progress for this story we're doing this pretty fast made it had a full i like to the parkour isn't like for smooth brains you know there's a bit of a challenge yeah a little bit am i is this oh i see i'm supposed to get back the way i came i thought i had gone smooth oh i got another katana just another one was about to die i would have a katana tom i've got a spare one there you go [Music] it's purple but i don't think i'm supposed to be here jake i'm just here jack do you want it i've dropped it uh pick it up tom and i'll come and get a woman at the top which way did you go when you came out that room left or right oh my god um do i go this way stop lying around so do i go that way i don't go this way you go back my way i was going the wrong way right i think i'll spawn new i think well that didn't work for me yeah it didn't work for me either i accidentally switched you sure this was the right way yeah yeah jack was coming towards me the other way oh i managed to get up there oh i'm actually the top now i just went just threw me at the top i am confusion let's swing around oh my goodness yeah i just missed the jump i didn't climb up it i found my own way you can go your own way study them [Music] my voice isn't made for going up octaves [Music] um hardcore parkour time is it all right so do this look i don't know what yeah there's a ladder oh god it's timed it's timed don't worry there's a ladder here that's not already dropped there yeah i dropped the ladder i didn't realize you were further ahead there you go jack you have to go this way [Music] and then what uh oh was it saying i selected a ranged weapon for what's i've got to do with anything [Music] guards the hell [ __ ] sir [Music] [Music] oh my god [Music] open my arms wait what where now where do i go up can you go up no no no no no no no you gotta grab again stop i know can i grab yeah and if i can i'll drop the ladder here you missed it just in case something goes wrong there was a ladder yeah we got a dropper stamina i forgot about stamina i don't know how you would do this can you just go up there grab the spinner things yeah you have to grab these things on there yeah there you go i'll wait up here i can apparently just open it all right yellow bits below you grab those yeah the things here in the middle parkour point let's go go combat and a parker once man just about made that turn them on is this higher than the tower no it isn't frank ah i got the antenna going okay let's see thank you for the 19 months how many hearts attacks several several actual parkour course we did they're moving they said they're going to meet waltz heading east yeah my cutscenes are now broken by yourself that cathedral area was super cool tom is that the same cathedral over there yeah that's the one that we found that weird guy in and the big monster drop kicked him to death yeah all right get that uh war on jack where is it it's called tic tac that's the one right uh no wall combo the very bottom on parkour if you already have a wall i don't have enough stamina to get it can you expand in here at the point where i need 260. you don't have any inhibit to spend it's fine i got the uh the wall run instead the um well you run up vertical surfaces yeah i just bought that all right let's go the breeze it's breezy this is nice it's stupendous a breeze and i've got the boost now too here we go shift the boost um how do i get up to the top here then oh no oh no no um wow oh i see they want me to parkour i think or just have a sick uh glider and just get there in one go i'm climbing up plus ratios fighting men power attacks cannot be blocked why is it telling me that because i'm going to fight right now all right kicking everyone off you might see corpses flying yeah um this is a problem my game's lagging now i don't know why seeing big lags being chilly okay everyone's dead i just kicked everybody off the roof yeah my my yeah i got i got i got hit by the debris but yeah also my game's lagging whenever i don't know what it is it's something to do with the co-op but basically whenever something happens it lags that's good literally anything that happens in the game you want to restart again because you can't drop it like we can get you back in let's see if it does it again we need all players to proceed here i need to press this button yes okay why don't we do that and see if it's broken which it probably is but that's fine the cutscenes are all broken as well i can just climb up nice yeah i just uh drop kicked like four men off the roof so yeah yeah oh no no no this does not make it easy jerry key i'm doing it get the meme what do we operate with the military sector uh that's how you do the uh glider and uh upgrade the grapple hook you need the tokens to craft it wonder what the grapple hook upgrades are gonna be apart from like climbing up yourself yeah pull up maybe uh enemies pull enemies off yeah maybe grab an enemy and pull yourself towards him and pull him off i'll tell you what i'm going to restart my game just tell him me and jack can uh restart the game you get you do that cutscene can do it yeah and afterwards i don't know what's wrong with it maybe it's just a certain point in the game all this stuff right debris no no it's like bigger [Applause] [Applause] frank i need to get to where they are you heard the maiden waltz is looking for you he's got a way to access the database i found someone he's too strong for you and you'll be playing straight in do we get it i think if that's the only way to find out the truth and so be it you're stopping kiddo stubborn like the one i'll be in touch cutscene's done stud can you be joining do i have to invite you you have to invite me i think yeah that's the party's open stadium [Music] send invite did you get that yeah well that worked okay that didn't work yesterday yeah just straight out i was works expecting uh restart all right there we go it's feeling better i think but we'll see oh no a bit of lag i don't know let's put down performance or something yeah no it was but it's something to do with when you guys interact with stuff because it started lagging uh i ruined myself what happened on camera stay up use the blue stomach glider what did you like get hit by an enemy or fall no i did a full clip i clipped the side of the building and then i couldn't get my thing out try not to do the same thing on this corner all right let's go that was close thank you hold on i'm just gonna my whole thing is broken the matrix is collapsing something like that i'm gonna restart everything and uh join you in a second 92 meters away grapple with this i guess if your middle mouse it just like oh tom it's quite laggy quite laggy for you now is it oh when you did that it would just okay yeah no i'm leaving now no it's fine i don't know look at my one hp oh my god i was gonna give you a foul it's wolverine time there's a bloody king here as well yeah that's what i was trying to get after i dropped down that's why i died full damage [Music] oh man all right go find old offices on garrison boulevard looking for offices here we go why is there stakes here stakes yeah oh they're spikes they're nice just oh hello defenses in the oh boy he's a big lad tom that's why jack no one's too big for a dropkick we've learned what was right these [ __ ] worries dropping on us first him then we'll get that geo oh my god wow we don't need waltz to deal with you oh good old frank so naive warning people talking way too much got it bye how dare you there's spikes behind you you've made a great mistake [Music] [Music] to use my exploding arrows ready oh sh very great yeah there goes all my health yeah that's a big explosion jack does that actually affect you yeah yeah explosive damage affects me i think there's someone behind me can i get you yeah you did i get away from him run towards me just explode this whole building jack ready for all the frames to go oh no don't we oh yes please let's go zombie mode on yeah you literally just hit them in half yeah you can just smack my back yes usually when fade to black in single player it's not seamless in co-op it's obviously your bodies are all over the place you're i right so yeah waltz wasn't here and they know we're eavesdropping on them i know you know someone tried to tip me off but the warning came too late are you sure you're okay yeah i my infection just flared up the renegades were talking about some gre doctor from the bazaar boss is looking for him too former giari and old velador i'll look into it who tried to tip you off well that's the strangest part it was hack on no he wants to meet with you yeah oh the two of you had met anything i should know it's a long story why doesn't that surprise me hello i thought he was dead he's still kicking and he'll be waiting for you at the church on some paul island he's got the goods on waltz and hell and maybe you know something about lawrence too so we gotta go see hack on yeah and then i guess we'll be fighting once after that frank you're trying to know what happened to the one just remember they're listening to you two will do aidan be careful who knows what hakkon is up to i'm going back to the fisheye there's a lot good luck all right let me know in your next sequence very good now just a big group fight kicking people into spikes drop kicking you know the usual mode um i'll invite you start you're ready okay study yeah i'm ready i'm ready there you go come on hopefully it doesn't ruin it mfs is great in this area but it's fine yeah mine was doing the full just like yeah it's hard pain stutter always throwing those i never used the bottles to throw out the enemies i just don't i never use walls no it's night time nighttime i'm loading ready to be next to you jack sorry i wanted to be next to you uh give me a fast travel option i think it's gonna start joining maybe got you i have a black screen oh thank god [Music] hey oh yeah very still stuttery yeah big starts mmm yeah i've got i've gotten to the moment hopefully we'll get out of this area it'll be all right it's like huge i feel like this has only happened since the update though yeah but we hadn't done the update before when i started having it you know right okay update i haven't actually applied okay 100 meters away you've got a struggle available right not for the bizarre though yeah it's only for metro i did unlock a couple of the metro stations nice yeah i remember because the one stutter i don't know why if you can travel to us in a second because i'm my fps is clearing up now i'm getting away from that area we're going back to the bazaar the bazaar yeah well i'm out of there yeah where the fps isn't so bizarre but it's weird though it's got nothing to do with my graphics it seems to be something else that's what's weird boost is a game changer that i get i can pull up last second then use the shift to speed into the sky and then carry on longer yeah i'm going to get that i said have i mentioned uh lennox we climbed the top of the tower we activated the radio station we gave control of it to frank and now we're gonna go see hakkon because apparently he's gonna tell us something about waltz that's pretty much it so far careful of how this jack i might have triggered one i'm not sure all right oh it's up here it's in the church yeah sorry not the bazaar let's find a way through that trigger in the howler container yeah just wait for the fast travel stud yeah yeah well should we know okay all right let's see what happens and it's fixed fine oh big stutters hopefully it's fine are we gonna have to fight him you reckon yeah we did leave him for dead so well i did in my story anyway this is just full yeah but i mean it doesn't matter anyway yeah i see it i see it too stutter stutter maybe re-host at some point because this is he's tried it's game himself [Music] it's just uh i think we've got to stay with it i mean this is a boss arena isn't it it's got to be no way we've fought no we haven't been here before frank the church is empty what are you talking about well hackon's not here but it looks like the renegades were camped here their fire's still smoldering hey then are you saying why did you want to meet hackon why not it's been a while looks like you've made some new friends how is lawan by the way wait don't you know where she is no but what i do know is that someone's been killing williams top officers each with a single crossbow boat sounds like la one's ammo doesn't it okay pilgrim time to get down to business [Music] he's still on walter's leash i see oh no enough chitchat aiden give me the key what the gre key aiden give it to me [Music] i don't care what you want we were a team yeah things could have been different between us but you [ __ ] it up with the puzzle oh jack you left me to die get that [ __ ] key from him because he liked him why did you leave him he was our friend no betrayal what did that scene look like when you uh left him to die [Music] yeah um oh now it's fine again yes don't need the cutscenes look at you guys is [Music] [Music] more call me logan [Music] just kick him just kick him [Music] guys oh god yep that's the dead man you chopped his legs off whilst he was down let's go up here now yeah have a spear [Music] that's my favorite thing oh it knocked him down there we stood oh hello uh sorry i had someone saying sorry i can't take that on this guy anymore [Music] [Music] nice kick him oh my god like if you do a kick in there you just get stuck in the chain right what the it's gonna stop i'll stomp him oh come on now stop him now oh he gets up so quick kick him he's in the wall guys just keep bullying him there we go he's dead there's another one in the corner get him oh oh no no he's in here oh yeah oh man that messed up the dropkick's even more op in this game than it is in uh oh hi this uh that's alright it happens just deal with it i'm stuck now it's pain all right talk to hack on start why are you like constantly just going i can't i can't i'm not allowed um so many people have died already you can't stop the wheel from turning now but you had a chance to kill me and to take it from me at the bazaar what changed well what do you think kid you promised to get me out of the city we had a deal but then you ratted me out do you think waltz will just let you go just like that you know what he did to dylan to to all the others yeah but they all stood in his way dylan betrayed him you still hear people going murdered him the key is my pass out of the city real [ __ ] shame i have to kill you drop kicks i mean what about what's the explosive arrow again uh jack that if you do that give us some fair warning all right okay i need to clear the area what's he doing waiting for other players before proceeding okay oh now we want to fight him oh because yours finished i that's the lag stopped right interesting so it's like tied to the host's connection yeah yes i'm turning there's a beast mode on against hackon i don't i just want to do normal mode against hack on oh blacked out it's fine what is going on i can still hear people going ah this i've got a raider it's quite buggy what is this dude get off me i ain't as pretty as before he's waving his spear in my face tom we've both seen your biomass oh he's here now you're not gonna find me in time did yours just finish yeah yeah this is the problem okay it's trying i think it's trying to make sure we're all well usually it plays it like i i get out of the cutscene at the same time as jack you're left behind for some reason yeah because i'm like oh no give up we've got to search the church guys we're going to find him i've got to fight this guy yeah i want to say if jack fully resets the game but we've already tried that right i mean i can do it again if you want to try i don't mind that's that's what someone said yeah they said they re as long as you restart your game and the session maybe it's fine because it's like insane have you got a really bad lag at this stage right now no so now it's fine yeah as soon as we get into cut scenes or anything like that oh my god i didn't do anything he just blew up oh you hit him with a bojack yeah i should have uh let me hear you let me hear you should have said something you should have known i was going to fly over your shoulder with a drop kick [Music] i don't even see that guy we've got to search the church wherever he is he's going to be over here um yeah yeah you're right jack could find maybe i don't know she glow grapple maybe no can't do that so do not attempt it that would float climb just walk around this and go up the stairs like a normal person yeah right now it's fine oh you just climbed that like an ordinary person ah right where would he be [Music] cannot go further down there jack i don't know well there's nothing there is that it's just more church more church um more church the new show um uh maybe you swing back the other way and use this to get on the mast i've got to throw an eye out i've got sake oh yeah you're right i think it's a sake i'm just gonna force kill you guys carry on you think that's the right way yeah it's gotta be because we went over the master first time so then you have to get back on it oh yeah yeah yeah it work oh no there's a gap up there yeah yeah yeah see the gap yeah he's hiding in there do i have to use the grapple to get through it yeah no i i got on the top so i i climbed on top of that mask you leap that was if you get the swing by jack um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go yeah yeah yeah he's built different oh god i need i need to remember i can press c to do a roll at the end of those falls i just always forget fine it's not gone we've left the church yeah we've obviously not done it then have we ah forget to say he's hiding somewhere so he's in oh how do we actually hidden that wasn't the way was it going through that gap no this was this is the exit i think yeah is he through that's back into the church there's nothing else here in this bit is there no this wasn't the right way that's the church for a hack on so yeah it's just gonna be somewhere in here i can't jump through that tom yeah me neither mate huh oh yeah they just okay oh god oh god it's fine but it won't be forever how many people have you betrayed icon killian frank lewand why did you betray her frank told you about the tv station told you i chickened out right yep what is wrong about that oh no it was a suicide mission and lawn why did you leave her what how do you know about that just answer the question i made a deal with the devil oh no she had her own hell to deal with what are you talking about i left to protect her if i'd stayed walt would have had her killed so why did you work with him why did you betray frank i didn't i didn't betray frank i was trying to fix things after the tv station i was planning to spy on waltz and but he got suspicious i threatened to kill lawan and now it's too late i don't know how close i am okay don't go for the mattresses oh here we go it's from kick's mine yeah drop kick city drop kick time just don't kick him onto the mattresses you're gonna set yourself a fire tom um we are killing him so fast an explosive arrow hang on get away [Music] [Applause] can you not turn around is that related to the database okay right now we got that gap and i think i know the person he's after i'll try to use the radio to reach you first it's so weird yeah we'll get jacks to restart it one more time and see if they fix it otherwise otherwise you might have to watch is actually insane what's the like how many frames you're getting in the car scene there's it's like never just it's like a huge stutter so it's not the frames it's just like stop and stop and stop and stop it yeah i'm getting that i like our scenes but it's not like it's not unwatchable yeah yeah it's just there's more pure paint and even now i think it's something to do with syncing or something between the games yeah just doesn't work [Applause] have you got a uv light to jack um there's a we're at the objective jack oh sorry i thought yeah we weren't supposed to go outside can we bring him to us i can just come back in this door's locked so can you interact with this door to leave jack the other yeah on the other side all players required to get through this door the wrong way [Music] you're gonna need to park all back through that gap in there i'm on the wrong side here yeah you have to be on the inside the church basically you can't leave the church your own way you have to press p to open the door or whatever the keyboard is p for pay chase ended parker to pick up a passport please forgot how you get in though this way guys the zombies are my friends now so they're chasing you but they're not hurting you yeah the zombie just like stopped me from jumping yeah as you like went for the mantle yeah jackie jack get in so we can leave this is so stupid jump on the mattresses below you'll be all right all right i'll leave i always [Laughter] [Music] the matches were alive i don't think they're those kind of mattress system oh no he's still alive stage two stage two stop hack on you're in no condition to fight yeah you're just blown up and be selfish and dropped so many times this doesn't make sense do you think this doesn't make sense mean nothing to you don't you want to make things right hack on there's nothing to make right anymore the night runners are long gone no no business he ain't gonna raise the dead although it's a nice dream what's really going on here frank told me how you broke with the night runners every day since i've wondered would things have ended differently if i had been there would my friends be alive i know i can't bring anyone back but i did make a vow i'd prove myself to frank and lauren well all the options let's not fight or come any closer and i'll have no choice but i mean it's his fault in it i'd say let's not fight it feels like that's what all right i fell off ratio i'm stuck i'll stomp him while he's down from here he's watching this they're just like facebook you killed him no he's back surprisingly now he's back as a zombie he's dead from the top [Laughter] he seems so vulnerable now no it's okay i've just it's okay it's a serious moment your ex-boyfriend just died i need to be alone for a while there's no way he gets back up what's the coroner going to say when he sees that body reminding him of school days it's got 40 lacerations shrapnel found in every orifice do you want me to re-host that after this so you can say yeah i think so yeah okay there's no problem it's pretty restart the game as well just in case i don't know what causes it it is mental though should we leave the church you can loot him wait you can learn he's got a wristwatch okay let's leave the church first dude what the i don't see his body anymore really his face is all messed up probably from all the uh i think i looked at him just before okay let's jack did get the update didn't you yeah yeah you got the update so maybe i don't know but then tomorrow i had it before it's weird mm-hmm [Music] or whenever there's a cutscene oh i've got some news for you [Music] okay we've got to go across right yeah wait do you want to get to the next bit yeah get the next bit then we'll restart it seems okay now i'm going to drop another code in the chat here guys so the deluxe version of the game on the epic game store yes a good thing this game doesn't have any cutscenes thank you for the code jack pretty sure no problem tom did you just resell it on the market or yeah i just i took it from your chat and put it in mine okay cool cool [Music] you jumping jack like a fish yeah i don't know i'm trying to dolphin my way out you know like i feel like i'm how do you do it and then it just sends you to the floor of the water zombies [Music] to the right it wasn't hibber around there but let's keep going zombies swim what do you reckon guys yeah they can they drown eventually oh hey well i've seen him in the world but stood up i guess i don't haven't i've seen an animation for one oh it's mega lag right now yeah it's something to do with the city it's been absolutely fine that's the problem oh i'm dead it's fine well you're having the cutscene migraine yeah it's only the cutscene like and then whenever someone starts talking yeah but like before we restarted and got the update no no no i wasn't i was actually fine with my fps it's a bit lower than usual and then and then as soon as we started that's when it oh i can never get that c thing yeah just do it right before you land on yeah like did you just tap it or is it like double pressure yeah it's like pain pain i probably don't have it i haven't even bought it it's doing it again yeah i've got i've got four yeah me more of a zebra hold on i can teleport you in a sec warp it's it's i don't know something it's something to do with the car that's awesome we just don't know what it is oh damn that's the wrong way isn't it try meander through these buildings i'm just gonna stay here don't move ten seconds yeah yeah yeah seven six five four three two one zero i've gotta go downstairs my bad okay i've found it i think are you jet i'm here i'm trying to f this guy yeah i'm getting these started here wait have you got a different objective today i'm with frank what what you're miles away yeah i'm 400 meters with frank ours just told us to come here yeah it did get us going and now it's updated let's just reach now now's the perfect time to restart yeah yeah because it will be without i was saying if it if it does that again then i think we'll i'll just i'll just watch it yes that's really bad it's just started happening for you so when i restart which i thought was going to be a good idea now when i came back in i started having the starters for the cut scenes like full pain full pain but absolutely not playable or watchable cheers for the six months kev the chat they were like yeah you uh you want to see this it's like stop motion stream yeah as i said if it's not a problem i can just watch it off that if it does it again you try just dropping all your settings down and just see if it makes a difference yeah yeah i i turned off dx12 and went back to dx11 and that's what i did when i restarted i think this might fix it because it seems that me and jack were ahead of you anyway in the cutscenes i have some stutter but not enough to where i can't get an understanding of what's going on [Music] all right let me know when you guys are ready i'm in the game yep likewise [Music] franz uh why have i got sean connery on my friend's list who's that send invite send him sean connery [Music] please work [Music] i don't know where that goes i'm not going in there hey please please please please we're so we're so close yeah the end of the is within reach you'll feel it where the hell did i spawn i'm just in some random building what is this place here's jack there's tomorrow we're back in the power station tom what why are we here this is where we plugged ever yeah that's why we plugged everything in can you still get that inhibitor of like safe in here then i don't know god damn it don't get out of here forgot there is an elevator though um did we just use the elevator we use the elevator to get out but we get we go in through this door here that i'm going through becomes a lower level all right let me power up the two doors jack you plug in yeah come this way yeah right right it's just like it'll spawn you in a safe zone i had that star store it just loads a city it's fine okay all right let's uh let's speed run it come on is it fixed don't know we'll have to see when they're when a cut scene happens get there fast what's your game like tom that's all right i do i do get starters though like right now in the cut scenes not right now i'm getting them right now man i haven't got any stuff yeah i know that's i think i don't know what it is something to do with i do get them in cut scenes i don't get them in game other than that one area when i went like the the home bases where there's lots of people around and stuff i guess well that doesn't make much sense because there's so many zombies on the streets you could try playing on jfm yeah that's that's what i was thinking yeah maybe i should do that all right i'll be right back yeah do that we've got to make our way to the subjective anyway something's gone wrong gfn's going to come in clutch here 120 fps 4.4 not even sponsored exclamation mark gfn in the chat oh hang on i've got some stutters here i'm all right there there's something something's gone wrong and i don't know why i'll go oh yeah i'm getting these starters star do you talk of oh boy we could both go on g4s now if needs be yeah i'll these as last resort don't want to restart too much trying to get this out of the way yes this place this place ruins the fps holy my frank was in the completely different area to this what the hell oh my god he was like on the other side of the map just stood in the room now start have you been dealing with this yes oh that's what i've been dealing with oh my god jack please go there so i can faster with you everyone's using the gfn rigs because it's so popular after our spot surely this isn't a thing [Music] it has to manually teleport me but the countdown even though it's seven seconds is more like 20. i'm lonely as i said you go ahead i can be fine i think we're missing anything crazy just yet hang on i'm about to teleport yeah the further we've got into the game i think it's become more fun but i also think there's been a lot more bugs definitely feels like they just didn't qa the second part of the game as much yeah maybe it's just a pc port issue the the park orbits are without a doubt like 10 out of 10. yeah i love it i see i guess it was inevitable miserable bastard hack on you bastard i'm this close to drinking again because of you for all the good times and bad yeah let's see if i have the same thing on gonna my down that hole again yeah sleep well friend i've contacted some of the night runners aidan those who are still alive his voice just changed should be here any time i am same one speaking of old villadore you have to get to the bizarre aiden she's waiting for you waiting for me who the gre is a spotty connection what does that just in case we were a queen at once she used to come to the canteen you'll find us somewhere in the vicinity of the church good luck aidan with everything see you later okay right in in we're in i think i've gotta wait for tom's good scene that's fine okay go and do your thing all right again it's my last effort my last try send invite veronica is you good time that's 1.3 kilometers away hang on we can fast travel come on i'm going back to bizarre thank god hopefully fps is better there can you fast trouble yeah yeah we can fast oh god oh my god someone just speak stop stop wait i can't access the options yet we're fast traveling at the moment why did at least valencia all right you're good you're good okay i'm gonna jump off this roof die and hopefully respawn my jackets oh [Music] [Music] don't do anything yet don't touch it yeah yeah yeah okay okay can you fast travel to me now um i need the option if you talk to whatever you need to talk to all right i think i i pressed it as well at the same time and it just messed up pain was there any patch notes for the update um i didn't it didn't say anything you just said just didn't know what i'm doing that was it okay i'm in the bazaar now can you teleport and we can tap on nearby [Music] i mean we should press p when jack talks to someone hold on more people massacred in the tower teleport players there we go hold paid fast travel wait you guys coming here yeah yeah it should be yeah i'm waiting [Music] did you find the music box it's fine yes and you were right because it's waiting for them oh so you sold it we agreed remember i could keep it and do whatever i want with it yeah i can't there isn't a raffle i just dropped the code in the chat [Music] you guys still stuttering then yeah really it might it might come back maybe it'll fix itself because we're in bizarre now actually we should drop out start on that journey invite us that we spawn here [Music] why what do you mean because it will essentially restart the area we're in i feel like because we've fast traveled maybe but then now it's not lagging but yeah is it not lagging for you no not anymore mine is still i'm gonna try and leave i'm running in slow-mo i've got the slideshow mode start wait okay fps is back and i love left but i need to go back in to speak to someone do i um we need to find this lady i don't know where she is upstairs by barney downstairs okay [Music] no barney you know the old man said go tell my son whatever you listen to and i just skipped it away yeah you're supposed to come back and then you see bonnie good for dr veronica ryan you're not the only one man what do you mean the good doctor's in trouble and uh weird kind of trouble you see a group of renegades appeared in old villadore first we braced ourselves for another battle but they didn't attack the bizarre just ask for dr ryan of course we didn't tell them where she is and where is veronica you can tell me right in a hideout vincenzo and a few of our people are protecting her there but the less people know about that i'm not getting anything safer she is where is it barney if the renegades are hunting veronica a few people maybe i'm only getting barney's lines you just can't walk away you can see the subtitles though no the building is north of quarians [Music] waiting for start finish this cutscene it's good now i think we i think it's it's impossible [Music] there's no way [Music] you're still watching the cutscene yes yeah i think i'm i think there's no way i'll give him a hand fully broken foxy i'm the one i was thinking when we leave the church anyway because we're in bizarre now i'm just thinking this is an area you've walked many times why would it suddenly just start though it's weird it's something to do with the thinking the sinking of the co-op stuff i don't know what's wrong with it because i'm fine now sorry i'm busy now i'm on gfn as well by the way stores never cared about the cutscenes anyway so yeah now i'm lagging again i'm all right i'm i'm sound i thought maybe it was my pc but no it's it's yeah that's weird there you go it's fine now i get hot lag it's all right for me though i only have the issue in cutscenes really and the the big hub areas everything else outside of those is really good for me every time i watch the stream this game you're in the cutscene there's a lot of cut scenes in it working yeah there's a lot of scenes it's an rpg though in it like we've been back in this place where's jackie oh wait why are we going this way tomorrow i was just uh testing fps i'm all good though um uh mine's still rude but yeah you know what we had fun and that's all that matters we did it's a shame that we can find a yeah well i'm on gfn as well same thing yeah the gj but yeah good game working against then i'm willing to play through it you know yeah i i might do is just play off stream anyway and then yeah all right go ahead and do it anyway good game guys catch you soon bye-bye so you're not lagging anymore that might have been fine other than the hub and cut scenes i have some stutter pretty major star in the hubs but outside of it like i get 100 fps easy okay it's been flawless for me today i haven't had any sir but yeah it it was fine for us yesterday as well but that's what i was explaining is that people seem to have all of the problems or none of the problems with this game are you inside the grd area are you outside um i just got to get into this building here okay there's enemies here gotta find veronica [Music] see the enemies it's nice to be back here actually yes yeah the city is very colorful i presume she's down here there's a big hole in there in the ground something okay this rain is sick i think why are there zombies in here dude that doesn't make sense can i clean the story like what's going on are they just friends with the zombies well they have their own hideouts like they've got the top level clear and the zombies still have the top one you're right where you are yeah let's get away from him a sec is he dead he's been electrified he's within the bathtub uh maybe in this room lockpick medium yeah i feel sad about start i mean yeah that's a lot of issues in an hour so i don't know why that's happened man hayden really sucks thank god where's veronica miss alberto's son she managed to escape i need to find her do you know where she is now no but we can try to contact her veronica veronica are you safe veronica [ __ ] something's not right yes i'm safe are you oh i am now there is someone who needs to speak to you dr ryan i'm aiden i know that you're being hunted by the renegades hurry aiden more renegades may be here any minute frank told me you worked for the gre i need access to the gre database in the observatory i i have a gre key a gre access key that's what i've been told you think you can let's meet i'll be in a small building near the dam not far from the observatory it's going to be a really good level time everyone in my chat is saying how good this level is okay i'm down soaked in chemicals oh yeah you said yesterday when we're playing thanks for the heads up vincenzo thank you i'm lucky you showed up farewell aidan raiders adam cut they're they that's the old man son who yeah alberto yeah and chenzo the girl the same way zombies i guess yeah through the zombos which are no longer here they're just not here now flat earth do you have a pc designed for gaming and then a streaming pc for capture card stream is beautiful yeah yeah so i've got a gaming pc which i'm playing on and then i'm just leaving it through a capture card to my streaming pc which is doing all the encoding that's why i can do uh 4k you couldn't do 4k on the same pc and play at the same time there's no way maybe in 10 years i wanted some grappling around this place um you know before we get the glider with these vents on the ground they were weren't they yeah uh yeah i think they were but they work the same way though because they don't look the same i don't think they did anything bro yeah even if there's a fast traveler just flown over me jeez sloping it's not far away there's just someone on the roof going slow poke slowpoke yeah he's a uh that's like that's how you get the side quests adrian just chuckled as i pulled my glider he's having fun let me know you can uh pull me off um you might be able to come on i wanted to grab the pole oh it's not for you mr tom there we go the pole does not belong to you you should see me on the pole jack but it's a sight to behold oh yes the helm it's like a kid on this reef an actual child oh i remember this place can't grapple almost killed myself because i have the grapple selected again let's go so weird coming back to these old places where like when you start the game it's so scary and then you've got all these tools yeah it's just fine well we haven't really played much in the night time so have you had a fast travel option yet or no not yet okay still trying to find here inhibit a container this way can't wait to get the glider thomas the glide is really cool where are you i'm near the day there jack meet me and then we'll go i've got my level three that's the place you're looking for it's never on the water he's soaked in chemicals yeah there's a lot of yellow stuff here okay i'm just gonna try and get there as soon as i can but i don't have a fast travel available so wait 200 meters and on there all right sound good jack i almost died there from the yellow stuff chemicals it reminds me of stalker boost is so nice they go off the glider oh my god these weather effects right now like they're so sick around here i'm dead tom no let's see where i respawn hold on it will respawn you next to a a safe zone a uv light area you're probably like 300 meters away from where you were oh that's not bad actually i'm not like paul you just teleport you here wherever i like landed on a patch i was safe but i was stuck there so i think you can only really teleport when you're about to talk to someone i guess i could like theoretically fast travel if i'd unlock the fast travel surely they didn't make us go all the way back to bazaar just to come all the way back i think so i've never made it because this is going to take me forever if i go this way yeah there's uh no yellow stuff okay tell me the bit where it was like danger minefield yes okay i just went the wrong way damn discovered i can't get i don't think i can get there the way i'm going so because i went through the tunnel where you like first meet waltz i'm nearly there here we go i remember you from the bazaar you got the option yes there it is it's got a legendary newspaper next time a feeling we've crossed it's god given up no why are they after you probably the same reason as you to access the gre database what do you want from it aiden why are you risking so much [Music] i'm looking for my sister your sister was in the gre she no she was a prisoner i haven't seen her in 15 years a prisoner you mean a test subject i don't know what i'll find she's she's the only family i've got the only answer to what waltz has done to us waltz he held us there had a hobby of experimenting on kids did you know about that i was only a mid-level doctor aidan i'm sorry you should shark in the responsibility want to know anything else or can we go how are you planning to get us inside the observatory look there's a security tunnel into the complex it was locked up years ago give me the key aidan how scary is this game it's not very scary bgrt are you sure the key is functional well it has been maybe the problem is that the building is gonna have to be electricians there's any other way to get in there dying light bulb three to risk a lot if you ask me okay and come with me electric electric boogaloo dying light bulb 3 um stay sparky is the name of the game sorry i'm right next to you yeah where did she go oh well that's just what happens to the characters in this game they fast travel [Music] it's so weird when they just blink around like that yeah well i don't think it happens is weirdly in single player oh this is where we came before like we came in this area and you know we fell to the ground around us [Music] the weird balls the weird bulls in see those domes sure but the place is flooded with chemicals the gre had a solution for that when they created the thv gen mod they had to protect their employees from exposure with the thv what the chemicals they came up with blockers shots that would shield their workers for a few minutes from the fumes fortunately i still have two doses had a feeling they'd come in handy one day hmm those must be worth a pretty penny they are extremely rare for now we will need only one for you so let's do this when you get there first restore the power then i'll be able to join you hold out your arm remember stick it in me the shot shields you from the chemicals for a limited time only can't i take the other one too no not at the same time this stuff's too strong go as fast as you can to the smaller dome and from there to the higher one you should find a door leading inside there you'll be safe then head to the b block there you should find the building's main circuit breaker as soon as you turn on the electricity the security door will unlock and i can join you by going through the tunnel i showed you now go the blocker is working this does sound like quite a mission doesn't it many people will be kicked off roofs if possible or into chemicals so we can run through this now i have some of these like just like i don't know you can just take them at any point yeah well no there's like chemical boosters like this i mean the ones are for the night whereas these are for just chemicals it's like fire boosters and shock boosters well that was easy that was a very simple parkour course wasn't it this way i guess i made it through yeah it's great now just get to the second one find a door a hatch or oh god the rope that you've just swung on isn't there for me i've missed you get in [Music] force kill respawn god tom i don't i should put me next to you because we're animation miles away yeah i'm here again okay i made it okay i'll be there in a sec there's a crate as well that you can open oh you went on a rope you did a grapple veronica found the entrance so far what's the crate how do you know so well by the way i was here just once ago but i have a good memory that sounds useful well sometimes it's a curse careful tom [Applause] that's not a pipe i can swing on we're gonna have to go in that wars there yeah all players needed these are level five here though what level five zombies yeah just over three right i have a whole lot infected here [ __ ] i hoped it would be empty by now well it isn't i don't know if i can get through use the uv flashlight on your belt that should keep them at bay oh yes just don't stop aiden all right let me equip it yeah i need to look at mine as well where is it where is it again tom is it an accessory it's in it's an accessories yet i can't just do this though um let's go there's more rounds try and go over them if you can where do we have to go sit down the store around yeah we're done [Music] nice not again oh wait should we just try and run for that door go go a bunch of lockers here [Music] and a door here jack look oh we can't get through that it's not going to stop it's horrifying i hate it i'm doing it i can't do it somewhere this that was awesome he's been electrified this place was quite the hive plenty of infected but i was pain oh the shark has stopped now i jump too early we gotta keep going our way jack this way the electric stopped don't worry i'll fix it meet her near the door please don't leave me here don't you be afraid you just need a moment don't meet me don't leave me i'm just absolutely crapping herself is it down low we're going the wrong way jacks there's no zombies there yeah we're going the wrong way the objective marker doesn't want us wants us to be down here for some reason please let me out she said something about a fuse did it she did yeah she said something about a fuse maybe that's where you're trying to breathe yeah it was a lot better easy don't leave me she's not happy is she giving birth shouting won't do anything except attract infected she's just late calm down i won't leave you yeah hold up veronica i'm just trying to get some loot it's just loot here you get it check the door if it's available oh i'm gonna open this i'm going to attempt to open this one it is open yeah there's a wire here and i've just picked it up i'm an idiot release another crate here yeah she's having a panic attack isn't she there's a cable in the other room to the left and then you need to park or over maybe we'll run off the generator to the left this way i don't think i could make it yeah well how much slack have you got 28 meters okay yeah go one way then oh nice and there was a rage oh you can do that easy so drop down onto the generator yeah drop that no no drop down to the generator in the middle get a plan on the right and then warm off the top led on this wall yeah yeah awesome good job nice we're gaming now we can save veronica i'm playing at 4k autumn veronica the power's back you all right she should be here [Music] veronica i'll meet you by the elevators she's turned doesn't she no i don't think so i think she's just like claustrophobic having a panic attack or something unless maybe it's ready tom what's claustrophobic it just means you don't like tight small spaces [Music] are you all right see told you everything would work out just get in i'm pretty close to throwback really do you mind heights are you okay with lights i'm fine my heights yeah i do all sorts of crazy stuff on buildings yeah paraglide you've always been claustrophobic i did like a cave crawl thing through like the you ever seen them we're really tight yeah yeah so the wheels are really tight aidan for god's sake can we not talk about this right now how to crawl like 30 meters in a space where like it was my body only just about failed give me a moment yeah if you start panicking in that kind of situation that's pretty if you're better than this you can't turn around another six floors down that elevator is bigger than my flat this is a pretty high tech before the gre this complex was run by the military they used it we've come across a few bugs though and i think the writing's pretty bad but the gameplay you know that's quite the story they used to call places like the axes have done their best to history great dark again wait i'll try and figure something out more electricians tom i think the plot's good enough for a game like this you don't play it for the story you know it's just to keep you just to give you something to do whilst you're parkouring around leveling up electricity here we could use it to power up the whole floor hey john next to me we need to open these doors somehow maybe from the other side okay it's open somewhere i didn't see any other routes though there's there that's why you need to plug it in through there look let's go vent okay nice good find i've got the crawl animation i'm still out you run out slack or no i'm just oh yeah i did yeah you need to wait for me to do it then oh yeah you go open the door well like usually you do this yourself and come back but the fact that i'm here i can just drop down it's a tight fit in here i thought it was a longer cable than that so janky sometimes no i'll just plug this cable in it might work uh i hate this button for you yeah and then [Music] you're doing great just talk to me why are you really helping me i'm not gonna be able to get around there there's another door though frank told me it was important can you get to this door where i'm at that's it you probably don't know much about frank and the night runners we owe him well everything maybe you can drop in from the vents come back come back found a button here hang on oh my key won't go in where do i go i'm just thinking can you drop in that room from above through the vent uh that's blocked off what about the vent that we were in before there has to be something in here i mean surely as you have to do this i think there's something here so in the room that's next to me there's like a a place to put the grd key but i can't find i couldn't give me a prompt it's another container [Music] defense system scanning but i reckon it's in the events on i have to guess yeah i think there's like another route i could have gone let's go look there's a hard lock pick here no just ends there no there's nothing i've missed here what about grapple somewhere you grapple up there no i peeked at this door and i tried to open it nothing worked there's no way in that vent oh there's a there's a upstairs to this room here tom i think this might be it come to me oh i spotted and then there's a vent over there did you get the crate below you uh yeah i did oh no i didn't sorry yeah if you go through i'll get the cable all right hey good find this is it yeah am i above it now yeah more or less you need to come more to your left though i think if you go left and then left again that'll take you into the room okay there you go yeah the buttons this side there you go yeah the dream work good sounds i mean stuff like that really works for co-op just a shame that i can't touch the wire without getting stuck rerouting the circuit yeah saved my life a few times yeah i'm a qualified electrician at this point should we get going yes let's get this over with him i've tried the shotgun bassmaster i haven't got it upgraded so it didn't do much damage for me and she's gone i don't know the main computer is there are we following i finally know what happened to your sister she's all i have what about your parents i don't remember them just her we we were a good team without her it's like uh god i don't know you don't know what well i don't really know who i am we are all different people than we were troll's a great game we all got good she's gonna put the key i need you answer don't tell me there we go it's locked again what now the terminal is inactive the security system isolated this area guess i'm up i've got an idea try to find the officer's room there's a security desk we could try to operate the door locks from there you should be able to use your gre key on it you sure know a lot about this building please just insert the key and select emergency unlock on the screen i'll explain everything to you when we're done i think i found the way we need to get in accidentally okay about this way uh up there look i'm just gonna pick this lock first up down oh yeah [Music] oh the yellow things back here lady thank you i don't know the symbols back here some [Music] so don't think it's through the vents just need your hair and we can do this okay put it in i'm thinking it's just over complicated now because we're just like finding these routes to get to different areas it worked yeah but we may have another problem i'm stuck here i need to find a way out oh no probably gonna exit uh i don't think so just stay where you are look for vince can i see you do the gollum again it's me doing the golem whatever you want yeah up here it should not look like that should it i my friends are here our friends want to close our lots we're having a tea party i'm sure you'll enjoy it oh no it's a lot of zombies done stomp on him to make sure we stomp on him jack yeah [Applause] [Music] just ignore that pretend that's not what that looks like on my screen that was a mad cabinet here grab yourself a medkit come on you got this you do that all right i got this open says me unique joggers well that's dead end oh there's a thing here oh this is new there's a zombie stood in front of you that's fine and the grid didn't actually break out we have to break off the other side or smoke it oh doctor veronica ryan director field laboratories department oh level gre doctor my ass we've been hoodwinked tom seems to be veronica's office oh come on kid you weren't honest with me veronica it's not bobby as well who's that boy maybe a funny thing seems there was another veronica ryan director field labs department i was going to tell you why are you helping me are you working with walt waltz no never even back then i didn't waltz had his own research team but you knew about the experiments how they used kids me and my sister that's why i'm here aiden i i cannot forget what we did here that we let you down all those kids in pain and no cure to show for it sure we were five for [ __ ] sake small children showed natural immunity to the virus we saw a correlation between age brain development and infection severity that's why they were experimenting on you the gre the world needed you you seemed our only hope i'm sorry that's a completely different take wasn't it that i'm sorry those experiments no the tests on children were all performed at a laboratory here we were gathering data and compiling research i was here when it all happened team members began to turn and things quickly spiraled out of control oh no one by one we were locked inside hiding sneaking around through those dark corridors and ventilation shafts my son he was here with me paul he was five back then too paul of how's the streak let's go we've got things to do yeah got things to do let's see places to be zombies stomp drop kicks to kick where's she going mannequins to walk into and they completely disappear she just doesn't care so i mean she has got a strong cranium is it god are you god is it god god is a woman was ariana grande right are you god is that god god she just walks so slow someone made you walk behind someone in assassin's creed in a parkour game so i'm going in hope you find what you've been looking for this is the observatory then the gre's right am i right is this the observatory now what's up damn it i don't know try it again it's stuck [ __ ] it i'll go no i'm done waiting it's time for answers oh this is a boss fight room for everyone here we go why is the texture detail so low on those screws yeah i see that veronica what's going on talk to me veronica are you okay it looks like we tripped it along contamination procedure take contamination procedure that can't be good it's not chemical decontamination is deadly how do we stop it i don't know veronica veronica we're going to get deep contamination i can't stop it would it help us since we're partially on the phone think faster blockers i still have one you have to find one for yourself any idea where to look the control room maybe they kept them there go find the controller this is picking up interesting control room control room to the right what's that we have a minute no buttons here up here up here control room upstairs can't grab it it's one of these oh it's the one you're out yeah yeah oh okay yeah we messed that up didn't we it's fine i feel like everyone would have had that issue i think swing off this oh you have to time it and grab something jack that's spinning around i mean maybe i'll figure out the question i'll figure out the way no [ __ ] no there yeah yellow ones [Music] you have to wait this whole way oh you do you just have to like you know wait in the different doorways can you not go left i think so it's the 10. now we messed up we have to do that so quick what ah i nearly got it you don't have to wait to go around something you can just go the opposite direction okay we'll fail at this time what we're doing now [Music] what if we oh we can still do it it's just no could we use the grapple grapple damn it yeah we could have that's i was thinking but when they put you under pressure like that you're just like oh 10 seconds ptsd to the windmill i mean it was horrible find a way up hurry control room upstairs [Music] i see you staffed away though so the yellow screens are all together yeah i know i [ __ ] know i think if you go now maybe yeah no just outreach gonna be fast could be first gonna be first did you get it oh what the why didn't it latch on [Music] i think i'm gonna have to come though the fun part [Music] oh yeah [Music] we can still do it dad wake up and we're just surrounded by dead zombies again i'll just kill them all i'm on a roof how did this happen i've just got black screen i think we could have just swung though with the grapple i did oh you did yeah the moment of truth damn it's broken oh no you [ __ ] me yeah i am it's just an old system wait give me the key oh jack there was a key right there was a hole right there the whole time oh my god there is a list of patients in person mind blown crazy who do you want to check first yeah oh you gotta choose search for mia is that your sister yes nothing impossible she was there with me i'm searching sorry records show no patience named mia god it's impossible i will check my name aidan hey he's gonna be there as well uh there's one record among the youngest children well look at her eyes what the hell 20 20. is that your surname well it's just the color what does it say she got like one of those overlappings oh yeah kinda only one note warning patience shows an above average tolerance to the substance most tests performed exemplary results that explains it oh flashback [Music] that's like the 15th pfizer booster we've had aidan you all right yes i think so is there anything else madonna pfizer johnson johnson no that's all waltz checking astrazeneca one record clinical studies there's a song for you yeah what is it study abandonment all patients discharged yes damn it no inform where they ended up or about their substance uh 1354 or something i'm sorry aidan i don't think mia was imaginary adriana although that's an interesting theory i think that she was real the substance was also tested on some infected at gre facilities across the city to no avail the project was run and supervised from x-13 it was eventually shut down as was x13 itself is there anything more about this x13 in here i doubt it but i heard about it x13 was a hub of gre operations and the substance you know what it is max 13 wolverine's daughter studies aiden let me search this yeah we said this yesterday anyway it was x23 something something's wrong what do you mean it says the procedure's been initiated another procedure i'm looking lots of data started then paused 11 years ago resumed a few days ago x10 there's also a map several locations are marked including the observatory what the hell does it all mean i have no idea but intruder alert intruder waltz infected yeah they must be here they must have followed us there's no time hurry take the key hide yourself somewhere and lock yourself in i'll deal with them aiden we don't know how many there are i'll handle it i'll drop kick him what the hell does this need to be a cutscene well it's so seamless in single player jack like you don't fade to black but it's it does weird stuff in co-op okay i think we gotta try and stealth this then yeah yeah because they've lined it up like this i've got the stab one so i'm just gonna fly through it i don't know if i can kill this guy [Music] hang on i'll get behind him just staying covered for now damn it he's running [Music] there you go it's easier now if you don't stop oh yeah oh do you think it was over i thought it was overhead just running around with a spear these locations on the gre system they appear to be targets targets for missile strikes missile strikes what are you talking about the soul strikes the failsafe protocol we don't have much time listen this marks river end and garrison that's in the central loop people live there you have to warn frank okay okay i will hey frank frank your neighborhood is marked on some tactical map you have to tell people to evacuate come on no time to explain just clear everyone out of there frank [ __ ] okay the whole observatory is going to explode i mean this hasn't been a playable area before so it could just get blown up i think they're nuking stuff from the observatory right because we're not in the observatory at the moment can i this is weird i guess we gotta run waiting to get in we just gotta defend it what this door isn't open for you no they're trying to open it this door is fully open for me and i can see them we've got to go up here tom and then drop down into the room and kill them i think yeah okay there we go yeah that door was open for me jack they were just holding a crowbar to it and not doing anything unusual i'm a fan you heard about all your friends getting dropped off you want to get drop kicked off no don't jump down that was the perfect drop kick opportunity yeah that was my job there's a guy up top as well look can you go then i'll i'll get the on top oh he's jumped down already i'm out of stamina i really don't like this hold on let's be the big guy oh jesus that called me he's dead the guy's dead i've been killed by another one i've actually downed it's a guy with a bow on the rocks to you right [Music] yes so oh wait i just teleported to you i'm good i look so weird from third person all right back in this just nope i'm in jack you can walk through that i can't i think it's safe now but we have to get going wait have you glitched it veronica like it's just the door isn't all right all right i can go through this one shut it um we've got to go up again oh do we you're fine i've got the wrong thing or no yeah we could have just literally done that when the time the whole time oh my god veronica you there to be fair i don't know if we oh no we were supposed to get the grapple when we did all right an area cuties five cents yeah there's a door here she went through this door didn't she let's get in there we're on a car talk to me i'm sorry she got out by calling the tightest event ever unless you see your way that way oh this door no kill chill parkour i love it see you to drop veronica talk to me veronica mars where are you i'm coming please wait please please wait please wait please wait please wait please wait open open open it's a run sequence definitely if it faces is away from the thing you run from it if you see an agent you run exactly i'd like to fight him though yeah we will he's going to catch us he's going to hop out of the vent somewhere [Music] veronica i love you veronica i should have passed through it veronica get away [ __ ] so dark tom give it to me yeah they've never turned the flashlights on for these kind of scenes oh there we go [Music] yeah he's part of zombo isn't he i'll stop him yeah there we go [ __ ] what have you done with mia little boy boy boy boy boy oh he doesn't just go down give me the [ __ ] stuff [Music] you know what the boss fights remind me of this in this game skyrim yes we're going to go second mode again perhaps or he's going to be some exposition perhaps why does he look like a vampire hacker he just does man it's the cloak isn't it with a red trim years ago how many broken bones would that be a lot aiden that'd be ash on the floor he'll be okay just hold on [Music] no don't kill her imagine she's just like you just heat surround yourself snaps like loki oh no oh my god that's even worse than i imagined is this because of my previous choices or does this just always happen no this is definitely like how it goes why is there no music there is my god he's got the key okay we ripped her leg off mate underarm what what have you done to me i showed you the truth it's too late [Music] you weren't wrong about the nukes jack [Laughter] ripped her apart aidan stay with me let's cut the kilo on [ __ ] ayden you're heavy is it being hot isn't it why did we like only activate hold on in that moment hold on i don't know he's doing it yeah we've been we've been passing out like that throughout the game so that's the first time we've seen it it just hasn't been on zombies it's been on an ally okay i'm just waking up on the roof again i'm back thank god you really gotta stop doing that you had me worried and i don't get worried keep away from me luanne wow i mean it's not like i expected flowers but for digging you out from under the rubble and carrying you here on my back a small thank you would be nice you don't understand the wine i you what i am oh what does his name kill veronica what i killed her just ripped her legs off and choked him and not only that killed is an understatement correct i'm turning i saw veronica's body it was torn as if by a volatile you couldn't it was me odds told me that mia's dead i have to get away from here i'm a threat if i stayed not to everyone what if he lied to you and mia's alive and even if not you didn't kill veronica aiden that wasn't you yes it was it was i repeat that was not you as it was if this transformation is because of waltz your face looks awfully tasty right now got your nose waltz created the inhibitors he must know how to counter their effects come on what's the name probably another building collapse [Music] or if this affects the main world like well it changes it yeah oh my god i'm surprised the butcher he's finishing what he started 11 years ago it's walter he used the key that's when this all started what are you talking about dylan didn't want waltz getting the gre key he knew the whole city would be at risk wallace took the key from veronica and escaped apparently he needs it for something else do you see now you have to stop him him and williams no matter what one i can't control when i turn any moment now i can when you feel something happening just get to a uv light i can't stop them alone aiden okay okay let's get him let's get him now he wants to meet with the butcher what i had the same reaction but he says that after the bombing williams contacted him and that he wants to talk frank lost your mind mine that's why i'm going to cover their idiotic asses you go to the fisheye maybe you can still talk frank out of this stupid idea if that doesn't work i won't be far aiden nobody can know about veronica remember aidan drop kicker but jack the peacekeepers they won't they give a [ __ ] they can't stop us they won't dropkick see the volumetric fog and the lighting in this game is so nice but a lot of these cutscenes are really flat there's no like surrounding spotlights combat points with the bow that's it baby precise aiming piercing and bonus damage hello oh my god frank frank i really need to sort my inventory do you copy i'm flying jack bye bye have a look they might have been looting oh yeah i can't i can't see a thing in here but a massive cloud of fog and smoke there's ash everywhere but yeah like there are broken buildings and stuff it's cool let's change the map oh god that didn't work what'd spooky it is very ominous inhibit detected huh inhibitor detected we've got three more cones to drop what's up what's up there i guess what's up uh a bloater thing just blew up on me dad ruined i'm fine yeah my gamers just stopped playing music for some reason yeah that's weird i have it turned on that mine's been doing it there's a propeller here around this area again really bad luck stoddard that's weird isn't it yeah it's just the the hubs like the central hub where the people are he teleports to me the vendors and stuff yeah if you start talking to her you made out like a bandit amigo i guess is uh whatever the objective is best prices in town sweetie the best prices in town what is that that's horrible i'm literally like 20 i fps why it does that you know yeah but it's like it's just a trailer any time no there's an objective get to the campaign sorry my bad my bad oh god all right i'll make it jack power through power through the 5 fps you can teleport if you want if i try it it like puts me in slow-mo countdown i think i'll get there faster if i um my head i've got so much gear that i just wasn't wearing that's just really good uh i'm i will make it i'm turning just fairy tales if you ask me open door yeah there's no way store could have played like this for the whole session that memory leak it's hard [Music] all right if you upgraded all your gear and stuff like what you're wearing we have medicine contact us by radio i haven't got like any new outfit stuff i've upgraded my night run paraglider to the max weapons you're in one piece frank if you're going to the stronghold i'm going with you kid stop sit down i'm walking towards this man in slow motion which means you're probably what do you mean look i'll tell you but this has got to stay between us got it got it just tell me there will be more missile attacks william says most of the central loop will be destroyed you understand waiting for other players as you stutter through the cutscene uh jared do you get the grapple through a mission yeah you do it's quite late in the game though what's up emerson are you still on the cutscenes on [Music] tom how many lines of dialogue do you think from him hello hello can you hear me can you hear me yeah i can hear you okay how many lines of dialogue from him why because in like 5 fps like i could just drop out and you can invite me again if you want um it just says waiting for players before proceeding okay okay well i'm gonna have to sit through this for a sec does he talk for long he wasn't talking that long okay it must be a bug with cop yeah this is this area these problems yesterday none of them so you get to a certain point in the game and then cops just ruined yeah like literally it's locked at like five six fps until we get out of the hub so weird what's up kai how you doing hey jarrod there's sticks yeah i'll upgrade the glider in the grapple is he still talking on your game yeah there we go there we go i don't know frank i want to go

jar the one with the green herbs inside do you smell it same smell the renegades use churrari it is odorless no it's totally just smelling like this one so tell me five pieces are needed to counteract the poison they grow beneath the waters nearby mix them with this before administering it can you skip the cutscenes tom you can buy spam in space oh wait hang on i've got i've got frames back out of nowhere boom hello this decides the entire end of the game and the twist will piss you off okay you skip cut scenes for me all right this is playing smooth now i'm waiting for you i presume you're still watching it yeah i can't skip let's catch up it's quite janky isn't it mm-hmm yeah it was it was so smooth for us but yeah certain point in the game i think you're right they just haven't got far enough to test it on all platform well seems like a pc issue game is a console port and finish she's giving me sacred violet finish five pieces are needed to counter out the poison they grow beneath the waters nearby makes them with the this before it makes a little i'm out i'm out of the house and closing the door and fps is back it's such a weird bug man and we're fine where are we going the rope there over here so not the way i'm swinging i think we've got to die from find out oh no that's back towards the hub jack was he shot near the hub yeah he was at the hub oh god so it just works five herbs i've got one you take them i'll let you take them just in case it bugs i'll try and find them there can you scan for him with you yeah [Music] i found one quite easily there [Music] another one here could be in like what do they look like is it like a plan they're just like highlighted red yeah [Music] can you go over here no i don't see them when i scan this one's in a little crevasse or something oh my god don't get me stuck game please just drown it's so weird without the music there we go that's all five it's simple thump symbols you want money you want money no no fbs stay with me i have the antidote on my way you get out there hanson i'm not gonna make it jack i'm gonna like this is fine like really good fps then i try and get anywhere near that renegades think they're tough you can just go anywhere near that homily just ruined you again it's just not possible yeah what if you're really really bad hold on engine playing a window or something trying if the game lets me gonna wait for you [Music] we try [Music] you in a window now i'm here but it's still an issue always eager to punish yeah this is a weird one you you have a promise to keep remember

you're back frank it's all right breathe okay oh he's alive is he yep he's fine i'll chop off william's [ __ ] and jam it down his throat wow i said that they don't use the poison according to said something okay what she said the renegades don't use this kind of poison they do now yeah but why would they try to kill frank if williams wanted to talk because it was a lie i'm going to the stronghold and not with that wound of yours someone should stay with him luanne fine ask jack for help he knows a way into the stronghold aiden don't [ __ ] this up yes man that's a promise i presume this will be the last time we're in this area tom i hope so i've just got some frames so can we step outside though it seems like you get your frames back when i'm waiting for you yeah it's a very

i've got mommy here where looking at the floor oh no i've been put with the zombies thumb oh god oh yeah i see that's a nice picture wait for other players before proceeding frames are back frames back wait as soon as i get to the end of the cutscene it allows you to yeah run [Music] this is so weird [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm literally watching the slideshow of the game oh run for your life i suppose you stuck down there with a load of friends uh make the most of the frames make the most of the frames make the most of the frames back give me like two of your friends i don't know what's going on with you again i've jumped ready to do the jump ascended i've landed frames about frames back parkour not that way you're about to die [Music] okay this is fine it's fine here we go here we go all right can you come to me now i'm on the floor you're dying i don't know i'm i'm waiting for a remember volatile there yeah yeah yeah you left a volatile mind for me i didn't even see that tom i have to be honest with you what do i do here can you start some sort of cut scene audio weapons i'm just not using are you waiting for me no no what's that although i'm just going to modify this put the flames on it put the reinforcement on it there it is why do you not die tom because i can't it's in that like because i guess we're in the end game now this is like you know games don't watch anime not really harold i used to when i was younger i mean shall i drop out and you invite me like you're not gonna come and revive me are you oh i've teleported to you there you go and you're revived and i've got two fps are you up or down you gotta come down there we go oh frames oh yeah look at the slide oh yeah [Music] waiting for the players you should get your friends back now yep frames are back frames are indeed back full frames let's go there's a man with a golden mask stood right in front of me yeah i see that he seems quite dangerous oh wow i think we should drop kicking tom yeah i mean there's some spikes behind him they're looking quite tasty well i've got one frame now so why it's absolutely choked for you i don't understand your picture i'll see a picture of him in the spikes in a second this is great it's a great experience we've added like an extra hour and a half to our walkthrough oh absolutely there we go okay fed in the back frames are back here we go here we go good kick good kiss kick you into the front these are frames into the spikes i'm stuck kicking on you're slowing just jumping on it is back okay looks dangerous sir he's drinking it what zapped him right in the face you see that's that picture was sick new screenshot thumbnail for the next video tom the weirdest thing just happened man oh jack i i know what it looks like so don't even come out let's the weirdest thing happened tonight okay right there was a man in the corner upstairs he threw a molotov at me as he was throwing it yeah i hit him and then and he stood in the corner and as i was beating him into a pulp he took a drink from the mother this is tongue stupid man what the hell man i gotta see that i've got this medkit yeah any second i'll grab that make it i think we've got to go in the van with this land got it turning around hyper speed intense music no music tom that was very intense for me jack so i've got all the music and you've got all the frames get away from me get out of here i think it's a good trade stronghold you are you crazy no idea [Music] doesn't kill me that will i'm so [ __ ] man i'm betraying the [ __ ] predicates man am i high just get me in and you'll be fine the butcher's got me by one bowl and matt got the other god separated the balls tom [Music] oh no frames oh my god wait it can consistently crash here i've got a black screen tom what are you doing i've got a top-down view of a vehicle uh driving out of a garage at one frame per second about to run over some zombies oh he's about to get run over back screen bam get okay you just drove right through them like frames ah no frames on black screen right so we got this issue again are we restart the game yeah i think it's good idea okay i'm going to restart guys how deep is the stream while we know jack we are now four hours and six minutes in okay not the seven that it feels then yeah i have to all that for this don't i yeah game master has quit so they call me the game master i call you the game master i call you the game master as well oh my god frames oh let me just run around for a bit oh yeah it feels good it's it's a bug uh gingerbed maybe i'll get mused about now as well 50 50 if it loads or crashes in this part okay so multiple people have just said in my stream that this part is 50 50 if it crashes i think we're just so much further ahead than the general population like they're probably fixing the early bugs and then getting to the later ones true mate true my music's back yes that's good you know you can hear the intense music i was hearing [Music] it's all good fun guys it's all good fun bam we're gonna drop a code in the chat right now yoink don't take it thomas thank you to the epic game store for sponsoring and give me these codes [Music] uh oh why have i got to do this again didn't save the whole wow oh he drinks it spits out with a lighter doesn't he okay that kind of makes teleported through the floor as well oh sorry that was a friendly um [Music] you really lose stamina with this how do you say one of those inhalers that gives you stamina [Music] [Music] [Music] there we go right i'm gonna do the cutscene and

district the butcher took them in and fled towards that hill i sent my men after him but i might not be able to manage on their own i'll send you their coordinates i'll find him only he can lead you to waltz there might be new zombie types i forgot my button this totally isn't dlc guys whoever was saying that what the what that was the bomber guy no yeah he blew up next to you they don't look like bomber guys tom blow to dude that just explodes because he's like awake they're not tom what you're right oh my god actual suiciders i think these are in the first game well you died to one yeah

collapsing around us thomas you're tearing me apart lisa i didn't want oh god i don't want to use this don't worry about it i went to press f to do the take down and grabbed the turret behind him and then shot him right oh my god i don't want to remember the game this way well you will now oh no yeah i one day i agreed to play it in court with jack and then after that it all went downhill so i guess we'll look forward to dying like three you're not alive you're not alive i refuse to believe it captain prices on your ass oh it's a big lad that didn't work these guys are uh pretty hard jack you gotta dodge [Music] yes okay i think we need to use the bows against those ones my chat are saying they're called drowners or something were they in the first game i don't remember they look like all the other big guys i suppose you could just one hit them i can't heal there's a container here though you okay and i'm also just kicking randomly when i heal it's fine it's now on eberton look at the mission names now or never time is up the herbal essences all right who's fiddling with this button that does nothing this panel does nothing these doors do nothing this way though it's all over williams that's man took over the stronghold come inside sauce it's over aidan you see ever since this city ran out of ammo i was keeping some for a special occasion this bullet was really meant for waltz should we work together um i think he's gonna shoot either way we can still work together williams work together why would i do that well if you really want to stop waltz that's a big reason he's against waltz we are as well right so maybe maybe that's the right call but there is one problem you just killed my people the last who were loyal to me i don't trust you it's over aidan this city is doomed just tell me where walt's is williams tell me how to find him and i'll leave you alone stupid kid you really think you're gonna stop him i was trying but he tricked me and you you will manage to deal with him say your prayers no guess we're going to fight him you're too weak for that yeah if you wanted to you would have killed me at the door now you're too weak for that you know jack [ __ ] about me pilgrim but there is one thing we have in common we don't destroyed if you want to stop waltz you have to get to x-13 waltz is on his way there going through the tunnels from garrison in the central loop right speed runtime i see it in your eyes son he experimented on you maybe he's not about that go to x13 i hope you make it before you turn pilgrim all oh my god why'd you do that that just seemed so random and out of character it was it didn't what it didn't seem earned i mean we killed all his men he's got no friends left he doesn't want to live alone and he's got no love life he's in an abandoned city with zombies uh most people would have done it uh let's just keep moving and pretend it's just fine okay he's not the first it won't be the last welcome the dying light too tutorial complete [Applause] yes he took williams men and went to the city center to x-13 williams mentioned tunnels in the center district in the central loop times [Music] health or stamina more health wait i'm doing health yeah more health is there drivable vehicles in this game oscar apparently there's an easter egg where you can get a pedal bike that's lovely i've seen a video of it on pc gamer what platform does he play on uh pc i think because he's a pc gamer you see that would make sense i kind of feel sad that we've just like stopped using the grapple hook as well like that i've been using it a bunch around here it's great i feel like spider-man swinging through the sea downtown new york because it like saves you for full damage yeah i suppose it's just i don't i feel like oh you bastard as soon as i say that you blow up and shove me off a roof who did i almost die one of the exploders i blew up and i just went flying off a roof go up left go left i can just hear things horrible things behind me tom oh god they're all chasing me it's fine it's fine oh why why are you the way you are oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god what did i do to deserve this don't

this tom i think they know do you think they know i think they know okay i think there's no way they don't [Music] i mean i'd love to see on the um i heard of some of these issues had none of them i checked the steam reviews earlier because i was like why so many people like talking about this stuff and it's it's the steam reviews are all extremely positive like there's not there are negative reviews but it it's like you know when you click steam it's like yeah they're very positive but i don't think most people have got to this point in the game so they're not running the first time and a lot of people play solo but yeah this memory lake is now affecting everything it's all just pain [Music] i guess i have to speak to them [Music] let me restart my game again just to reset the memory leak there's no objective for me tommy's poked oh yeah i quit the game and crashed in the process tom i pressed quit in the game crashed tom i can't continue without me well there's no objective does it defeat the renegades there's no more renegades tom there's gotta be more you just scan about nope there's no more thumb all i know is pain yeah the enemies inside the walls again take me to the renegades do you know where the renegades are guys do you count maybe this guy counts yes he counted okay he just spawned out nowhere [Music] another attack williams was right i need to get the key from walt disney's entire city and we need to check out wounded that missile hit old villador a lot of people live there be careful that cloud is basically a wall of deadly chemicals it'll kill you or turn you into a monster it's too late to worry about that killian yeah he threw the molotov at me but he didn't spawn for ages like he should have been in this area and he was like over there somewhere like 500 meters away it's all pain you're leaving the missionary i'm not okay i'm going away from that area thomas would you like an invite yeah sure i'll give it go online menu friends tomographic send in my name there we go not brilliant let me just press play game find the tunnel entrance and i have lord is back and we okay to find the entrance [Music] i don't yeah he's a man yeah they were turning i guess [Applause] it's tina turner [Applause] you couldn't open it might be one that you have to come back at night right right here it's simple oh perfect lovely long picture behind us needed do you have anything no i don't know i'll do them all then shall i make some out of scraps i'm turning why i don't know i open them i opened the container and started turning for some reason they call me tina turn it damn there's nothing here check the shelves i'm turning again it's fine i'm just trying to open this just trying to open this container and it's faded black and i'm not going to get that loo ever again i'm outside now it's not like i wanted that loot anyway what just happened it makes sense it makes perfect sense we were turning and now we're zombies that's so strange we're returning and now we're on come on i have to open like a normal person [Music] but jackie makes so much more sense in single players [Music] yeah i think i was experiencing the cuts like the animations and stuff that you should have been experiencing like you're the host why am i the one seeing all the stuff what were you seeing like i was turning and my eyes went blue and it'll be all right fell to the ground a few times will you cure her i'm doing what i can but she's weak much weaker than the other children but you can save her aiden hey before he was zombified he's like a weird acid trip so yeah that's a good way of putting it yeah i mean at this stage we've uh we've seen some stuff i'm just waking up on the rooftop of my mind yep what was that i haven't experienced that before wait this is the roof out this is the bridge outside of the city it's a completely different place i saw walt sloane i almost got i think it's supposed to be like he you know he goes unconscious and he loses control yeah he's like he's been on a rampage as a zombie aiden i don't like that i'll be okay i picked up his trail i'm going after him aiden stop tell me [Music] okay elon musk we'll get through jack grapple all right so that's where you're headed okay we're nearly there we're almost done we're only an hour away no we've been saying we're almost there for the last three hours jack yeah but it would have gone a lot quicker if it wasn't for all the bugs and stupid stuff if we've known this was gonna be a problem after our tomorrow's experience we got off yesterday just jumping on heads smashing people out of the way time to go to work this is fun i need to let my rage out on some random zombies i don't think this does anything for your stats though it's nice to have fps as well and have actual in-game working slo-mo not three fps oh you're turning on your jack so am i come on no we can push you you can do it come on you're never going to watch this play play this game ever again are you sorry i will because i enjoy the gameplay i just don't know what's happened with the memory leaks like just don't understand experience because you're a host have i had a flawless experience there's been a lot of bugs for me so i'm let me tell you i just mean with memory leaks all right my frames per second has been great it's 60 constant bugs wise no well mine is when we're here this is absolutely fine i found him in open places like this but certain areas like i don't know what happens well take a look at what happened seriously just out of [ __ ] sometimes no sounds and sounds even know where you're going i've got no idea i can't grapple that [Music] [Music] still getting yourself into trouble i see you know it so guys if you made it this far into the playthrough well done you deserve a freaking award man frank almost died listen my viewers are here for the ride man i appreciate all of you guys from a potato everyone does that from sylvester stallone look at little one hey look me in the eye look at me luanne i will make it back that was the same voice line twice did you notice yeah you will look at me look at me one day let's see if he's right ladies did we get the crossbar yeah i want the autobot you get it from uh upgrading the peacekeepers most people wouldn't rush through the campaign the same way we have been it's getting worse isn't it you're pale i'll be all right we'll find it before it progresses any further you're pale it's me we will do this understood yeah yeah let's finish this okay here we go here we go here we did that go work for you tom yeah clean flawless mr toad's wild ride and i'm buckled up for their journey oh my god let me guess [Music] thomas was stuck one there the one which we call modifier aiden i took care of the barn but i have no idea how to open the door you don't have any arrows to use though there are plenty could you drop me something oh thank you love you um [Music] damage 25 missed wait for one i really don't know how to open it try to find another way inside oh there's all sorts of uh stuff here though i'm not picking this lock pick here as well afterwards you cannot craft anything i was screaming i'm useless tom i guess well that's why i'm useless tom i'll smoke the people usually have down time between all these missions because you can't you can't lose nothing left to me anymore tom your experience has been um flawless time ah there we go i've picked it there's stupid stuff in the back of the truck behind me what did you find big old axe oh look thinking purple i gotta wait wait for one so i guess they want us to loot this stuff just join the one for me oh is that it there's another one that's it i think couple of landmines there take that dla grenade sure assume she's in here i don't know is that the wrong way it's got me down here [Music] oh my god oh my god that was nice yeah and then the game played just cool stuff like that and then you're like okay so it's fun oh black screen so i hit it after open the door hey that's what i'm saying gameplay 9.5 yeah are you all right sure them not so much you shouldn't be bleeding leave it we've got bigger problems look is the boss fight in it this is waltz oh yeah oh my god what is that what is this oh my god what is this yeah that's weird water look at this it's food supplies no oh my god wow what is this my god it's a honeypot gre built this place for some people to survive the plague unlike the ark [Music] arch noah's ark from the bible there we go only there the goal was to save pairs of animals and here probably just goat [ __ ] from the gre that doesn't look like it's for regular people nope selfish assassins do you think she felt saying that it doesn't look like anyone made it here oh this script sounds really gritty i mean her scripts have been great compared to everyone else waltz was headed this way for sure he knew it contained everything he needed for survival she probably gave him different takes too you see like improvised improvised debates make him sound more natural for her some of the other characters are just reading off the paper and they're saying in english but it's been written by someone who's not english speaking watch out for the zombie i'll go first [Music] okay [Music] she doesn't have plot armor she's got to film the bloody mandalorian season 3. let me get this man down i did the same thing [Music] [Applause] for a second zombies sorry this way ross this has to be the ending this has to be the end i thought i feel like we've the control room is that way yeah waltz must be looking for something in there i mean full walls yet jack go after him eat it i'll try to find some bandages i won't leave you i'll quit it with the mother hen routine and get going find waltz and take that damn key from him aiden or we all die i'll come back for you i promise i promise i know that save villadore the rest can wait oh here we go tom oh it's just what you asked for now is the real fight [Music] you want to stealth it [Music] blast it off there's a thing in here though oh yes lockpick needed i shall do it first try you got 10 seconds done did it in two do you want to try and fight one or you know do you want to start oh they've moved on anyway what where'd they go tom the game just set up a fight or a stealth section and then i removed it and then just got rid of them i don't i don't understand i've gone down this am i going down there though is it just saying there's two in here gotta find waltz no plans required sorry i'm just snuffling some materials open says me [Applause] looking at the ceiling for no reason [Music] we need supplies everything's ready here's our beds why can't i remember taking this photograph look at this photograph [Laughter] i'm looking for like scraps and stuff that you can oh you go yeah check the trash and stuff i think you get scraps from there you check this the trash yeah there is scraps in the trash you you you oh wait i found you in the trash oh ladies and gentlemen we got him tomographic and jack frags fall out over trash joke that went too far where are you i don't know i'm just searching for trash cans because you said so it's a trash can this time i do exactly what you're telling me this is locked so that means nothing plays required found it get over here get over here christopher waltz great actor got nothing on this guy though you never leave me alone here never i won't leave you i swear i don't have to nothing could ever tear us apart anyway nothing aidan come on it's time you're never going to see your sister again oh damn i mean there's going to there's going to be a twist isn't there tom sorry it's got to keep following oh yeah definitely some kind of yeah he's our father they're like aidan's not real or me is not real or you're mia or monster he's our father just like in star wars i mean what's that star wars never heard of it it's a documentary there's no real ones there's a famous time traveler from the 1500s teleported to a galaxy far far away a long time ago and just documented everything that was happening i know boy i'm right here with you aiden aiden's loki that's the question we never had a sister think about this you ever thought about this there is aidan and aiden is mayor but walt is mere whilst aiden's mirror but where's mia i'll find her i promise who's mia run that actually hurts my eyes in real life huh the white screen what is happening oh yeah you're in a dark room um it's quite dark yeah i can't like any direct sunlight and i'm you know sounds like missiles or vampires i can't i'm building bursts i can't find any bandages screw that luan look for an exit and get the hell out of here aidan if the missiles are launching from here we need to find them oh she's going to blow it with a missile right after i find waltz through the door to the left supplies here jack there's a couple of items here legendary ones here on the table some trash here to search straight wait we've been through here find waltz he went through the other door no did you test the door this place is a nightmare tommy yeah here here this way and come come this way mind you behind you he's one because he went through this door didn't he yeah he's one of them he's sticking that as well he's got a kit i got a face she's dead i love those sound effects get away from here waltz where are you where are you you will get away this time that's one thing that i loved about uh batman vs superman like that like afflicts batman that's great he just didn't care anymore it's just like i don't care i'll kill you whatever it was good she didn't get enough screen time i didn't get a solo movie oh he's gonna be in the flash movie yeah yeah it's not gonna be you know i would have liked to see a solo before this superman i think you won't stop at this 12 three four or did we wait which way these steps going yeah this way you can see steps yeah press q yeah it wasn't working okay that's not did we come through this door no this is the railway right what i know he's got me look oh my god mia stop stop him ready three yep two one go you kick the you kick the wrong one but it's fine well you know it's usually like you get one on the left i'll get them on the right we see you i thought i was on the left stop to disrespect look when he stands around bloody dock there you go there you go this guy's an absolute united never seen it before yeah that's weird we we truth i do sometimes just loot in the middle of fights i'm sorry i don't know what to tell you like it's just how my brain is yeah it saves your time i mean she looks very frail yeah she does she's been through it man it feels bad down by the staircase to your left like a normal person looking for a body mattress to dive on t what [Music] what are you doing huh i have to get down there what what what are you doing what i was giving the copium fine i'll do it myself i could do this all day that'll be us in five minutes in five hours when we're 95 for the game aiden i found the hangar with the missile launchers on the lower level under the g block there are a lot of them the city won't survive kick the door open what you were supposed to get out of here i was there away from here now do you hear me i'm still here in the okay the one [ __ ] not now time not fps now no no no i'm just hearing like the comms he's talking to the one while he's talking drop kick that's perfect opportunity i don't know again it's gameplay that's my last warning years ago before my work was destroyed many have died but more will be saved what what the hell are you talking about why are you chasing me aiden what do you want i promise mia promise what why do you keep pretending you don't know the truth focus aiden try to remember just tell you could just tell me will you cure her i'm doing what i can but she's weak much weaker than the other children that's why she caught the virus i was going to say your kids got infected unless you see people want to stop my research they can't see how close we are to finding a cure whatever happens we must have together we must stick together no you didn't promise her you promised me no no no no you tortured us you were hurting me and mia no hayden i would never hurt my own child mia is my daughter no and you know that that is daddy then i can't believe i was right is he gonna cut his arm and say he's our father who won't hide i was looking for a cure for transplant for everyone with your help yes now leave while you still can that's why i need this key to say yeah give me the key i can't mia needs it aiden if you take it she'll die the missiles will level the city this is a choice the process must follow through to its end i can't let that happen then you have to die it was me and not our sister like i don't get it you see our dad he said mia is my daughter i don't know something i'm not that he's our father oh one spent skill points give me a second okay cool i'll say i'm on fire zombies a few knives in his face yeah i know i know oh they're fast yeah these are the these are the hard hair ones these ones actually do spit damage and take a lot of damage that one's floating it's fine it really just tanks those drop kicks oh they're jumping it's horrible nated you very good let me swing off that another nade's down i'm very sorry yeah i've got mine stomped but put mine's down yes mines will be good how about that nice zombies i suppose we can jump down as well right yeah we've been playing this whole area but just a bit more i mean it's such a weird boss fight tom isn't it like it is i think it's because we're so powerful now like yeah i've got no music either like it's just bugged out again i mean strange i mean you didn't have to stand far away and just throw knives in his face jackie could have really you know spice it up however you wanted the knives we're doing no damage he didn't do any special attacks or he didn't like he literally just walked slowly towards us it's over you know he's built different he's probably gonna turn into a zombie man now and we'll see him for the first time phase two it's never over with this guy is there so [Music] he hasn't reached his point there you go we're running out of time because it was harder early when we were fighting with the magic spells or whatever just immediately throw knives on it oh wow wow okay now jack is it yes i'm dead oh no tom i know i cannot i have to be revived throw her throw up on me yep [Music] wait are we fighting him in his final form now [Music] oh there he is what the hell yeah he's actually doing special attacks now as well switching weapons and doing everything else once does he go you asked for this [ __ ] everything from me oh oh my god he's down me i think we need uv tom to be honest because that's what like there we go look at that hey anything for him get away i hate that tom you could use parkour vote from above if you can let us park all this he's got throwing bloody rocks at us now what he's pulling up like pieces of the okay how do i there we go we use torch on him oh he's throwing rocks i'm that's suspended in their flights it's fine the rocks are like glitching in there i can't see him i'm katniss everdeen scan he doesn't highlight but you see an outline of him jesus it's not easy though he's just dodging those shots like it's nothing yeah he does oh my god i'm about to die about today i'm about to die oh i'm running through the chemicals can you craft anything breathe in in the chemicals um probably make some more maze or something yeah let me see if i can craft anything you think about our like uh immunity as well oh god i'm about to die from i mean have you got on the middle get in the middle i'm good dude i've got inhalers why did my critical my immunity doesn't nothing that him i really don't know i'm trying to attack him up close oh he's in the chemical you can't do anything when he's over there trying to use a environmental advantage i hit him again i had a takedown thing man when i was above him really yeah yeah trying to get above hey just like i'm hitting a bunch village [Music] if he's running you can get him easy this is so weird is it weird i mean if it was just you like maybe it wouldn't be so junk a lot of that again what the flowing rocks yeah i see that i see that it's fine you know as loud as about the place i'm grown stronger thinking you still can't beat me my vowel is now whoever wants to survive only thinks about himself it's whacking tom [Music] come on this way this way [Music] yeah it's in the middle i did big damage still by you damn it oh he's doing tommy he's in the chemical more zombies then zombies in the middle that's me [Music] have you got the inhalers i've got a load of the inhalers are you in the trains i'm just on top of this uh crate whatever it is it's going to pay try and try and try and try and try and try to get you yeah yeah oh no we're gonna go basically can't save you oh my god i'm getting absolutely pummeled vilador took everything from me what health is the boss on uh could you get it to the next stage yeah i'm getting there it's filling this whole place with i can't do anything tom i can't move i can't ping it's just can you see i can see yeah i can see what's going on i mean there's two floating rocks in front of me he's lagging around everywhere i can't see his healthcare now i can see your health i think if you get him dead there might be like a cutscene that will like bring me to the next section or something yeah i'll do my best like he just doesn't stand still for one second you've got any arrows there we go back screen loading why this is another i'll stage myself let's see for my theme well it's it's our last chance you've always been like this aiden honest noble that's why she loved you so much it was the politicians the gre cowards and noble citizens that took everything from us good job tom they stopped my research turned you and all the other children out into the street they knew these tests were our only chance to find the cure for my daughter for everyone you know i want to save me same as you but there's gotta be another way there is better there's more time there's gonna be more is there is you haven't seen my final form why are you even trying to save a city that's caused you nothing but pain and suffering yes that's not true i've met good people here men women children all fighting to stay alive to stay human oh that's why it's called stay human would you sentence them all to death the what would she say if she knew knew that everyone died because of her procedure you're right aidan you're right oh can you see that rock in the background tom she wouldn't want this yeah that's fine i see three rocks up agent that's why she cannot find out ever [Music] he's turning what's not now we turn nope not yet just die please let it be over i can glide now tom oh group yeah i forgot how crucial that is during a gunfight yeah oh sorry i made a fight i just almost killed myself rather good [Music] i've used all my med kits i've used all of my grenades give me some help yeah i'm sorry i'm fun up there i yes i'm gonna see if i can craft anything hold on i don't think you're gonna have the materials to do it molotov shock arrows that could be useful oh my god any shock arrows no my grenades he's strong he's too strong he's too strong [Music] [Music] oh my god i mean you could say that hold on i'll try these uh shock arrows [Music] oh my god oh my god i went to gravel jack and i pulled out my uv light and i fell on the ground you're dead i'm waiting for a revive between some uh i will run can i even get to that song i don't know i i went between the like servers whatever in between concrete i found a hidden area just kill yourself kill yourself oh my god you can't like skip or no there's nothing i can do other than drop out of the game and you reinvigorate me i've fallen and i can't get up there was a gap between the walls i think you can go through it i see it on the other side i see the columns on between what you think i can res you you can get yeah ground floor stay on the low level find like a gap between the big concrete columns and walk through all wall run through and hopefully we can warm back down down here i can't look behind me i'm facing the way i came in i just don't see how it would get out of there thomas do you see me like through the game yeah but i can't get through the gap no no it won't let me through the game we'll run it how i ended up here i don't know are you doing it i can hear you starting around i'm trying to wall run it but it won't let me in [Music] shall i drop out and you can invite me yeah okay just find a safe place it's like the boss isn't doing anything he's just like yeah he just stands there there's so much high ground in that place let me know when you want invite yeah go again jesus man it's not how hard you get knocked down tom it's about how hard did you get the invite yeah give me a sec i'm gonna have to keep puffing on these inhalers as well okay with you okay let's go tom great start i sneezed mid glider you coming up here you can just climb i woke up in chemicals where is he right now right at the top if you jump up here with me i've got mines again gosh that's my mic i got a massive sneezing fit um over to you yeah we gotta go up that onto him come up here just jump up come with me is he up here though yeah well we can't drop kick him no i can hit him with the arrows and then you just go and do that and then you whack him so hit dodge whack repeat why is he on fire because i've got uh the flame mod [Music] i'm out of arrows now yeah i mean monty it goes up here we go shh you have to hold space i think you're tapping it oh i'm down tom okay i'm coming down i'm turning i'm turning mid-fall are you are you joking are you up yeah i jumped down to use my glider and before i could use my glider my guy starts doing the zombie turning assassination he got fighting up here you can do the infinite climb i think with the zombies i don't know gravity [Music] yeah zombie oh my god what the hell is this i can't control my movement in mid-air all right go ham i'm turning again listen i'm leaving it up it can't be any more stages spot kick him off come on six hours tom i've been live how long six hours when was the last time you did that ever you've always been eight years ago wow stronger than the others but you chose to run away what's the key i don't want to kill you you look at the infected like they're the disease you fight them for the last ray of dying light yet you can't see that we're only separated from them by a few minutes of darkness the key is with mia in the machine that will finally cure her raiden but she no tom there's another stage you had to say you had to say the boss fight it's going to be more after this as well isn't it it's going to be more after this oh this guy's easy weird he's not really attacking us sonny we will never forget sorry jack just two hours left well zom no tom please i need food i haven't ate for like 12 hours okay we're in zombie mode this is good just jump so you can just meet over there i almost missed i almost fell off plushie did i it just let me get my bow out tom okay i don't have zombie mode now do i okay sorry what you need it i don't know like i had zero graph and then i didn't you still jumping around like a maniac yeah okay that's weird you take full damage i can murder him very easily tom man i'm like stuck in crouch mode oh great i'm turning in the chemical out cutting that has to be it please it's so weird tom it shouldn't fade to blacklight it's so weird if you played this single player which i think you should have at this stage you would have had way less issues it was so good for us yesterday why did he do the key or you'll kill everyone do you understand eat it mia go back now mia is that you hayden what happened to you yeah the key without it the city will be destroyed mia you need your ventilator i beg you it's gone too far me a hurry you need oxygen and now ten stems without it i can't cure you you've been trying to cure me for years i don't want it anymore save those people aiden no no no no no no no no no no oh my god oh my god that can't be what just happened tom i'm sorry that is breathe honey no oh my god it literally just gets vanished by some yellow vomit on the floor well it got absorbed didn't it it was like a lot of kind of like it was falling into lava it dissolved how convenient he smacked it out of our hands in a chemical lab like a madman it's hard to feel like emotional after what we've just been through tom i feel very emotional right now let me tell you i feel more emotional than i've ever felt in my life before ever you still love me yes hurry the generator it's just a whoopsie isn't it whoops gone that's literally what it is [ __ ] is she going no she's got the copium oh my god fight there you go fight on me hayden the missiles are launching soon if you were supposed to clear out of here the one oh that time for your mother head [ __ ] aiden did you get walls yes luana i found and the key it's gone what he's been destroyed luanne then destroy it aiden goddammit those missiles will obliterate the city i'm in the control room we get to be electricians again tom procedure there's a lot of parkour stuff i can see here that can be swung off all we need to do is find the right cable and plug it into a and b and then follow the black screen she's below the freaking rockets we can detonate them before they launch with the explosives that we found in that warehouse oh okay okay that that that just might work i'll go after wait what let me stop hurray what is going on we'll destroy everything just cut her off my cutscene very strange yeah very weird the pacing and the direction it's really confusing to follow because i've had i've heard like you know i've heard terrible things about the campaign dizzy we nearly finished surely i think people if they're going to play this game they should play a single player do co-op for fun like what should we do something save luanne or let alone donate the bombs is this city really worth you losing everything 15 seconds you've got to pick up let the one donate the bombs because we're saving the city all we're saving the one the one well she's got a filmmaking season three sorry i've never ever no no just take me out and leave you'll favor ayden you'll find a way i know you well she just needs more copium i failed you i'm sorry is he finally gonna die tom i'm sorry i mean look at the pool of blood he's in i think he's dead job caking to be sure oh she just shifted did you see that hold on let's just uh just i think it's just reset follow the evacuation route um okay we've got to get i got you you're safe hayden we're getting out of here luanne i've got stuttery cutscenes again sorry though i'm sorry that you had to uh enjoy this with me i hope that it hasn't ruined your um i've always liked the red ones do you think i'm gonna make red colored fireworks i want to go out in style i had fun [Applause] we'll go out together jack hold on your world your rules achievement unlocked oh we're just here now congratulations you complete the campaign a soup kitchen for the poorest citizens has been established in the city center farmers are asked to donate any unsold produce we have survived another night but many of our loved ones weren't so lucky be mindful and help those in need spider-man dlc confirmed don't you dare roll the credits have you got music now no shhh is the the font like chalked for you there's just like stripes across it's just i think it's just their style i can barely read it yeah it's like a yeah it's definitely the style it's just got like smoke through it rest in peace sloane she's one of the only good characters in the game did we make the right decision well would you rather the city got missiled that's yeah but that's what like apparently we got the worst ending out of the two which makes no sense like you've got the good enemy okay what's the other ending what happens black screen tom mm-hmm is there more there's there's five endings how we had two decisions to make or was it your choices up until that point well i can't pause the game jack so i think it's happened again just black screen i mean is there after this or is that it yeah it's happened that's it then oh in the best ending leon survives too how do you do that i don't know i i presume it's the choices you make up until that point and there's an end cut scene we've got the average ending okay so so hakko needed to be alive for everyone to survive ah there you go so if you hadn't have killed hackon or let him left him to die when you did yeah we could have then you wouldn't have fought that second time you would have gone like oh we don't want to fight you anymore and then he should just say you can close the game were you streaming tom yeah oh wicked the whole time yeah start to finish you're the best oh you know how to get something out there now look look before we started this i was like i had such a good time yesterday i did as well and we ran into so much jank with a co-op today like all the bugs in one day i've i've i've played this i played for like a week and a half before the game was even available and i was so happy that it was just like working and it was all great and then co-op has like definitely shot a light on an area for the game that needs work yeah if you're going to get it definitely play through it single player because it's so much more seamless regardless of what we just went through the co-op adds a lot of new bugs that won't occur in single player i've heard a lot of people say that they have similar bugs like tommy for example yeah yeah i know that's why that's what i've heard well that's what i told you earlier like you either have all the problems or none of the problems okay we waited long enough i imagine in that chunk there was credits that didn't appear then so there's there's been a lot of junk with a co-op tom got something out of it the game play the game play is a 9.5 out of 10 i'll come back and play it and do all the co-op stuff and do whatever messing around parkour is always fun the parkour in this game for me is like the web swinging in the spider-man game like it's just really enjoyable i'll go back to it for the same reason um and you know dying like one had a core audience beyond the campaign it's just something to keep the you know as you're progressing your character something to keep you i've got three fps car seats again someone's gonna watch this slide show before there's a guy walking into a bar song yeah i see him walking up her upper ramp in three fps is it um jack matt yep it actually looks more badass this way there's no music i've got music finally it's fun as hell this game even though we had to endure a lot of pain there [Music] i'm glad co-ops are featured now we're not four months down the line but if they had delayed it i would have understood they should have delayed the card yeah yeah the co-op wasn't available in the review phase of us playing the game it only got added when the game released so it's spike it's not um sorry i'm watching this into fps jack i'm very sorry and that woman is walking through that man and nothing surprises me yeah i've gone from no bugs in 35 hours to all the bugs in the end game so i might like like you said earlier jack is dead might just be the later half as i mean is tested i feel like the bit in the middle is the sweet spot though with this game 100 when you first get the grapple hook and like the glider arguably i've been enjoying the side quests more than some of the main story stuff like some of them are pretty fleshed out set pieces are cool in this main story but wherever the road took it i'm actually watching this in three years i'm going to i think they're trying to figure out what happened to aiden right i'm going to drop out of the game and bring up your stream i feel like that's a better idea than watching this in 3 fps [Music] if i can even click drop out in 3 fps it's a black screen again tom so what did you just watch um spike walked into the bar they had a chat with the barman and then they wanted to know what had happened to aiden [Music] and now it's a black screen oh here we go from what i've heard well i dropped out so you can carry on otherwise you'll be waiting for me to actually get through it before you can proceed lived only for a couple more hours four hours buried her under an older what amir [Music] to usually meet mayor in the last five minutes of the game taking a drug that was destroying him people like him are better off on the road as a pilgrim [Music] he's off time he's going away good night and good luck isn't that from the first game like the first trailer wasn't it uh it's from the opening [Music] you know when the game opens up yeah and you've got um there's the credits rosario does the [Music] me okay here we go [Music] that's gonna be the longest video on my channel six hours and twenty minutes well you wanna see it one stream is that after it fades to black credits okay hope you enjoy this gaming experience look it's complicated [Music] gg gg's in the chat see regardless people won't won't be rushing the game the way we did i wouldn't recommend you do it like that because we didn't have any of the gear that we really needed by the end and we had no resources to make stuff um the only gear we needed was the drop kick and c4 nades like i'm so glad i didn't die when you got stuck in that stand imagine restarting yeah that was a lot though that was a lot i've got one more code to give away i forgot i'll put it in the chat now [Music] okay so i reviewed this at the start of the play session and i said up until the point that we started the stream i said the story was a six game [Music] [Music] i gamepl say gameplay outside of the main story is still a 9.5 fun as hell in the main story we had some bugs that prevented us from doing normal gameplay things story for me it's gone down a level a five it's average but it works for a game like this it doesn't need to be anything more but it would have been nice to have a surprise it was cool that we got rosario and she was the highlight of all the actors in it a lot of them just like had a really weird delivery and then the fun factor i mean in this session i'd say it was a six there was a lot of funny moments so that's probably because of the bugs yeah by the end i feel like we're both holding on for their life but it's still a good time with friends yeah at this stage play it through solo and then do all the co-op fun and do side quests and just have a laugh with all of the maxed out abilities and stuff or just like when you go to do a co-op session just do that stuff don't try and proceed with the story because it does add some jack i mean they seem pretty devoted you'll remember this isn't a triple a studio they don't have like a massive budget behind them they're about as indie as a aaa game can get so not to say uh you know should be excused but [Music] i do think um it should be considered but it was fun it's a fun game there you go regardless of the bugs it's still let's be let's face it it's one of the the better aaa games i've released in recent recent memory don't judge it off this play session hope you enjoyed it regardless yeah i think so yeah i think people like watching it fun memes even just like us trying to get through the bugs i'm sure it was entertaining why do you think had you finished this solo you wouldn't have had you know 60 of the problems yeah but you didn't know that yesterday when it all it was was fun sheer fun anyways summer thank you very much yeah that was really good i appreciate you playing with me of course
