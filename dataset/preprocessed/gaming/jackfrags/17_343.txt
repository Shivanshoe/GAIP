there's john rambo there i've been very serious he's about to enter the war zone right we need to drop early because we're gonna go to this building here we'll find some cool stuff there i promise that was rude i'm just trying to get my thing and you're trying to shoot john rambo out of the air like that unbelievable okay so that's the one that we need to land at apparently there's some cool stuff in here let me show you all right we're on the ground elimination and we've got a guaranteed combat bow which is the new kill streak explosive bow and we've got this as well so if you hold use on that it takes a couple seconds you'll hear some weird noises but once that's done open up your map and you'll see these green circles and these are little new pow camps where you can get these dog tags for the event and some loot just a little thing also that's not all oh no oh hello thank you very much for that satchel let's also disappear send coordinates so you press this and it does a bombardment on the map [Applause] so if anyone's around you hopefully it'll kill them yes yeah destroyed around the vehicle but it also causing that attack helicopter now that is not a friendly attack helicopter and if you take it out let me show you what happens oh that boat's cool two shots it drops a heavy weapons crate and i've seen a couple things in this it takes a while to capture it's kind of like the juggernaut do you remember the juggernaut box you can use it and move around it so hopefully i don't get sniped in the face what do we get we got a sigma a vex lord xm4 and some dog tags there we go i think i need like one more of those dog tags maybe and then i've completed the event i'm not sure all right see if we can get some cash get yourself a loadout thanks for all tuning into the video today guys if you're enjoying it leave a like thank you comment down below a lot of you guys tell me that you love the solo gameplays so there'll be more coming up i like playing them too because i'm a masochist oh hello if i can do you think i could take that out oh man i've got to go and see because that boat was really really strong against that attack helicopter but i don't know how good it will be against the real truck let's see a little bit of damage it's not much at all really is it's going to jump out ah forgot me fair play got trolls going there too didn't seem to stop the arrows though did it or when the guru lag will come back you never know no chill sometimes if you just get behind some cover in the gulag and wait more often than not you'll get that kill so there is a camp here somewhere so these are new look got a buy station little building here it's very rambo isn't it john mcclane got a whole entire tower john rambo just gets a few huds that's something's got the lowly there little fight going down i'll find you oh they slowed the rate of fire down on this massively cool scope though this is small rangefinder on it yes i'm gonna fight he's on top of one of these silos i think they just get their load out there come on grumpy monk unfortunate for some there were several positions there where i wouldn't have been able to see that guy oh my god that's a lot of loot we've got ram seven 198 i'll take it thank you i was going to use the ram 7 for this anyway so i could just get my ghost load out this is so open though look at this why did it drop my load out here in the middle of this red pool oh my goodness whatever please don't go with me please don't kill me it's fine it's fine i mean i could scope those loadouts out of the corner yeah ow i just got absolutely hammered then what was it [Applause] down there yeah they're going for their loader on there i'll go back this side missed crack airspace is too crowded yeah i was going to drop that right on them but they were looking over there so losing ground oh this guy's annoying i'll find you gonna get a sniper bonk is there still the other load out there yeah there is where is that up here the bye no i don't want to go over there activision grand prix that was an old game wasn't it they released that's gotta be from the 80s though look at that what system was that on pop quiz i don't know the answer if you know the answer let me know down in the comments amigo or something commodore okay there's someone going cam here in this building what gun was that i don't know let's go find out is that in there well that was him no he's gone really bad time to get in there in the back [Applause] where's that from [Applause] dude where were you i don't know where that was from it was suppressed [Applause] guy up here still i said the old vehicles isn't it let's go on from here one behind me as well let's get position right here yeah this guy is sick two people here they're gonna have a fight is that a head yeah it is you know what you know over make it a big example time [Applause] i think we're good i'm gonna stick to this north side though because i don't really want to have to cross the airport they've actually removed a lot of the cover there you know it's horrible the guy here did you see me i don't think he saw me i don't want to chance it though where are they going they could still be in that building and they run across i'll find you sometimes you just gotta be patient wait for the right shot and it'll come hopefully there's no one just ratting around here in a bush i always like to ping those bushes just in case you never know i've gotta go so i shouldn't be on that uav police would be a really good spot if i can take it anyone in there [Applause] i thought i can see should we go for it oh it's dubious i'm gonna go for it okay they've seen me and they were just scoping out the same that i would do no that's one of the hell they're gonna have to push down though aren't they where were they only 10 remain you're nearly done guys i don't see them i don't know where that guy's gone [Applause] it's like someone just finally shot at me and disappeared safe zone relocated i'm just going to leave that and move because i've got to move anywhere right might as well go now i'm surprised that downed them through the glass though usually it doesn't unless they don't have plates or something now there's got to be someone in this building surely someone over there are they crawling there okay they're safe now i've gotta move down there three other people left all right well there's 100 someone in there isn't there [Music] [Applause] he's very lucky [Music] oh they've had to move [Applause] oh so where's the last one oh there he is yes oh man i love a competitive game like that gg oh man that was a really fun game i was on the edge of my seat there i was hoping the last guy though would be a down so i could do the combat bow finisher but there it is anyway guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed that as always a big thanks to everyone using my code in the cod store appreciate it thanks for all these guys
