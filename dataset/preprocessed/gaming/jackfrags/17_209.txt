on ghost face now in cold war zone my new favorite skin i think listening to it they actually got the original actor or voice actor to come back and do some voice lines specific for warzone i appreciate that it's good stuff but today we're playing some iron trials solos and we'll be taking a look at the new warzone map caldera throughout the past week really call of duty have dropped massive blogs with information screenshots news about how the warzone integration with the map is going to work with vanguard all that good stuff and i wanted to take a look at it today because there's some really interesting and also bizarre stuff going on here that i didn't think we would see in warzone so i haven't really played warzone properly for a couple weeks now i think it was october 16th when i played that random match with those french people you know the one i posted that went really well the weekend after that i tried the new halloween mode the haunting and i don't know it's just just not as fun as it was last year being honest with you guys i don't know whether that's the fact that it's ghost now instead of zombies or you need three things to come back to life rather than two there's less chaos you've got the safe zones it just wasn't doing it for me so i played a few rounds with a couple people on the discord and i don't think i'm gonna touch it again to be honest with you but this is solo iron trials correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they've done solo iron trials before and i love this game mode it changes a lot of fundamental things with the game and in solos you know there's no birthers no trucks no dead silence no stopping power loadouts are much harder to get time to kill is much higher i love it i think it's great it just removes a lot of crutches from the game and i really like that so i only played one match of it this morning this is the match that you're watching here it went really well thought it was quite interesting so this is the one we're going with today as i attempt to take out an enemy and get beamed by this dude camping in a window just railed me absolutely dumped on look at this ruined but at least i got to experience the og gulag they've put that back in before the map is destroyed and gone forever and we switched to this new one caldera so we're gonna talk a bit about that now i believe based on the info i read in the blogs the new map will launch on december the 2nd so people have time to play the multiplayer level up their guns give that a bit of breathing room and then they're just going to go full whack on warzone also they put this in the blog get this warzone pacific now has seven studios working on it seven developer studios are working on this game crazy and in the run-up to the new map releasing there's going to be two events in warzone the first one is called operation flashback and they said that this is to celebrate the dance because it's going away and this will be classic moments and many more in a limited time mode featuring plenty of surprises that cover the action-packed history of verdansk nothing more than that yet but maybe it will be a playlist where there's different versions of the map mashed together like a bit where the stadium is fully built a bit where it isn't nakatomi plaza the underground station comes back i don't know but that'll be interesting to see and then there's the end of the dansk towards the end of november and all we get for that is expect a spectacular and fitting end to your time in vedanska as we say farewell to the custodian city forever with a question mark maybe the map will get news again who knows so they shed some new screenshots here and i have to say the overall look and feel of the map i'm really into it they said the size is approximately about the same as this one so it's going to be big but it seems like it's much more open and there's a less built up urban area so the fighting will be different in that respect it's much less about building to building and more using natural cover rocks elevation there's a lot of streams and water here too so i'm wondering can we swim now or will you just die when you run into the water again i don't know there's a lot of playlists here with the map too so there are some that are specific for vanguard where you can only use vanguard weapons and vehicles and they have stuff like planes that you can actually fly in them you didn't mishear me a guns a trucks but then you've also got the normal battle rail modes for the new map in that in the normal vr mode you can use any weapon from modern warfare cold war vanguard you can use any operator all the calling cards or the skins customizations that you've accrued over the last couple years playing this game it will all be available for you in those normal battle royale game modes on the new map but the vanguard specific game modes it's getting a bit complicated isn't it you can only use vanguard things and they said that they think this will give the opportunity for new players to learn the game level things up when it releases rather than just being killed by meta gaming gods over and over again i'm not sure how popular the vanguard specific modes will be i feel like maybe they're splitting up the player base a bit too much here but at least this will be a new thing and brand new experience for warzone and the fact that they've got the planes in that you can take off and fly and shoot other planes with and do strafing runs on people on the ground starting to feel a bit different that isn't it starting to get a bit more like battlefield in that respect i'd love to give it a go see how it plays rebirth island will be staying as well so if you're someone who still plays warzone regularly and you enjoy that smaller more hectic more action-packed arcade game mode experience that's gonna be there as an option i don't think they're changing it yet but i assume that there will be some changes to it as the life cycle of warzone vanguard continues to grow maybe they'll introduce another new smaller map i'd love to see that rebirth is fine but it doesn't feel like real battle royale to me it just feels like a kick about at the football pitch but it's obviously super popular especially with the more casual players the main map in the game in general over the past what like six months or so that's just become an absolute sweat fest like a lot of the casual players have just stopped and i think this is a problem that's inherent with battle royale games they have a bit of a shelf life and i was maybe thinking of doing a full video on this at some point because i think it's a super difficult problem to fix and warzone's probably been hemorrhaging players for a while now it's probably really difficult for them to get new players in as well because of the way the game's designed with the loadout system how meta everything is new players just don't stand a chance and they're not going to have fun here so maybe the only way to get a resurgence in that again is if modern warfare 2 releases next year november they wipe the slate clean with warzone infinity ward have built a brand new warzone experience they kill off everything for the last three years so modern warfare cold war vanguard all goes away and they bring up their warzone 2.0 let's say some new innovations completely new weapons they wipe the slate clean people start again they get that influx of new players could be a potential option for the future there but the new pacific map and these vanguard specific vanguard only playlists will help in that respect because everyone will have a chance again and if they ramp up the spmm so if you're someone who's been playing fourzone for the last two years you're going to be putting lobbies with people of similar skill and playtime to that and the new players can have this pseudo fresh start with the game it won't last long but maybe a couple of months and then i think we're back to where we are now at least we've got the new anti-cheat as well so in my opinion there's a lot here to look forward to and then vanguard itself i mean next week i'm going to be playing a lot of multiplayer i'll be streaming multiplayer i'll be streaming the campaign that looks really interesting and of course zombies for me personally zombies was something that i enjoyed when it came out with world of war playing that with three other friends was good fun but then after that it just got really complicated but with black ops cold war i feel like they made it a bit more accessible and for a casual zombies player like myself and like my friends we could get into that a bit more and it felt like we didn't have to know a million things about the previous zombies games to understand what we needed to do and i think because treyarch are making the vanguard zombies as well i watched a couple videos about that it seems like they've made some interesting changes with that too and of course it'll be a great way to level up your guns if you're going to be playing a lot more war zones so next week's going to be pretty cod heavy i'm hoping that we'll get more battlefield news or gameplay next week as well because that's literally two weeks away for early access you can play battlefield 2042 on the 12th of november that's right around the corner not long to go at all so pretty exciting you could be damn sure i'll be playing that on the 12th as well it's gonna be a busy couple weeks i've been really action-packed a lot of stuff to look forward to here and i'm excited to be making videos streaming and hopefully you guys are enjoying the content at the moment so endgame here 1v1 one my gulag come back picked up a few kills here and there looking for the heartbeat sensor off this dude that i just taken out there they are and i'm just too chunky to get through the window but fortunately that guy didn't have any armor plates and just got the hot beam of the lifetime got the victory there's the win and that's my one warzone game for the day there it is what can you do eh but thank you for watching guys i know a lot of you still play warzone and still enjoy watching my warzone videos i built up a big warzone audience over the last 18 months or so it isn't going away and i know that a lot of you are still using my code in the store and tweeting me pics like thank you so much for that it's a great help honestly with that said enjoy the rest of your day whatever you're doing if you like the video leave a like
