star wars jedi survivor has finally been revealed and i could not be more excited about this one as it's a sequel to jedi fallen order from respawn entertainment one of my favorite ever star wars video games and whilst the only footage they revealed was a cinematic trailer there are a ton of things to note in that as well as a load of gameplay details and information about the game released via interviews and social media accounts and i've scoured the interwebs to bring you everything we know so far about this game and there's some really interesting stuff here from the top then this game is set to be released in 2023 no specific date yet and it will be playable on pc playstation 5 and xbox series s and x it will not be available on ps4 or xbox one this is purely a next-gen game or current gen game if you want to look at it that way and they did elaborate a bit on why in an interview that we'll take a look at shortly if you've played the original game you'll know what type of game this is action adventure big story beats moments upgrade paths with a focus on exploration and melee combat with a few force powers thrown into the mix and some souls-like mechanics too baby's first souls game was thrown around a lot for the first game as for the setting jedi survivor picks up five years after the events of jedi fall in order which intriguingly puts it in the same time zone as the new ob1 series and the solo movie so potential for crossovers there not that i think that there will be many calcus is still the main character here and he must stay one step ahead of the empire's constant pursuit as he begins to feel the weight of being one of the last remaining jedi in the galaxy accompanied by bd1 it's a little droid cow will meet and ally himself with an array of unique and interesting characters on his journey jedi survivor will expand on the series dynamic combat in new and innovative ways to survive kal must learn new skills and grow his connection with the force in terms of the graphics on this game the first game looked great but i do think that this has the potential to look incredible stig asmussen who is the director on the first game and the new one said this in an interview with starwars.com answering a question about how the new consoles have enabled this game to improve so i think the biggest thing is ray tracing or lighting that allows us to do real-time lighting all the time at a fidelity that's beyond anything that we've ever produced before since it's real time we get to see the changes as we tweak the lights immediately essentially that means that we have more time to polish that means that we can iterate more and we can get better results that feel more filmic now what we saw in the teaser trailer obviously a pre-rendered cinematic although the character models and environments in that are a big improvement on the original but i reckon that there's a good chance that this new game will be running on unreal engine 5. the previous game used unreal engine 4 so respawner already familiar with that ecosystem and moving to next gen and pc only i'd bet that means unreal engine 5 and we've already seen how good that looks today so i'm expecting big things here in terms of graphics environments and lighting he elaborated on this further beyond that we have these blazing fast drives on these consoles that are allowing us to load tons of content really quickly i've always worked on streaming games games that don't have load screens the fact that these consoles have such fast storage has made it even easier those are probably the two biggest benefits playstation 5 has got some really interesting haptics on their controller that we're digging into and it's just an easier process in general so it looks like that there won't be any loading screens in this game thanks to those faster drives haptics can be quite fun too if done well but ultimately those hard drives can be used to load much bigger areas and open up the scope of the gameplay which i'm looking forward to and in terms of gameplay they said that that will change and innovate too on what they had in the first game and stig said the following about reviews and critique of the first title the points good and bad were fair and those are things that we used to grow and build on the next game also this game has been in development since before jedi fallen order released in november 2019. he said here so we started working in earnest even before we finished jedi fall in order with ideas of what the second game could be there were a lot of things that we left i guess you would call on the editing room floor from jedi fall in order that we knew we wanted to put into a sequel some of that comes down to like more stances for combat or where we're going to go with the story how cal and the crew are going to evolve and grow how we're going to approach the world and the levels in the game and expand them and make them more vibrant than they've been in the past so more stances and combat options i'm into that i'd love to see actual dual wielding of lightsabers in this one in the first game you could use a single and double ended saber but there was no dual wield so that would be great to see also i did go back and play the first game recently and the combat is a bit clunky when you compare it to something newer like eldon ring so hopefully that's been tightened up and worked on a bit to get those lightsabers feeling a bit more brutal and precise also i do wonder if they'll go with a more open world approach with this one or just craft something more linear like uncharted the first game was much more like a metroid star with a lot of backtracking so a change of pace would be nice in my opinion as for the tone of the game it looks like they're sticking with the dark and gritty nature of the original stig mentioned here that the game is all about survival that's why it's called jedi survivor they're in dark times and cal and the crew are doing whatever it takes to stay alive that might mean that they are making connections with people that in other times might be considered unsavory some of that is portrayed in the trailer and again i don't want to give anything away but there's definitely a sense of i don't want to spoil anything sorry cal's relationship with his droid bd1 will continue to evolve too they'll be more connected than ever in this game and both characters are a constant consideration when building the game in terms of the story and the gameplay and that's about all of the gameplay details that we know so far as for the trailer itself there's a lot of questions and intrigue at the forefront who's the narrator who's acquired cal's lightsaber this guy a lot of people assumed initially that this could be the grand inquisitor but it's not it's rather a new character who's from the same race a pow-and there's a couple of reasons that we know this on the official star wars website the caption for this image here says it's an imperial senator making a dangerous deal on kurosan also this guy doesn't have the yellow green sith eyes and he doesn't have the markings on his head that the grand inquisitor has and is just in general a bigger character in stature overall it did definitely create a bit of confusion though as the grand inquisitor shows up in ob1 very recently and of course star wars rebels who's in the back to tank to me it looks a bit like cal so it could be a clone of him with longer hair which i think would fit into some of the themes in the first game with the light side dark side bit but i feel that that's been done so many times in star wars the clones thing and i'd prefer it to be a new character also cal does have a blaster here and we now know that his lightsaber is taken at some point so there could be plenty of blaster action in this one some third-person shooting mechanics maybe or perhaps it's just part of his hiding from the empire and attempting to blend in no idea who this character with the red saber is might be an inquisitor maybe not and of course the mantis is back that's the ship from the first game right at the start we can do a little fly through of it here although it looks to have crashed or been derelict for a while you can see the footsteps walking away there and we only got a little mention of the previous crew of the mantis from stig but i'm sure that we'll see them again as they were all very well fleshed out characters in the first game and that's about it for today folks i am super excited for this one i think that respawn did such a good job with the first game the story the gameplay it was all fun for me and it was a breath of fresh air to get a solid fleshed-out star wars single-player game after what feels like so long fingers crossed for this one do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like
