hi everyone and welcome to some battlefield one live gameplay commentary today we are playing on argonne forest oh my god that's a flamey boy i need to try and kill that guy come here play me boy and get behind him okay he's dead rudely interrupted my introduction there oh god i'm dead that's fine so [Laughter] if you didn't know already bf1 is free at the moment it's not an ad it's just if you have amazon prime and you link it to your twitch account prime gaming you can what did i spawn into oh my god you can go on twitch and claim battlefield one for free and i think it's until august the fourth or something and i just think it's an awesome game i mean a lot of the guys are probably watching this right now you've got yo you've got bf1 right but maybe your mom needs a key or your dad needs a key or your goldfish you know whoever needs a key one of your mates you can go and claim an extra one for free and give it away and then be someone's best favorite friend for a couple days and then they realize that they don't actually like you that much and you don't like them and really it was never meant to be but you know what i'm saying right like it's it's free and it's an awesome game i love the atmosphere of this game i wanted to play argon forest today and just shotgun people you know you ever get that feeling when you just want to run around the forest and shotgun people in bf1 i get that way way way way way way way too often i think i've also had too much sugar today but yeah it's okay bit of sugar every now and again never hurt anyone what it did because you you can have you definitely have too much sugar and that's a problem so watch out for that ah i thought i could just run in there and shock in that dude there's gas everywhere i need to remember the gas it's all about the gas in this game gas everywhere there's no medics because i've been revived once medics one of those don't know anymore i like the music though i can tell you that i love the music in this game i'm a bit rusty aren't i missing a lot of shots here i need to get my aim locked in watch out for those guys coming at me i think you need to aim a bit as well don't you with the uh the model 10. that's a tripwire bomb you know someone else can run into that oh no no no no no no don't run into it don't run into it what's my secondary or the peacekeeper let's go i can hear people i think there's someone right here creeping around with his lewis gun who's he in gears eh yeah i missed that first shot what's wrong with me it's definitely the sugar get him get him get him shoot fire fire nice shot mate i don't know if you hit anything but it was a good shot i'm gonna go with it was a great it was a good shot good shot mate love it that's uh that's way too many enemies for me to deal with with a shotgun i don't want to go back there the flame up yes give it to me give it to me oh yeah chef frags is back in the house i'm sure there was someone right here on the radar wasn't there where'd they go i can hear them that's right you burn let the other guy go i don't know i'm gonna go around here there's a lot of people on b it's not ow no no no no no no i'm not having now back here dude just going crazy with this semi-auto thing medic medic yeah legend oh god assault player right here oh they're too far away i'll throw the fire grenades on and i can go in that because i've got my um my anti-flame suit on hey no i just saw someone here right you got to be dead are you dead surely you're dead i'm on 28 sp guys no cut down in my prime by the mondragon storm it's a weird name isn't it man that was going to be such an epic kill streak but yeah it was all right we've got a few kills anyway this spawn now i wanted that spawn there there's some lads right here i'm sure i saw one across here but we'll let it slide for now man i'll miss this i haven't played this map for ages like this was one of my favorite things to do in bf1 david oh god they threw a grenade at me i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead why did i push that i'm an idiot yeah i'm an idiot i'm putting too much faith in the shotgun you know that's what it is kill assist 10. feels mad man i mean we've got a lot of the map here you know we've got people flanking a and b as well so this is good when i joined i think we only had the d point speculative grenade there look at this huh oh we're fine we're fine that there's someone right there yeah there is look that's a fire grenade it's okay just miss me look at this bad boy on the water i stand in front of them that doesn't work anymore obviously there was a point where that worked and you could just stand in front of people and they'd find them all at you and kill themselves not great for team play though all right mask on mask off see how smooth that was that was a one-hit kill oh my goodness dude this thing is sick i'm spawning right there there must be a spawn point here in with the ewoks i thought i had an enemy shooting then let's go you're friendly or see that's where you need to be aiming with the hunter that distance unless oh god it's fine it's fine somehow roger roger roger thank you thank you roger i appreciate you raj big rog coming in clutch are we clear i think we i think we're on the point yes big rodge that wasn't even big grudge was it i don't know what i'm saying anymore again too much sugar today there was a donut you know went out somewhere there were donuts i can't i'm so dead i can't say no to a donut i can't do it if there's a fresh donut and you get that smell you're not donut that fresh donut smell oh hot donut bit of sugar on it bit of cinnamon maybe no no no there's no i literally i can't i can't say no i don't have the will power oh it's been locked i'm gonna throw that in there again another speculative grenade didn't get anything without one though did a bit of fishing not enough bait on the end i've never been fishing in real life i've heard it's quite therapeutic though someone'll have to take me one day right there's going to be a lot of enemies here that did so much damage they're in here get behind him [Music] naughty boy thrown on the ground you know what i reckon yeah i was gonna say i reckon there's more here okay right i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead no we're fine can't put i was gonna say i don't have dynamite do we could easily be flying right now i want to go this way though there's lots of kills here if we can get up ah that was poor roger roger i know you're right there raj come on roger eight meters roger i'm looking he's dead roger's dead send in the cav ten meters eight seven six five four three two one let's go beautiful beautiful res love that energy that's a grenade that's another grenade come on walk in there walk in there let's go let's see what happens uh sorry the flashbang since when was that since when is that why is there a flashbang where did you come from dude there are things in this game i don't understand oh no lick my dust what a great name really thought that one out do they just have dust coming off them all the time are they a vampire all right we're back in the action i can hear him in here there was one more that went around here no oh what did that kill i was dead anyway right like i mean this entire british army's there as far as i'm concerned and they've got a train now as well i mean that was a nice little kill streak though you know i'm feeling it i feel like the aim has come back jack i like your vids man hello mom hi dad yep let's go with that oh dear take g fuel and inject it into my veins i'm just kidding i don't don't do that that's not not a good idea oh look how good this looks man this game came out in 2016. this is one of the original maps as well i can't wait for bf 2042 honestly that's a shotgun off yeah i'm so excited for that game kobe that looks good that's a gas grenade again well we've got a tag with it no killer oh come on teammates you gotta bat me up there you gotta you send me after nice cheats oh someone's cheating guy arson where are they on the other team i don't think they're cheating okay i'm gonna wait here you weren't supposed to see me yeah stick out like a sore thumb there don't i should i go and see the train i'll tell you what i'm gonna switch to dynamite i'm going to put dynamite on there right there like that or the train's there though it's thomas the dank engine thomas thomas please i wanted to make friends with you he cast me aside and just threw me down the river why can't trains be nice to us are we losing see i'm slowly getting it back i didn't want to spawn next to the train you ruined me pathetic pathetic dynamite though that cannon's ruined doesn't it are the flame boys back now as well i kind of want it here's someone here yeah that's a bad idea going up there bad news bears here's someone up here gas grenades right can't take that fight that's a medic with an slr probably absolutely ruin me and someone has actually used tripwire gas grenades there oh no they're fire grenades okay i don't mind those i think they're pretty decent but the gas grenades there's no way i'd be using them okay we're behind we're behind all right this guy doesn't have a clue oh someone was watching the back train tracks i should have just turned around shouldn't i hey he just got gated out of existence into the nether realm okay it's a good spawn oh no that's not a good spawn that's not no come on roger roger raj roger oh roger's dead again i feel like roger's as he's left he's let me down more times than he's helped me that was the train here i mean the train was oh god no that grenade rodge rush just every time i see you run you just get skilled straight away i mean fair play though yeah they back capped us there but oh they've taken the whole map back i blame thomas yeah it's all about that train thomas is dead so it's a good start i guess right this is a bit risky yes i know you're there i'm trying to just get away i can get underneath and get you back that'd be great i'm gonna get down here what's the one on my right when you take this point back it's that gimme flag so it's important lads come on take it back take it back the hell oh they're both i think here they come come on lads right above us they're actually almost out camping that's why i'm going up there that'll do one more over there right we got it but we need to clear it now i think i'm back are we good no there's one more down here okay we're good we cleared it good job lads right now we are still winning but oh man we need to take some points back quick these looking good might be a nice route here to see although see i don't like being in this kind of position when i've got a shotgun i like being the sneaky boy there's another one here i think they just threw a grenade medics trying to res are we clear i think we might be clear here now quick reload of the shotgun let's get this clank on several on the minimap here oh that medic was doing a decent job there going for those revives fair play how we doing on school oh man i don't know this is going to be so close goodbye fbi open please we lose knee again no i thought i saw it move there for a second okay okay okay not many tickets in it oh i don't know they're holding this pretty bad nah don't go that way do not go that way you're dead if you go that way gotta go through the center right on the other side of this hillside you know this reminds me of it reminds me of the forest from the force awakens you know when they go and see mars in the castle and they get attacked that's what it looks like but they actually film most of that in the uk but this is obviously in in france right argon forest yeah it's french i think we're gonna get the window here gg gg well played
