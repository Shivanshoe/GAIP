hello guys and welcome back to call of duty warzone season two yesterday we jumped in for a few hours and checked out some of the new stuff but today i'm going to be focusing on one of the new guns the new lmg and we might check out the second one as well the assault rifle but i've not really leveled that one up that much on like level 10 with it so i don't know how good it would be but i have built like a meta build for the lmg even though i've not maxed it yet i will check it out and see how good it is and uh also we'll be hopping in to a couple of the new locations maybe i'll get to try the bomber as well yesterday i did have a quick go in the bomber but i was only ever like on the guns in it so i'd love to actually like fly the thing around because i've seen some mad clips online where people just get like insane kill streaks with it so we'll give it a shot we also went to the new factory as well it's got like a big button in it that you can press and flip the whole thing with gas so hopefully we'll head back there too if i can knock it shot out of the sky that'd be good and we might actually try some iron trials later on as well because i think they've got iron trials on resurgence so there's like a ton of new stuff in the game [Applause] and we'll be live for the next few hours guys thank you so much for tuning in a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one as well i am a cod partner if you guys pick anything up in the card store do consider using my code which is jack frags in caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that really difficult to do introductions while i'm trying to actually play the game at the same time but yeah the i think the biggest improvement for me really is is the colors and the visibility maybe i should unmute and actually be a good teammate okay let's see yeah i think it might have been the guy above you stud really shot from behind are there a lot of people around here lads yeah yeah yeah but it's fire here i think we just took out three clusters on the top of the roof above me they're on the roof are they no i've killed three of them i got the one above the roof there's a guy in here cheeky res yeah i'll come to the rest cam cool i'm in the corner should be fine with my white outfit definitely blended in hello is that one of the new outfits or something like why are you wearing this yeah from the battle pass chat all right he's up on that hill all the way in the distance okay let me [Applause] don't expose yourself don't do it if i go to the roof he's being shot from somewhere else he's down i need a rest guys i'm safe hang on i've got men everywhere jack on the hill run yeah that guy up there he's trying to draw you i got two men there yeah that guy on the hill is insanely accurate like like he's he is a pod oh he didn't at me is that wireless yeah someone in my chat just said cameron you kind of look like ezio from assassin's creed oh i'm playing assassin's creed in warzone that's your new title yeah that's my title i'll change it now all right we need to get round and kill these men that are on the hill your teammates study them they're no longer with us my cat just walked in front of my face in the game or in real life but in the game i didn't realize it put cats in for season two and then he crossed over when the cat went past my face and then he dropped him it's deja vu he's still up on the hill then yeah i see him he just smoothed off he's smooched it off he's smooth [Applause] load out already i yeah are we gonna look at where that is though compared to where they are you know what i mean yeah i mean anything anything to keep him away whilst i uh grab my gun have you guys tried out the new guns yet like have you maxed them i'll level them up i'm ranked 50 on the rank 50 on the new assault rifle jack isn't good it seems to be it seems to be pretty decent okay right i'm up on their level now i was going to try the lmg today but now you've said about the assault rifle i don't know it's pretty decent i'm quite i'm quite enjoying it it's got very little recoil can we get started back uh i think we should i think he deserves it okay but he deserves it go on somebody's rest as well to our 120. that's the thing that we were fighting the beamer on the hill can i go for this or am i going to get beamed by this guy no you should be okay it's fine it's fine [Applause] he's got no money left you think there's a whole team down here oh there's one involved you rest again a bit you that's just going in there yeah i mean why not always why wouldn't you just one down here on green i've whipped it out jack one on green is down i just got absolutely beamed i've only got seven bullets i'm being beam on the beach i need help over there there's a guy on me here didn't even see where he came from he's got like the worst ppsh build i've ever seen oh it like recoils into this dude that was nuts what the hell no ammo left him why would you use that he's using the maximum ttk ppsh i mean that certainly wasn't maximum ttk like what i saw like i hit the you got to hit the drop size i mean he killed me to be fair random dog [Applause] where'd this guy go yeah oh my god i i guys i thought i was gonna lose that one i have to be honest with you i was getting a bit sketchy there because i hadn't seen him can i land back down there lads is it pain seems to me good job let's go oh i want to see this man's ppsh i have to be honest with you you want to see his pee pee jack no he's ppsh there's a big difference there's a big difference is this a substantial difference you might say i can't pick it up okay yeah the kgm-40 doesn't seem to have a lot of um damage drop off over range oh my god why would you ever use that that's crazy you can hear men fighting no oh yeah on the back side of green building is cameron dealing with the doggo i feel like he is uh red marker here he's just up i don't have my sniper so i'm ruined i mean my maybe my pbs which is what i just i didn't even realize i just blew up a bloody thing over there this new ars fog can you drop me a build a bit on your ghost though that next match suck it yeah yeah thank you sorry about that i'm back nailed i've been absolutely railed yeah i mean i've got them i say pinned down i don't think so send me down if anything your teammate was sent to the gulag they'll fight the car market i can't mark it there we go orange dragon are these guys the beam has started i don't i don't know should we i haven't got a sniper i've only got an own gun soon unless they push us in which case there'll be a disadvantage anyway he's down there i just smashed him he hasn't got armor start i'm absolutely beaming him there's a guy here he hit him yeah i did two men on that cluster he's still there stopped stop he's still there i mean we can push him now i don't think i think his teammates are busy otherwise they would have shot us right i can hit him as well like through that zacky be careful there's two men there i've got a reload stud down that one on red you got an angle on him stud put him down finally look at him right here okay he's running over to his mate resin i think no he's moving put a cluster on me did you finish that guy stud yeah yeah god i'm good i'm good what's this guy got oh me he's trying to he's trying to move on me [Applause] he just raised his mate just raised his mate on me hey guys yeah this i'll tell you what i've gotten to grips with this new ar though dude dude i i was using oh he's on me i was testing the bread um yeah the new one lackey don't use the sakura mags use the 60 round extended and then put the fire rate of the recoil booster on it you get the rate of fire and you get the damage range bullet velocity and then length and ammo to give you more bullet velocity it's a pog build kind of annoying oh this is a pog build this is very good i'm gonna use the balloon here jacked huge balloon these balloons are a massive change man yeah big i think they i think they're great let's go down here two guys down there potato [Applause] what down on the green mark yeah yeah yeah should we go for a minute there yeah well maybe stod swept it up let's stop slapped it's not slurp i don't see him anymore lucky they were there they ran towards the beach that'd be them i'm just tickling him there's two of them closing the gap if you destroy a redeploy balloon while somebody's on it do they just like fall no yeah i think they what they just die i don't think they would die would they well comparatively bro keep pushing him jack keep hammering keep hammering do you want to just rush him well i'm moving in i mean i think there's only two there yeah there are rotating right yep i see them they're gone from the main building another one around the back of the circle building what's inside it i just got one around the back of the circle someone's rest one down in front of the circle one in the circle building in front of me there's a bomber guys bomber oh god he's dropping bombs okay so there's one in the circle building it might be he's just past the strike oh god on the back jack i don't see him you get him nice good job i'm from the hills jack um oh yeah yeah is there a satchel anyway guys yeah there's one here oh it's just been stolen um there is a i'll tell you what being able to play and film again as opposed to just fixing one plate allows me to be way more aggressive it makes a huge difference to play things they're pushing in they're pushing in parachuting this is a lovely bug oh and i couldn't move around the back of that building started i'm coming for you yeah i'll try and cover he's looking at me whoa that guy he's he's pushing now he's pushing me and stud it back now he's pushed us yeah it's a straw hat he should be able to wait he killed me with an automaton what the hell why can you not pen that building uh i'm being ruined you've got guests moving in lucky where are they i don't see anyone oh good job oh there you go was that the guy that killed you guys yeah yeah i killed myself in the gulag in the white outfit it's actually here jack on this girl's body saggy thank you uh i'll rest odd yay yay i'm coming back i'm coming back i have solo i don't know if you've got mates but if they are they'll come from the north i want you sad for good wherever i just want to test this ppsh okay that's a lot better than what that would be going ahead uh guy parachuting in uh quite far away 260 beams hit him a little bit enemy soldier nearby got him he had a really bad day he had a bad day a day he had a bad day and he had a bad day have you guys found the nebula bomb yet nebula fire bomb no not found the bomb found the nebula rounds quite a few times now though i want to know how big the radius is on it it's a giant bomb oh yeah no like it could just wipe out an entire point of interest a giant it never ceases to make me laugh legendary meme nice yeah it stood the test of goex a lot of times lucky what i'll meet you in my eyeball man a bit ryan gosling [Laughter] slightly more accurate fg42 and i'm here for that what this uh kgm40 yep it's not got the fire rate of the fg42 i will say that and if they add the fg42 that would be incredible yeah i was going to say there's no fg42 in the game isn't it yeah it was built for um the falsehood yeager the um the german parachutes what was the reason again it was built for the german parachute so it was built to be like fast fire rate easy to carry ammunition was it a small gun the fg-42 in reality um not really no but no it's not small but it's just the the mag that it fits in it's like maximum 20 30 rounds i think remember yeah but it was 13 bullets could be a 60 round magnet warzone you know of course there's a king king bounty i don't know i couldn't penetrate a small straw hut so who knows who knows really they're lucky [Applause] good job and there we go there's another one there's more oh neutralized no there's that next building over oh god oh god oh heavens eat seeking glaston hanina top lane we'll send does it like you yeah always i'm watching the outside look at you you're like tigers where have they gone invisible players they're gone where the hell have they gone invisible player uh is it broken it must be who did we kill uh what they got um there's a car behind us yeah it must be glitched it's not moved in ages it's not moved so it just moved it literally just moved i saw i saw it move the player under the map could well be could have glitched is it the surely it's the play we just killed because it was a big surely it was just another it was the bouncy we killed the bounty so it just goes moving but hang on like if he has glitch dude he's in the bloody bush i mean fair play to that guy like i love how we all presume yeah we all just assumed he was a glitcher or something or a book [Laughter] oh my god there's a guy down here we should get up onto the um up here guys let's go kill this man jack wants to kill the man hello we need to get to the blue houses in the little lagoon at the top otherwise it's vain i would say i think i think they're just going to the buyers huh and oh no oh no oh god that was insane oh no the gases would be that's so funny completely outplayed us because we all assume the worst yeah instantly oh he's he must be invisible or under the map or something no he was fine he was just being an absolute boss and destroying us boss it sounds like some kind of creature in the jungle that the new pokemon well it's just like a tiny little monkey or something is the bush boss if you saw that out of card you would buy that immediately what just the words pikachu with the boner no no there is there is an image i don't want to no no no but it's not it's it's it's from the show no it isn't there's no way they did that in the show let me explain so basically pikachu is lying on his back on a hospital bed yeah but his tail is sticking up through in between his legs okay and it but they've made it look very smooth instead of making it look jagged it looks very smooth and therefore don't ruin my childhood stud pikachu with the boner was born his adult film career went skilled pika boner oh oh god pain what the hell that was immediate like i'm not even kidding that was insane uh north west 300 other side of the other side of the under the bridge are they going to trust me yeah they're going to try and get to you you can get you can get to me oh god uh run away tell him to be bye-bye run away he was again camping a bush with a bren and if you not parachute dude that was insane study i'm coming here it is vanguard are we not going that bren needs to be put in the bin they keep they keep saying they keep saying apparently they're going to do iterative nerves well just put the brain in the bin because it's clearly an obvious that's right the stun grenade did delete my aim assist completely good good that's it i thought they didn't have stun grids you can you can pick them up off the ground you can pick them up off the ground you can't have them in loadouts though i got another uav you can't buy it you can't buy uavs yeah no i got one you picked one up did you although it didn't work and i've missed i've simply missed no running away running away you go back there i went for my loadout he's camping on the hill though van gaan yeah they're just camping on the hill right at the top which means our loadout will go out in the gas in this next circle i was on for a good finish there i mean we do can we we can can we get another we can't get another rest now you'd have to have the gas mask primary objective accomplished all supply boxes that's lovely ready uh no you may hold it hold it yeah we've got one going at the moment and there's one on the head there's any three of the teams left what do they do well these these are two teams here because they're split surely they're different teams maybe if someone's got a gas mask they can go to the bone no i haven't got one far behind they're looping around to that lower building the guy's beaming him from top of the hill can't i hear too slow too slow just people directly on that you might want to take this next ridge line up [Applause] oh we kind of don't look here and now you pop the uav that's still downhill guys up here we've got ghosts down one nice shot stop can we take them no they're just they're sick they're coming up the hill down the hill down there down there down there right here red marker they're literally right there yeah so those guys can fight out we've got to focus on these guys uphill how many are a pillar probably 14. i think there's a full team it's a full team look at the numbers yeah 15 players so we're actually a disadvantage right now yes we need the other teams to fight they are shooting the other teams those two those guys cheeky cheeky p okay double c4 on the door there i love that just literally i'm camping the corners are you in a bush cam are you in the house no i mean i'm in the house in the corner although getting in a bush is an advisable strategy that bush was so thick you basically just tell me when to press the button and i'll do it get ready they're coming are they coming let's still sit above us i think no they're not oh my god they're so close to us on all sides yeah there's so close on the back side as well we're about to get into this yeah you guys should just hide in the building yeah we should just hide here beside here corner counter one name one in down dead yeah jack's got ridiculous bpsh so it should be easy kills i've got bioluminescence since mp40 so yeah and d4 on the door so yeah let's let's strangle hold each other out of the game and you guys can just uh rainbow shield team six oh look they're right in the gas again oh they're in the gas why is he in the gas i mean he's probably scattered oh no oh no this is how we position don't move split left if you've got a gas mileage one red one rose how was that got me guys the c it blew the c4 up oh jack the precision blew the c4 up and killed me while i'm in the building dude come on they've got a firing range i hate that so much that's so much i can't wait what is this new sample you've got what is that oh hello [Laughter] well we just got ruined so the c4 strategy is slightly better it's fine i've got um low fps in the menu hold on um like 100 fps is that what you guys are getting um i've got 60. six thousand 160. did you just let it ride jack you just ask max max fps uh we were we were actually unlucky though we did the best we could with what we had oh dear i'm having great fun on vanguard it was ed it's good laughing you leveled up your um how far have you leveled up your your cheeky new ar my cheeky new ar is at 54 now okay well you're pro guys thank you for tuning in i hope you enjoyed that first match you want to see the lmg build yeah like i said i've not maxed it out yet but this is one of the new guns and um it's pretty good like there's barely any recall on it with that build i think maybe you could put the mx silencer on when i get that i'm not unlocked that yet though so perhaps a different grip but i'm happy with this happy with this it's just maybe different grip and muzzle on the front that ppsh was pretty nuts as well it's like the first time i've used that build c4 strategy i think the bush out did you build yeah you're right yeah i had to kind of rush that introduction a bit but uh if you're just tuning in we're playing more season two today released yesterday and there's a lot of balance changes and updates to warzone there's a new area which we didn't go to in that game but we will in one of the matches maybe this one's called the the chemical factory and it has this like weird yellow gas and there's a button in there and you can press the button and it fills up the entire factory with gas apart from the top floor so if anyone's in there you're kind of forced to leave and there's also underground bunkers too we did go and check out some of those yesterday and there's easter egg stuff as well i know you guys like watching for like easter egg stuff sometimes but um there's morse code in each of those bunkers and they spell out like 10 different phrases um and there's a content creator that i know called geeky pastimes and he like recorded them all decoded them all and made an image and there's some really interesting like phrases that have come out of that but i think that's where they're at with that easter egg like they've not found the next step or anything if there is a next step at the moment we don't really know um we've also got rebirth island iron trials as well uh i personally really enjoy the iron trials mode because it just elongates the time to kill and it removes a lot of the bs simply put from the game so we might try that at some point as well whether that's today or tomorrow in another stream we'll see and of course a couple new guns as well uh they said that they know off the brent but um it really doesn't feel like it's been nerfed because i was using it yesterday if you guys tuned in yesterday you'd have probably seen what the brand was like also i think that i fixed my crashing as well um i updated to a new driver and i had a test like yesterday because i actually crashed like twice on the stream yesterday which was kind of bad uh usually i don't crash uh in warzone um so i updated my drivers and i think i'm good in before i crashed this match and then i've got egg on my face but we'll see it may have been something to do with my overclock as well but i'm not sure because it's like really stable with other games so i don't know you know this is just how it is sometimes with pc gaming you gotta figure things out because i don't think the other guys have been crashing on warzone so there's a sticky bomb as well isn't there although is that that's only in vanguard right or is that in war zone as well can i use the sticky bomb in warzone yeah there's a bomb or two i didn't even mention the bomber we tried that yesterday i didn't get to fly it like i said at the start [Applause] so maybe i can give that a go as well but you guys saw my first impressions yesterday like that's literally the first time that i played and um yeah should have some fun games appreciate you all being here thank you guys if you're enjoying the stream do consider hitting a like what's up ethan arthur how long we going today three hours i think probably three to four hours where are we going oh no i don't think i should have jumped out then chat himself in mid-air where are we going again you know touching god i'm just getting right yeah i just jumped down because you did that stop i just basically whatever you have no idea what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you basically just don't listen to stuff i mean it's well done don't follow me here jay you keep going to them because i'm just going to go prone in a waterfall why um oh i see in real life in real life lol right coming down like it these balloons are new as well you can use them to redeploy they're all over as well you can see them in the air there's one there one there one there one there one there you just repel up them and then you can shoop like jump redeploy elsewhere really good way of getting around quickly changes up the game a lot especially if you want to play like an aggressive play style main door there's a man here um i'm gonna go here i don't know if there's anyone here though okay the aim assist was strong with that boy apparently stods off doing his own bombing run  well that's what somebody was saying todd's gone off to go and do his own bombing run i love it yeah there's a lot of ryan goslings with blue shirts on isn't there there's a lot of them it's because they don't have vanguard so they just get given i'm a ryan gosling and i have vanguard but it's because i have a cold war operator yeah we're playing vanguardian royale but that's the point you shouldn't be able to use that operator in vanguard royale i think they've allowed that one by default because it just kind of looks generic you know okay fair enough yeah fair enough you don't get the inactivity timer though if you get your loadout did you know that really yeah this shows you're engaged with the game yep i've tested it before interesting for me and this world gun are definitely going to be friends i just need to unlock it good thing you found it near valentine's day so many people come to drop on these roofs helicopter there's just no one here ah pain all right should we should we pull off and then get discovered i've ruined uh i've ruined people's fun so i'm i'm happy and i've just ruined my mute that what's up solis hello kishon hello run and jump welcome anthony 11 25 in australia go hard early boys can't stay on long thank you anthony yeah we like to play earlier in the day because the lobbies aren't a sway i know it's a bit of a luxury because like we're content creators it's our job but we get to play earlier in the day most people you know they're getting home at like 6 7 p.m and they just get put in the spm hell that's why we play earlier in the day he had to go to the restroom gabby i think hey tez so the new assault rifle someone was asking about the new assault rifle where is it i'm sure that i made a build of it and maybe i didn't it's called the oh no it's the lng sorry the lmg's the mg-40 no yeah the whitley so this one i haven't leveled up much i think i've got a blueprint for it the whitley it's a weird name isn't it that yeah the iron sight on it is terrible would not recommend 45 round mag night small cal let's get a little recoil booster for the fire rate i don't know what the barrels are got to get it leveled pain yeah i think i need to actually play some uh vanguard and level it up a bit but i know like you know jay gods he also does a lot of cod content warzone content he can he's got like a method of leveling up the guns in an hour and i think you use double xp and you do i think it's supply runs on warzone or rebirth or if you do recons on rebirth you can just level guns so fast timmy thank you for the one what's up unique name how you doing [Music] thank you so much man it's two it's eight o'clock in indonesia i'm good 6 30 in sri lanka check your gear and weapons we go [Music] yeah i think i'll have that this bad boy leveled up pretty quick though that's the ryan gosling skin although he's kind of dead at the moment it's not actually ryan gosling it just kind of looks like him so that's what we call it because we're silly from houston yeah yeah i mean it's quite early for the uh north americans usually i'm live in the evenings but as i said we uh we prefer to play earlier in the day jesus yeah yeah timmy i've got the new driver i haven't had any crashes either so now maybe that was it any sniper recommend um if you play vanguard i don't really know maybe the car 98 if you got it leveled up if you play normal battle royale swiss is by far the best sniper maybe spl second and then car 98 or car 90 above spr depending on your play style the latest episode of battlefield friends was great yeah liam i went to watch it it was really good it was funny what's up from indonesia how you doing man how do you have non-vanguard operators in royale uh rhaegar if you have a non-vanguard skin it just defaults to that one i think it's because it just kind of looks like a default man i guess i don't know what's up chris you're up early aren't you do i use nvidia fills no but i've got the sharpening on i just started using the sharpening super late now i'm way too early someone just landed on me downstairs there that looks sick all right let's go draw some local man okay right here blue margin sorry where's this gun man what is that gun don't know dude it's like a semi-auto car 98 or something like that the g43 out of the svts horrible yeah there's a guy in the wind are you taking the utter piss where has he starred did he i don't know where this guy's gone now you just run away if they survive they'll rejoin the man parachute now hostile look farmer that bomber [Applause] there's a guy in that warehouse building yeah i know i parachuted through the window and he instantly made me yeah yeah he think he was in there he could have run away yeah someone just someone just threw a throwing knife as well yeah careful they think they can hear us hundred percent yeah those are at the top above you they're above you all sandy [Applause] oh really i thought there was loads in there uh somebody's just popped a recon to our north on the sound to it the north i know it's in the warehouse oh okay did you guys try flying the bomber on mouse and keyboard yeah it was okay was it an improvement over the fighter planes yeah i think so i could actually turn it okay i might give it a go kill the man lucky pop the recon and then just ran through could have been the king you dirty little rat i hope you die he's there the whole time yeah he's just pruning waiting for us to come in cheeky i've drilled them a little bit naughty down a little bit naughty there's coming towards me that was another kill with the new gun obama's coming watch out he might bomb the loadout oh god don't you dare oh you know that bomb wasn't far off he was definitely going for it yeah he was a team coming in to their loading from the silos market if you can oh here i don't like that bomber nope he's gonna drop bombs watch out watch out he's out oh he's above us he's directly above us or the bomber boy he jumped out the bomber jumped out yeah he's dead he's dead oh god where are these guys on the wall here right here it should be right in front yeah they're not here they've run away he's wow he's exited to the area well none of them got their loading no should we wait and see if they come back hiding put myself fire plane [Applause] he's trying to shoot the balloon oh what am i taking off oh it's glitch what the lag keep it beam the bomber oh it's going down it's down i just found someone out of

might be in the building now here thumbs away oh god jack [Laughter] this is great i love this why is no one else shot at me though i don't understand someone's running at me hang on oh okay there we go you're not as good as me get what you wish for i keep switching seats accidentally yeah i wonder if i can get that truck what do you think need help here guys yeah i'm trying you pushing me oh there's a fighter plane taking off i couldn't lucky i haven't got an angle they're all over me i'm gonna drop bombs and then jump out your teammate has failed they're set back bye there's loads of cash in there like a person i believe you want to scrap the cash and review done successful bombing run no there's someone else in the building there was someone else still in the building lackey dane had too [Music] yeah it was fine i tried to get an angle for you but there were like five people in those buildings and like i couldn't run across the road and that's cash none of this has been looted i need a restock really oh none of this believe jacqueline lovely your teammate is right so we're pretty confident by the way that that guy that was in the gas there's no way that he could have used the pds gas masks stimming to the buy station uh buying other gas marks buying munitions like he would have had to have had a durable and even then it would have been really hard you have to be sitting on a shop with unlimited money with gas masks maybe and then buying and then having stims and having unlimited ammo boxes okay was there a buy station next to him i don't think so we could look on the map further back yeah i think there was there was one there it was so maybe they weren't bitching then oh orange [Music] [Applause] get it i'm tempted take it to the end of the runway get to this fire station foundation tonight i shouldn't have missed my guns mate [Applause] i mean he's got cash for you jack he had a really bad day where's his friends lucky no yes the buy station [Music] objective is to eliminate get the bloody hell out of here you could just go through this one jack station use the plane as a guys don't you dare snipers don't you dare is i just destroyed a couple crates there yeah if you get on the bottom gunner you can see where the bombs go i need to get to a buy station is there one over here i'd say this is probably myth busted chat there's people on me they're coming over i brought an entire team i'm really sorry i'm not even kidding i brought an entire team with me let's go get that get out if you can we need to go to loadout and get sod back are you good cam kind of i i can still hear their footsteps did you sound that confident [Music] that joke is mental sorry is that the new gun yes the new lmg striker in the um in the first person camera it looks a bit like a gun from goldeneye yeah like this because you can't see the hands yeah you can't see the hands at all right okay made it all the way over thank god oh you brought the pain to me oh god was that a bomb there's double uh explosives where is there a binder there is to the left yeah let's go for that one then located actually enjoyed that bomber that was good like the controls are a lot better what our keyboard mouse yeah it does it warns you by the way when you're about to be bombed by it did you see that yeah there's a big red thing on top of the screen when we got bomb jack it literally hit the roof just above us leave the area now so it tells you when a bomb is about to hit you basically like the bf4 unlike heavy normal planes in this game which just kill you and you go oh i dropped money on the back you're kidding that's so lucky it's money how did you spend it no i didn't know you know i didn't spend it i didn't spend it that's beautiful and by or as soon as you went um can we get munitions box if you can afford it oh he's just bombing the loadout no he didn't he didn't imagine that's so that's a fact if i've ever seen one get gas masks as well if you need it yeah i bought one drop money if you've got a spare yeah three 100 that there's even loot on these buildings there that's lovely [Music] oh where is he down him nice oh bomber bomber guys we can definitely move to like here that bomber is going to go down it's smoking heavy oh behind you on the hill guys whole team contact okay gonna close the oh there's one close one close on me on me oh what the hell not a single footstep was found this day i'm not even kidding he was literally two yards from me and i couldn't hit a single foot i can't hear him see everything what happened to the bombs and everybody another one close nice job lucky nice well played the hill westy watch watch my gum my gameplay and see if you think the secure is actually better so i'm not sure nice from close range it's probably okay north west northwest guys that's where the snipe is what the hell no no no towards that jeep just for an airstrike oh my god this is insane you guys need to move back this way like that way blue marker somewhere you guys can come together and you can afford a redstone okay yeah yeah keep moving this way give me wings i didn't even see the glen dude can you get no glint on vanguard snipes yeah there's a perk that reduces its glint by like 75 percent or something oh sick i've not seen it yet really 75 oh my god yeah she's not seen in one sec if you guys pull your money there's a westy resident for you i know but we're trying to dodge the sniper right now yeah don't worry about that i think you're buying money on the bike where did you come from hold on cover and comfort that guy i need to watch my stream back and see what happened there maybe he was just here like hiding come to me boys what just happened chat tell me i've got the fat dab spot for us a fat dub spot fat dub spot okay is it i don't think this gun is supposed to be the fg-42 is it no i don't think that's a repair [Applause] [Music] how have i got 11 kills already westie you're a god i'm not recording i'm joking that's fine doesn't matter plus ratio you fell yeah i'm looking i can't see white building maybe there's a guy dropping in he's out by the by at 20 seconds and then they've got it to the left don't know if he's got himself oh whoa whoa whoa north west no window that window marked also i don't know how this guy's so close without us seeing him yet can't be that building it's gonna be something closer heading broke he's broke out the back big big big green right here and a gas mask oh we'll take the satchel one more time all right let's go jackie got the balloon there as well if we need to use it i could do it the big game rotation with the balloon we should we should take that big group um i hear chad um on the little bunkers down here not bunkers right here marker red marker yeah can we come to you yeah i've not been attacked but there is a huge fight there okay on the way not for the time no they're still flying i'm going for a little observation yeah i think you got the right idea also off the edge of the airfield as well lucky uh over here i think on one of the roofs over here yeah you've got snipers looking at me from uh from green there's seven left well we should yeah we should these are the last two team fights really yeah yeah no but green a green one of these ones teams has won then [Applause] i just broke him with the ned that one the back up on the roof we just got airstrikes right here [Applause] [Applause] now um okay that guy had another selfridge yeah they both had it i think the other team i reckon were behind us towards the green mark so they're going to be i'll check it are they ground level lucky yeah they're on their little they're in a little building oh it's one of you shootings yeah i'm just penning it nice one there [Applause] is he in there oh no i don't know where his mate is okay okay [Applause] ggs lads that was great good job good game a fun game two in a row hello fun zone oh it isn't really because there was a crash put it in it but it is but it is but it isn't i finally watched that tom scott parody nobody it's very good [Applause] i'm surprised that guy's american as well because he can do a very good english impression nobody not many americans can do a good british accent i'm just chilling there in the back yeah do you know i think that deserves guys there's that's here i like it i like on the street yeah like on this stream let's go baby well done lads swell vlade is that the new assault rifle jack yeah it is it's a new one i should put double xp on shouldn't i i've got so many tokens yeah a big fan of that new uh lmg it i think it starts right though it does look like a gun from goldeneye is that a new grip as well oh yeah i was going to find out about the grenades also guys i've not crashed so i think the driver has actually fixed it the sticky bomb no there's no sticky bomb here maybe it's just in vanguard at the moment what's up hey jack i brought my leg last week and i've been watching your videos and streams i think they've helped to keep me occupied many thanks from adelaide australia who just no problem man sad to hear about your leg though buddy i hope it uh gets better for you soon why is the sky yellow um it's because of the new gas it's a nebula five gas it's part of the storyline they've made their gas a bit more yellow rather than green greens from maui what's up tai tai hey joshua another moist victory yes indeed hey peter jackson the film director peter jackson is watching the stream guys lord of the rings wow unbelievable wow incredible wow thanks if they get this dope can we get a bunch of likes on the video that's up to the stream any plans to go back to tarkov jack you really got to put some consecutive hours in to understand the game so i do have plans to go back to talk of it's just i i feel like if i was a full-time streamer i'd play it more because like outside of content creation like i don't have much time so if i'm playing a game i have to be like recording it or streaming it because it takes up so much time to like record make videos do the commentary edit render make thumbnails etc admin work like and talk up is a big time sink so i think if i was playing it full time yes i would um i do have plans to go back and play it though i don't know when i don't want to make any promises is there any recall in the game there is ronald but it's very easy to control on mouse and keyboard so what happened with that guy in the bush then i know some people said that he wasn't there on my screen and then he just was so did he just like drop down on me what happened uh tanmay thank you for the 100 you got me into modern warfare my man thank you for that yeah i mean modern warfare as well this year like modern warfare 2 i think it's going to be massive you know they're they're really hyping it up in terms of like animation and game design they're saying it's going to be innovative we'll see there's a lot of hype for it there's a ton of nostalgia as well for modern warfare 2 so we'll see how it goes talk of players a masochist interesting opinion amy rich gaming what's up thank you joshua what's the first pc game that i played the first pc game that i ever played i was very young um i think i've told this story before but i'll tell it again um when i was like i want to say five or six um my mom and dad were still together and we all lived in the same house and they bought a um a computer called an acorn did they have those in the us or was that just the uk thing but basically the whole goal of that was to like buy educational games um like maths games and comprehension games and i did i did play those but i also played stuff like populous james pond um there was a couple of like choose your own adventure games um like the monkey island games command and conquer and then like we got a pc after that and i was playing like um wolfenstein um doom more command and conquer like red alert 2 original quake and then we upgraded again and then it was like tomb raider unreal tournament when they started doing proper 3d games you know duke nukem i mean those are some of the first games i played i was very young get to the safe zone yeah it was called acorn look it up on wikipedia i'm sure you'll find it i jumped yes but i'm gonna balloon hop to the north of docks and try and get the uh cash drop so not factory there are you guys go factory yeah there's a balloon somewhere that lucky can use yeah i can hop scotch it can you see where the balloons are there's one here i can see them visually i can see them visually i can taste them visually i don't think you went faster they're lucky by using that balloon do you yeah but i wouldn't get the height if i didn't go up them right above yourself i'm not a combat shotgun can hear someone screaming [Applause] is it one of the bots the but the what sniped me through angles they're like waiting till i run past the wall and shoot yeah they're from i mean you always get a nice kill streak from them look at that cheeky uav hello this guy up here okay i've got the nebula rounds i've got two lots of nebula rounds jack oh why is this gun where's that what the watch was it it's just an mg42 with a rapid fire build like that enemy is it really that good i mean is it insane the mp42 is good it's just so slow that nobody uses it what in terms of mobility speed or yeah just like generally people don't use them for that reason for no other dude i mean the the time to kill was nuts then absolutely insane i've got 12 grand so i've got enough okay do you want to go for the bye oh my god that's a new dp northern light custom he's got a massive smiley face on top of the drum bag right there four sets of men four sets of nebula rounds in this building i want to go up the ladder and see if that bot had a kill streak i don't need to talk about people like that gosh check out this gun just because they're not good at the game oh you have this gun the nebula boy this is a disgusting headphone a million nebulas is that um satchel oh no you got it okay um and then rouse you can get right the way up on this roof bloody hell they're right in here by the way still here oh this is cool pin down there hold on i think you should try maybe not doing that i can't see him jack i got the guy down they're up on the uh the stairs oh yeah yeah i see him now i was gonna buy us a loadout but it's landed right next to us so yeah we'll get this one is there a zippy you need help jack lastly there's three loadouts here guys it's a bit sus i have to be honest okay wesley's inside the car that's alright i'm with lucky did we get this exact loadout drop yesterday uh in the hill there's people on the hill you throwing a mini map that's beams [Applause] nobody uh guy parachuting in on big green behind you northeast no eyes he's definitely there did you kill this guy over here jack i think you'll get a kick out of this gun come here which one this one i'm holding him check that out it's got the uh the bad company it's got a big smiley face on it that's cool there westy in that building red marker on the road on the roof uh back over to the other way bro yeah he's ruined me i'm very much enjoying this new gun it's very nice i like it a lot yeah i don't think yourself for us i think he's burned kill confirmed thank you very much it was a ryan gaza right girl all right second loading okay yeah what sniper uses stud uh vanguards it's pretty nice i need to level it up yeah so i mean like it was really bad until um jack do you want a fully leveled newest rifle yeah sure let's try it out it's it's not fully level but i've done the best i can with it i will drop my lmg your lm jesus to try that one there it's got a 2.5 oh yeah [Applause] what are these guys doing how are these guys doing um babas oh they thought sorry i thought you were using the lng i like i've got a good build of this all right i'm an idiot just ignore me sniping bunker oh really yeah it's nuts isn't it cam like this gun yeah like there's no recall on it it's very a new one yeah um where do you get into how do you get into the bunker like what's going on over there [Applause] what's going on someone is sniping at me from east come into the bunker okay i won't fight these guys actually i've got i've got um money i could fight them with myself crunchy not cluster i think it should come from this machine here purple listen i'll be honest i'm coming over i'm coming over hang on i might have a team pushing me just let me know that's fine it's fine you hear that i can't hear it it's a secret message it's been decoded already though the kiki past time has already done his work yeah there's in every bunker there's one of those machines and like he's literally decoding the more geeky parts they're more like people i will say though right you remember like when we did all the most code stuff in the battlefield games yeah yeah i had to do that well it wasn't just me but the ones that i did i did manually i recorded them and then literally put them in like my editing software and like wrote it all down but in in this game if you've got subtitles on it just displays it at the bottom of the screen like it's easter eggs on easy mode um a guy just got out of the car here on the phone to activision excuse me nobody stop it nobody uh there was people all around here there was a whole team on purple roughly oh sniper looking at me [Applause] there's another player dropping in above him he's been given the absolute beaming of his existence he's dead [Applause] i put that cluster well beyond where i was supposed to that's good you're still on the roof of that sniper you think yeah it's been a bit cheeky i can't get the new music out of my head man it's so good oh god oh my god watch out watch out boom can you destroy the bomb they're there throw c4 i don't even know where he is i'm just like beaming this bomber because i want it out of the sky oh they call it a heavy rolling heavy roller isn't that just aim assist [Laughter] has its own phantom program i wouldn't mind gotta be fun that'd be fun he was peeking the bloody enemy who's peaking after all this time i've killed a man who uh selfres i didn't want any money guess mama that's just the point go back to battlefield i still don't understand why you can't buy statues in dubai but you can buy self-rises so [Applause] more money yeah they need to be super loud it needs to take longer it needs to be loud when it does it's just there's so many things more money easiest mode so double the length and then you can hear people going uh uh doing it yeah yeah that would be perfect head all right i'm going that way then i think we're definitely under the balloon i don't think you can change the length without everyone all the kill races losing their mind there jack maybe like an extra two seconds no no they would they would never they wouldn't all they would do is like that bloody jack frags he told them to concrete it by two seconds it's all his fault yeah right because that's all developers do they just listen to you they just know just you jack just me where have all the trees gone on the top of this hill sorry um it's that's you it's you it's you it's always you um yeah all the time oh the tree's not here oh no like all the tall trees for me right here are just not here have you got a helicopter helicopter no i haven't ah oh there's a guy get him westy and he drill them oh that's a big drill and he killed them yeah there's no trees here for me there's a significant amount of trees this tree's here whitelist it's the white batteries there and that tree's there so there's boys in there you're looking into the future this is an ikea now [Laughter] yes it's closing in no trees all right nobody no trees nobody no one ever cares about that do they just take it every weapon shop's not the one because it's basically just a crap loadout yeah the purple or gold well gun that you pick up is uh someone's doing a thing i'm guessing you've already met that just these pointless to have that in the game when you get your loadout so quickly yeah they should reply as well like they you know well i suppose if you're a bab who hasn't leveled up your guns yeah oh hello i kind of wish that i'd have kept my spotter on whatever it is guys if we do this we get loads of xp because it's a uh oh you're taking a beam here it's one of those top secret weapons yeah i've got like none of the chips in the truck there's one on the air gun you can't see them oh my god there he is he's coming he's coming he's coming he said i'm gonna go do this flag cap i think you thought we were babs it's still down there in the bunker guys i've got no trees uh you don't have to come over you just need to hold out you're taking [Music] i mean they're in that bunker still vehicle vehicle vehicle marked marks uh no no no no no not marx it's wait there they they go for the buy they go over the buy all the trees are not rendering [Applause] it's running [Applause] away from a flash they don't get flashed as bad do they no they're on black that's why it's not oh his body was like 600 feet in the air tightly double threat oh it's going to be around here somewhere isn't that gone okay when one of these little [Applause] oh yes this ppsh is nuts nice one jack thanks for saving my life lol still a guy with me somewhere if you want to buy some stuff oh nebula rounds let's go baby you guys guys are pushing pushing pushing close that is horrible getting hit by those that's the bounty hold on why not i'll throw the back there's three of them there's two more further back two more further back down in damage nice i'm holding the run out i've run out of bullets no do you need it he's running [Applause] i've got one of those pbs devices by the way how do i yeah i have one as well triple p triple pdfs i have a great time still 34 guys yeah there's quite a lot of men and i'm thinking we need to get a good position so maybe take this route for that big runway building oh you want to go you want to go down there yeah rather than edge of circle the roof would be disgusting someone was sniping us from that blue position okay right maybe from the hills i don't know someone said take the balloon go to green yeah yeah yeah it would be disgusting that's not in total building isn't it it's hundred percent what is somebody in the green building so no trees still no trees it's gonna get to a point where that's gonna screw you camera yeah is there a tree here who knows is there a tree there we don't know this new parachute meme is great yeah it's a it's a big gameplay change i think like just being able to find out oh god ouch that hurt he was up on the hill behind the green he's right up here somewhere no they're on there on this uh thing yeah there's a whole team i shouldn't have sat there really they're doing some weird movements that go down that guy [Music] [Applause] one more in that building up there down to one of them with nebula oh he's precision me i was just about to do the same to him and i've been absolutely slapped by top break yeah they're good players todd well those guys are there yeah i can tell they're good there's no buys left no really there's one at the end of runway you have to go all the way down there to rest with me again you've gone for far left where have they gone they're going far left or right up in the top of the one of them is in the tower but they're right some are disengaged no no you killed two of them yeah there's anything well then there's one in there let's get pushed by the zone in about 20 seconds yeah that's good cheeky res oh there's people fighting down on the beat you can't see this but there's people fighting down on the beach over here through like over there right now yeah there you go do you want to go i mean we got to go for the maya if we want cam back i mean yeah so we gotta parachute in probably hold on i'm saying if i can hold these guys down we're holding these guys out right now toddler i think it might have gone up to the right right yeah surely yeah right okay i'm going here we go oh yeah over here okay i might get shots but it'll be worth it for the labs and there's a plane here i reckon there'll be people in that building on blue to be careful there's people on the rock people on the rocks right there on blue let's go baby well done right um i just parachuted here is there people on the rocks on uh orange jack yeah yeah i don't know why they could be rotating low on the beach uh i don't feel like this is a great position anymore oh jack oh he's above you he's above you yeah he's above you on the rock okay this is gonna be the maddest stop where are they um well there's one in this building here purple yeah you just shot you from that window and there's one further back on the over there red marker um yeah uh yeah i'm just getting uh give me the money jack give me some money you've got some leftovers what did i just do okay as well what did you do you want some more jack there you go do you want to use that procedure and then i got into the night i got in the plane he took out the guy who was in the other plane and then i rode killed enough with the plane in front of me oh loki broke him there his mates on the back side of that building give me a ping give me a ping over there one up on the left on the hill careful lucky cameron there was someone in there stodd said not in here in the window there was a guy peeking the window hundred percent got off one yeah [Applause] his own okay uh no he's got two you have to move i just opened that door there yeah but there's a i still think there's people in here i think there might be people there really people of res yeah oh yeah this guy here i mean you guys have got a really bad push here so if you've got air strikes use them is there one in there no i'm checking you need the plate oh yes thank you come on that came from the window here yeah yeah it's got a shield okay i mean [Applause] you're gonna push that now he's not gonna peek again i haven't got any plates you got any spares i'm gonna position the building in front of us so that they don't peek or they're trying not to you can go beach if you want broke down now what is he invincible destructible yeah i i just shot this he's got the riot shield they've done the combat they've done the glitch they've done the glitch lackey you might have been right about the combat shield uh the combat bow and the shield glitch you i think you damaged him when you shot him yeah i hit him once wait he's just saying behind the rock he's just staying behind the rock relocating the safe zone behind us first that's the priority then if that guy's invincible agreed yeah yeah i've shot him so much right right right right down one down on the right second one uh on the left kill me i'm healing down one you got any armor um no hold on jack out there okay so could we just not hit that guy at all no no no i beamed him so you can hit them but i think the shield is like broken or something i think the shield becomes his hitbox i was like dodging the people shooting me trying to kill this guy in the gas with a oh my god that was insane dude that's mental mental match imagine this guy trying to cheat and still bottling and then coming up against us i mean have they changed how frequent combat bows are because basically that's what people are doing now i haven't seen a combat bow in vanguard royale since yesterday i haven't seen one yeah well i guess they need to just fault one of the two for the time being until they fix it he did come out of the gas though but he was in the gas for a really long time i don't know how he managed that so maybe it makes you invisible to invincible to gas but i think i think you could hit him at certain angles i don't know i like i definitely got a hit marker on him when i was beaming him that once okay yeah i was getting hit markers on him but he just wasn't taking any he didn't seem to take damage was weird yes yes what's your build for that gun cam i feel like i've got a pretty decent one but i'm just interested to the new ar the new ar recoil booster the 720 mil barrel and then i'm gonna i've now just switched to the 3.5 rifle scope i'm using 2.5 okay then the kraussnik 12v stock i was using the m1930 angled grip but i've just switched to the carver foregrip then i'm using the 60 round drum mag the last one you unlock the 30 or 6 rounds um and length and ammunition it gives you lower rate of fire but the recoil booster muzzle gives you higher rate of fire you're not running a suppressor on it then no so it's lighting up the mini-map like a christmas tree but um and then polymer grip tight grip and surplus and then once i've fully ranked it i'll put fully loaded on there yeah i just switched i'm gonna try with the recoil booster in that bigger mag this time because i was using the uh eight mil drum mode yeah the um lackey was using the sakura uh which is the 40 round mag yeah i like the secure i think it's quite good the thirty all sticks ones are they're much more heavy hitting yeah um but then they and they also reduce the rate of fire which is why i've put the recoil booster on to give me the fire you need it when you yeah otherwise it's too slow made this island gun with uh hollow point rounds poggy a little bit naughty hog a little bit naughty that yeah because if you use the m38 scope you can use the flip up optic as your primary optic which is very nice overrides the drum mag on the right side so you don't get the screen blockage very nice indeed yeah i'll have max rank this gun by the end of the at the end of the day i reckon and then i can move on to the new lmg you'll thank you for becoming a member no attack on titan bundle is that still in the store i don't watch attack on titan everyone says like i should watch it but i've just never i've never got around to watching it what's that that's the sturm giveair isn't it and you get the melee weapon and smg historia i wish you could preview the takedowns though in warzone and you can't you have to preview them in vanguard i think is that the only one maybe that is the only one is this as well this looks nuts i mean it's quite futuristic for a world war two game what's going on there it's cool though that's just red cherry red looks like lipstick or something the graveyard shift what the hell [Music] this is the valentine's day skin i mean wolf you too you barely read that because my texture detail's so low but that's what it says love you too carnation carnage i mean it's not for me why they still got the christmas things in no come on get rid of those this is captain america i can do this all day cyberpunk 1945 yeah what's the pbsh build here you go my friend the hip fire is nuts on it absolutely nuts scuba steve yeah hey joe yeah i mean a lot of the things don't work in the world two environment if they're being historically accurate right but it's a game so i care more about the fun personally what's up make how are you doing hey to ali is that three wins now i think so how we i don't know how many wins i have um records wins 465. i know someone asked that in the chat what's my kd 3.27 benny's up at the top there i know mugs has got 3.95 what's up unlucky how are you doing what's my go-to meta mike in normal vr swiss xm4 in this i'm enjoying the new lmg but i think bren mp40 the brand is still ridiculous i love that you can edit your loadouts now here it's good [Applause] incendiary's nerfed yeah it's that's not what it used to be [Applause] i suppose i could take off the pbs [Applause] it's just annoying though to be hit by it isn't it hollow point on instead maybe try that out [Applause] mr j thank you for the four months um mess is not sent please edit and try again i don't know mr j like it might be like an auto filter thing or something like what you what you trying to say graphic settings email everything's on low 1440p native vsync off and then just everything as low as it can be apart from this on high you get more fps with that and it's easier to see through particle effects and then you want the shaders on i think that's it for your team soldier the gas is closing on your position suggest you start running it's just for performance and visibility really that's it that's what i prioritize straight down factor whoops went the wrong

saying so i might as well say i thought that was a stunning nebula nebula nebularized right okay i don't like the yellow color do you think this is like the back story to the gas which will lead us to modern warfare too probably well this is world war two so we're in the prequel we're in the prequel era the lads um but yeah i reckon well what happened at the end of the modern warfare um story didn't uh price throw zakayam off the top of one of those missile silos yeah alex loses his leg because he goes and sacrifices um someone just blow up here did you guys do that i didn't do that okay

out of him all the gas is still coming out of them all you have to do is hit them once then even if you don't get down yeah it seems that way interesting but you guarantee the down with the nebula

some top pogs today so far i have to be honest it's been interesting doing my moral yeah yeah one more one more oh god i've only got 30 fps in the menu guys 30 fps i mean i'm down for another like 50 minutes or so yeah i don't mind yeah i can do another couple i mean you've pulled my um what yeah you've pulled my arm he's pulled him off how dare we allow start a short day no bastard play the game slack off come on do your job bloody y'all come on and provide the entertainment otherwise ruined got double weapon xp a little bit naughty though there's um well now i'm confused jack are you going to finish the god of war gamepl a couple years ago now i think it was like just before the world went to crap i did the whole game i live streamed the whole thing um but it was fun to play on pc you know i think we got about halfway through the game but i'm not going to finish it on pc though if you want to watch the whole thing it is actually on my channel synopsis you're making a cuppa oh i'd love a cuppa it will release a new patch yeah season two's just come out go joe it's got a lot of uh like interesting changes and additions a couple of new guns so far there is gonna be i don't know like when it's coming out but there is gonna be a armored vehicle [Applause] that's controlled by ai that like goes around the level and if you manage to destroy it you get guaranteed nebula bombs and i mean we haven't seen the nebula bombs yet so i presume that they're just not in yet but that's kind of interesting and i think as well it looks like there's some kind of a ground war game mode coming to vanguard but i haven't tried that because i don't think it's in the game yet preparation's done time to deploy to the war zone but that'll be interesting hello [Music] memory link memory you know what i think i think i'm going to do the same because my my menu is running at like 30 fps while you're restarting your games yeah i'm just going to restart the game whenever i quit my game it just crashes which is great yeah that's what i'm saying it sits in my background processes it's currently sitting there right now using eight gig of ram well i mean i mean that's a bit mental that's touch mental hang on there we go you guys see in the trailer for season two there's like some kind of like ground war mode for vanguard if there is it could be good for rabbits yeah like uh tanks and bikes in it and armored vehicles and stuff all i'm saying is then all i'm saying is since this whole microsoft stuff's gone on everything's just suddenly got better what do you reckon like when that war zone 2 thing last week when they said that the game's going to be like disruptive and innovative and it's going to be like more than just meta-changing it's not going to just be like new guns and operators what do you think they're going to do with the gameplay for warzone 2. how can they change it and innovate on it so the way i look at it right or do you want to go no no go through i was just saying like um what they'll do is they'll give you missions right maybe you have 200 players okay so there's so even if people want to extract they can but there's like a limited amount of extractions right say there's like five and you're like right grab this item from this area and then extract and then and then those people extract maximum of like five teams or something so it doesn't matter and the rest of the game goes on yeah and the rest of the game goes on and then maybe there'll be a couple more really late game if you and then that's even harder but like i feel like missions within the game almost like making like an mmo at this point do you think they'll add more ai to the levels or will that just be kind of like how it is now no i think this is the test isn't it this is like oh can we put the ai in places where they don't really attack players just randomly unless you enter that zone as long as as long as they um have a slightly more pure experience and then like i think they're already doing it like vanguard royale is their sandbox vr is their more stripped back classic experience i i've got a feeling they're talking about this sandbox mode for war zone 2 or whatever i genuinely think it will just be like a massive playground a bit like vanguard royales like we've basically been memeing all day yeah yeah it's been great and they go up and send you invites guys so if you've got this extraction mechanic stored what are you extracting what's the point let's say on the start menu um a bit like they'll say right you need to collect these items from these specific areas on the map so you go right i've got to collect this i've got to collect this one this round whatever um oh johnny what have you got oh i've got the i've got the spoon i need to collect the spoon from the shed um on the north side of the map and then i have to extract you know i mean or or extract or win so okay those things that you extract do you then use it in your loadout so it's just cosmetic stuff it could be experience boost it could be cosmetics it could be that that spoon is now your melee weapon for life like it will just be like it will just be missions within the game that kind of adds to that meta game of extraction you can join us complete this is complete guessing but you know complete guesswork i mean otherwise i would be in deep with uh some sort of india deep right yes todd you can you can join us now yeah i mean i mean that's why that's why we're thinking if someone's listening right now that is a good idea i'm just saying here we go oh god it's so hot right now a cursed skit well crampers jumpers crumpet no what is that and that's a world war ii skin that is a that is a game design degree skin for that that is something you make that is someone's final piece right there yeah this is my dissertation it's one valentine's theme for a superhero character in a world war two [Laughter] did i remember in year two like my group like we made this terrible mod for half-life 2 where like you played as like an angel and you could do like slow motion and it was basically the story to um what's that that like ancient text that you study in gcse english hieroglyphics no where like the angel falls like to to hell and it becomes a demon what's it called paradise lost it was basically paradise lost but a half-life 2 mod where you play as an angel with akimbo weapons in slow motion and you have to go and kill the devil and it was great well i mean we got a good mark for it yeah it was better than a pass yeah happy with that my team went mad and i made a statue there you go yeah that's good i made a statement did everything fall apart like it would always did it no no i i had um i had sweats okay that's good i had um coursework sweat so they did they basically carried it i made a fifteen thousand word essay that i hated i didn't know no essays what was the title essay the essay was on um using social media misinformation to destabilize nation states that sounds too serious yeah i don't i don't like that it should have just called it like using op loadouts in warzone to destroy this strategy worked for destabilizing nations you can't click the examiners you can't believe the russians did this saying that you look like uh like a deadpool outfit from world war ii i mean i was more thinking dollar store deadpool amsterdam strip at three in the morning deadpool from wish.com we are still finding a game by the way it's just what happens when somebody tells you to wear anything but clothes to a pie did you see the new filled friends i i saw the first part is it it's very yeah they've they've gone in they've gone in they did not hold back i guess it's their right well the fact that one of the players was called brutal expectations yeah i saw that oh dear people really need to think about what they tweet don't they well no it's it we're not getting into it anyway are you sure are you sure you don't want it well no it starts rinse the content and now he's gone he's quit 2042 yeah actually i never liked anyway i did actually enjoy it and i hope they can make a comeback all it needs is an entire relaunch rework and exactly yeah i mean i've got development i've given them what i think maybe would work but i don't think it's gonna happen i think they'll do that westy oh wait it says that there will be one year of support for the game in capitals at the top of every blog post and they've said that and they want to support the game for years to come i wonder if that's the case i wonder if they'll say like oh yeah because we launched the game in 2021 we started the seasons in 2022 and we're going to finish the seasons in 2023 that is years they'll finish season one and bit it off well they can't because they've sold four seasons worth of content yeah but season one is four seasons like year one year one yeah four seasons oh yeah yeah they'll do they'll do year one i wouldn't be surprised to see ea bin it off because it's well you know what do we expect sorry i think it depends on what their plans are for the future right just like i think isn't it obvious now that like a full prize battlefield game in this like ecosystem doesn't really work like when you've got free games like warzone apex fortnite i just want time for three they are working on titanfall stuff it's just gonna be a long way out all right like well and they're doing this they're doing three other games they're doing the star wars fps a star wars rts and a jedi fallen order too right so respawn they're like stocked up at the moment my only problem with all of that is that that's what they did for dice and then they overloaded them and then look what happened take a look at what happened i just hope that doesn't happen to respawn [Applause] resort pixel though respawn independent though aren't they like they're owned by ea but they're an independent studio yeah just publish yeah i think so i'm pretty sure yeah just do the publishing i might be wrong on that but i think that's right i don't think they've bought our respawn now you're right also zampella has so much like power and sway in the industry especially after apex legends like how successful that's been well he was he was cod four wasn't he and medal of honor yeah wait vin sampela was also behind apex as well yeah yeah it's responsibilities full full meta like ea probably just go do whatever you want it's fine how much money yeah sure kendra wilson's like yeah go on then all right i'll open the checkbook other people land here yes or maybe one start least he what's up bernie how you doing hello reign tim davis chris good news jack calculating your wins and monthly income you get 950 000 per win okay well i've just

that'd be great is the keeper carbine close medium long what is it well he beamed me from 150 meters away with no recoil so it's quite beamy south frieze hello there where i am angel from my nightmare it's a pan it's a pen i've still got 11 grand that's good um should i get a lowly oh god yeah speak oddly speedgoed get you ghosties oh yeah baby i can't wait wow we play vanguard royale like athletes let's do it warzone athletes yeah let me show you how to be a war zone athlete you're not wearing the right skin laggy oh yeah no you've got doing some kind of  outfit surely start i remember your video back in the day how tv players play warzone this actually reduces wind resistance you get 0.1 meters per second faster what headphones are you sennheiser 363ds valentin i've had them for years and they've never broken never let me down i think i've had them for like three years honestly really good probably better options available now but for me they work great yeah i know the odds yeah no you just landed on an airstrike three of them uh i didn't realize they were right there you're all dead okay [Music] [Music] well i guess we're ruined i mean get to the safe zone now scavenge your contract did you just land on a team like what happened yeah we just literally landed on a team we didn't even know they were there [Music] is it inspired to inspect i can't remember yeah uh eye to inspect only some of the guns have got inspect animations uh the two new ones do but the rest of the vanguard guns don't oh and i think that's because they haven't pointed them over from vanguard yet interesting some of the morse code translations contain a reference to a battleship 22 miles off the coast of caldera yeah north coast there's nothing there though uh new rebound not yet yeah maybe a big maybe a big ship new rebirth aircraft carrier well they're they are doing a new rebirth aren't they yeah well no no they're reworking rebirth it just looks a bit different um i think there's a crate in here two crates because there's been a restock so see it's slowed down it's slowed all the way down should i go for that jack yeah i mean i've not been over there so it's fine as long as it makes it easier for you to get the cash fighting's over around don't see any sandals no sagittal down your money in here jesus christ i don't know if there was someone near me you're right yep there they come here they come right if they were coming from your north west your west here can i get that buying time they're on they're on they're on a loadout right now i wouldn't no you're not gonna get there nearest one down at sub pen what about this one down here in front of me uh you might be able to get to that one yeah for this one go for the sub i might go for the sub pen one because i don't think i can get to you without being killed got no guns but i have a great time i think you're good jack i might find a little bit of cash and be able to get you or get someone both sick men are back in town the men are back in town getting across there but it'll be worth it you're gonna be later remember that up up the hill up the hill those people yeah marks right there down one who's that and that guy i just love his gear not smart there's two guys on my left i don't know one of them's on the red markers one of them's on red marker uh jack you've got a full team running in over here enemy precision airstrike this is your strike this is going to kill me isn't it i've got enough to raise in a second they're ready they were up here remember should i just kill myself yeah i think so look up to me there's a guy just come out the gas on me on the red marker green buy a sale we get running around good luck there's nowhere to go we're like there's like two of them there's two of them on that shelf i've just been killed by some other teams oh my god it's pain it's pain it's pain people have hit up this by already wow that's pt beam no it's on you come oh of course it's the same team that killed us at the beginning oh i hate this game sometimes if you stay in the same area for that long i think the game should just start dealing damage against you [Laughter] you need to move you need to move so they remove now move now they've announced the pc requirements for elden ring oh yeah recommended specs i7 8700k or better 1070 or better that's high floor elven ring is that pretty high either i mean not really fine will it run at all jen minimum specs are an i5 8 400 or a 10 and a 1060. yeah but is it is it running on old gen though or is it only new yet i don't actually know it's it's a little pc melty that's that's the way to look at it it's vital for the uh for this new assault rifle is that yeah it's the last perk you unlock but you massively sacrifice recoil and accuracy for it interesting one level seven zero unfortunate that was guys um they just full sent onto the the building and there was a squad there and that just left me on my own and then i had to play catch up try and get the rez's those two squads though they knew i was there they were hunting me and they played well one put an airstrike on me the others just held me i think i was screwed either way though what's up tony do i like frasier i've never seen like that many episodes of frasier girly i've watched it in the past what monitor do i have search in hb omen x 27 hertz 40p what's up johnny how you doing imagine being able to buy a new gpu the best way to get a new gpu is buy a pre-built [Applause] if you actually want one [Applause] obviously that's going to cost a lot but you know if you're really desperate that's probably a way to guarantee getting one hopefully the situation changes soon and they start you know having good availability on gpus again but i know that um a lot of the oems a lot of the system builders have been prioritized so they're being sent the gpus so when people actually buy them they're going to gamers rather than people who are just mining crypto someone who works uh hardware company he's like hey we've got some stuff coming in um jack has gone early oh that was an accident sorry i didn't mean some pings are broken at the moment is that where we're going yeah we're going to the sound oh it's because i think i think i pinged the balloon by accident okay there are so many men going for that that i am going to run away from it a good tragedy oh is it messy what's up hey tony how are you doing man i didn't realize it was you sorry i hope you are that's how you got yours and saying yeah become the i.t guy interesting good tactic [Applause] the i shall whittle my way to victory enemy bomb above you leave the area now hold on i can't wait to get killed what are you doing in there buddy [Applause] [Music] there's a red skin a bright red skin [Applause] he's yeah he's not happy we killed him if he peeks you in the window again i can try and beat him cheeky peeky and he's flashed himself oh no and we've simply failed to kill them where's he gone i think they jumped out yeah he must have done because they were mental shots over here should we go down to the earth not another one another one there's a man here if you've got a sniper [Applause] that music is really stuck in your head it's really good dude it's my favorite like that one season four is the best music right by far season four for modern world warfare yeah i still like season two when they introduce ghost that might be my favorite dun dun dun dun dun there's a car there's a car he's driving he's gotten out here need a westy could you drop me so i can just play no no which doesn't seem to be working very well oh you're just like here [Applause] yeah he can bomb the loadout he's not strong oh that is that is gone that is gone they got the wrong the wrong bomber the bomber has to be leveled out for him to drop drop bombs so if he kills it like that he won't be able to drop it really so he can i'm pretty sure you told us that yesterday we just didn't listen do we ever listen no no evans what's up aj hi from south africa you've been streaming a lot more lately any reason or just enjoying the interactions it's just different you know it's a bit more chill um different type of content creation um also like a lot of my streams are sponsored um like a lot of the uh you know publishers and game marketing is switching to live streaming rather than video so that's you know another reason as well uh but yeah stream is really fun i enjoy it and you know it can be a vod afterwards a video afterwards that people can watch and it's just cool to interact with you guys live you know like i think sometimes when you write a comment in a video you might feel like oh they're never going to see my comment they're never going to reply to me but live you know hopefully i've shown you guys that i actually do um yeah it's good fun as well you know there's no hiding anything it's all raw unfiltered gameplay banter whatever you want it's long form obviously i know it's not to everyone's taste there's a lot of my audience come for those like hyper edited videos don't they but yeah it's good fun it means that i can relax a bit as well lovely lovely blue marker blue what are you doing in the bottom do i want jack oh there we go he's running across the eggplant on the open side i hit him because i'm nuts can there be more than one bomber at once right yeah there's up to three oh yeah yeah i love this a little bit well that second one's closed oh yeah there was another one there there's like four men like a red marker at least my i don't know if you hit the one close on the tents or the one further i have no idea nice love this love this i hear him stay throwing a flashbang [Applause] that's right you've got um you've got a team over here on this buy station nissan plates on green uh kind of on green you've got a team coming your way up guy on the edge of the building there like uh cameron [Applause] oh the bomb just dropped those bombs on green essential i don't see him they're going green someone just sniped at me yeah i've seen him peek again behind me on me unfortunate for that guy there's two guys behind us watch out for further back on that near to the right of that red marker oh no what what there's another guy in there let's do like fire damage of course yeah yeah yeah he's low he's really low i can't hold on lucky we might need your help i'm honorable drop don't decide for someone else laggy drop them all over the men i mean if you got those kills then dude i don't know the the guy that was low was the other there was two of them yeah there was an another dude that pushed you so sorry i didn't realize good i dare you i'm back in familiar territory the kulak  him you're the ghouler right i'll let you know if i see him survive to earn redeployment he's middle middle campaign [Applause] ready up your teammate has failed they're sent back to base we're here and you return to the battlefield i'm grabbing this no way what nice jack i nearly dropped a bomb on a fighter that was taking off oh that would have been sick cameron i can get this one jack and then it will ping somewhere else well they they were over on the that side right yes they were identified get that one as well cam and i'll get the next not the bomb coming [Applause] i hate this game so much you got killed by the fire claim the glory [Applause] i can't believe that just happened to me all right can we go back and get our gear i don't know i mean that team were pretty good they were over there yeah they're over here yeah maybe we oh jack we've got enough cash if we go to a buy we can just get another load up all right we need uh study them as well looks to be baby started oh yeah [Applause] [Music] it i mean we do have nearly enough if we get the lack of them here i've got enough i'm going to can you try and land the bomber on the road yes i can't can you land on the road of this road right next to us it's wide enough yeah i think you'd be all right landing it here don't worry about the don't worry about the palm trees or anything you don't worry about those thunderbirds they'll go backwards right this is not going to go well all right i'll give it i'll give it a while you need to level up yeah that's it for the content come around on the left it's a long road to be fair there you go you're going to hit a tree with the wings though that's what i'm saying it's going to be like thunderbird 2 where the trees are just going to flop down either side here he comes and there's oh god oh god here comes the boy i mean that's the point oh come on come on you could have [Laughter] well it's sort of a landing i suppose it's kind of a landing i mean at least he's technically landed it i mean if it wasn't for that one pump if it wasn't for the palm tree in my left that would have been fine once he's raised get in this vehicle we all run back yeah and then we're in the winchester guys there's money here i think we can get low as if to not imply that every country would instantly i'm sorry to have misled you careful okay oh what okay you're an idiot i'll be back that's the guy that killed me i think yeah did he think i've got no idea [Laughter] like he's like i've had enough of this i'm getting in the bummer you've just gone straight back for it he wants to be out here yeah this is the team that killed us this guy broke he's broke down he's broke dead he's dead it's the big daddy hang on we played against these last match um some stream tickling maybe occurring here they came straight i don't know all right guys villa lucky don't do it you just took it and died okay my intention is to be a high altitude bomber high altitude night bomber i don't know if he's still alive jack he's dead you got him with a cluster i think he's got dark out me some enemies what are you doing over there i i was going for the uh money drop but i was down here uh further that way jack someone just said oh god lucky don't put don't bomb me that's fine i didn't bomb you i'm purple jack [Applause] you want a bomb up here on on light blue that's where you want to be bombing i just got shot out with nebula rounds a light blue bombing can we can we please witness this god dirty sweat who wants me dead light blue yeah i i believe there were i believe there are men there nearly no well the one that i downed yeah but this guy no he just fired a shot up here look he's different it's got to be different should we go uphill again yeah yeah destroy the vehicle but other than that no here maybe down here lucky there are people on the barn building yeah down there on light blue should be up here isn't he uh he was on orange i think stud yeah yeah there's still no not there but kind of there an enemy team that's gotta be down surely that's further than that i think he's down over there mega fuming he's down there gas is closing the mega few finish that one there's another one look lucky spiderm throat eyes down can't hit a damn thing with this whitley you're gonna need sniper on my jack yeah yeah there you go right so you can bomb your own plane you can but you get too close um i dropped the bomb and then i immediately bailed out and tilted downward it instantly took me out right baby foggy i control oh no no no there's another other guy over here somewhere oh my reds no no no i have no idea where that's from it was north west almost direct yeah i still want to see them right lucky i'm gonna have to do the quickest loop all the way around for this bro hold down that one i'm dropping here there you go what men men here yeah there were people on that hill one guy on red marker as well i'm gonna push around here you stay there i'll get another angle here i think he's got self rest because he's uh his mate's not going i don't know my little sound i died how i died now one's pushing around left he's got to be he's gonna be flanking us yeah he is look super far left behind me jack mark last guy there's two there they're gonna shoot me in the back in a second hold on i'm stuck not if i've got anything to say about it let me know if you kill them and i'll sweep their gear broke down now one more yeah he was in the same area god we're absolutely bullying these dudes stud oh you know they were gonna they were trying to flank us really wide watch yeah yeah i'm

the gas people over the building start oh this is not good i've got my weapons yeah i'm gonna push i'm gonna keep going all right so keep pushing right stay peeking now i knew the gas mask was a good idea i'm kind of ruined now i think unless we get it down hold on hold on airs right on the building should push them away from the windows just for a second moving i'm moving thank you cam careful careful all right someone before lucky there's a guy on the left this guy on the left of the hill over here three plates that's all i've got yeah i'll drop one for lucky there you go lucky oh they're just coming off the building now whoa let's keep moving keep moving keep moving let's keep moving because there's so many times [Applause] these are the same team i guess so yeah they're just gonna push you on double rest oh he's got [Applause] i think they would have pushed into the farmland they've already pushed in they pushed into lucky uh wesley sorry yeah yeah they definitely pushed me gas is coming it's fine i've somehow managed to make it away well played lovely we should not we should not buy this no we can't just just stay in as they've seen this we need to oh god there's nowhere to run i can get down maybe i definitely think there's some stream tickling happening here i don't know about you red red marker red marker road marker because they seem to know exactly where we are the same squad just keep jumping on us there's no uavs so okay air strike there on your left come yeah [Music] see ya and there's a man right behind me no footsteps i think i got the guy that shot you but you have to keep pushing back you got a big cover there cam he's above me we are being pushed by these guys keep pushing back oh yeah contact here once a behind the spine is lucky looking red marker you're all loaded up what what how oh it's because i've got the bloody white outfit on that's why you may have had high alert as well uh yeah yeah they've got high alert they've got high alert is this the same team that keep killing us yeah yeah yeah oh great i mean that's wonderful it's beautiful it's wonderful it's lovely though i think that might be it for today guys what do you reckon yeah i

one good boy goodbye have a good day catch you all tomorrow bye [Music] stream thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this today we were using the new assault rifle i've nearly maxed that out actually they've really increased the xp which i'm glad about but that's the build i was using pretty happy with that oh actually i could probably put hand stuff on it now that might work out better and that was the ppsh build we may be back tomorrow for some more i'd like to try iron trials though on rebirth i think is it out yet caldera clash it's not that is it large-scale team death match yeah i know some people were like oh that's the ground war mode it's not i don't think that's the mode with the tanks i think the mode with the tanks is in vanguard and iron trials isn't out yet for rebirth which is a shame i thought it would be like a lot of stuff is mid-season by the looks of it but yeah i enjoyed it today it was good fun i hope you guys enjoyed watching if you did leave a like thank you appreciate all you guys being here and as always once again a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one season two is live now that's what we've been playing today and yesterday and for war zone there's a ton of changes i'm sure you saw a lot of them today the bomber balance changes the yellow gas bullets the nebula five the chemical factory the research labs we did go into a bunker a couple times maybe rebirth is just iron trials by default does anyone know i don't know i don't feel like it is because it would say iron charles here wouldn't it not sure yeah good
