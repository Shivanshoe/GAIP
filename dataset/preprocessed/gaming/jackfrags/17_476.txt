what you're about to witness is the full power of the dmr 14. and there it is fair and balanced now i never thought that i'd see the day that i'm using a dmr as my main primary weapon in warzone if you'd have told me that back in march when the game came out i'd laughed at you i said nah no way and yet here we are this thing has just been added to the game with the cold war weapons and it is absolutely nuts one prime example here someone camping in a helicopter let's see what happens what's that guy doing in that helicopter oh he's just gonna meet him around in the air and get uh parachute kills oh i see right just yeah plus he's a mobile spawn point for all of his friends because he never dies ah that's genius if we shoot him i'll die yeah go on down goodbye you're joking that's the dmr long range sometimes you don't even need to aim oh you can be bad like i am just shoot as many bullets as you want eventually the target will go down not much recall on it end of the game put yourself a precision air strike down take one of the players out push up close range you can spam it get the headshot switch to mark 10 get the finish win the game for your team easy peasy now in terms of your loadout hit up the dmr14 you can level this up in cold war or you can do it in plunder i just mostly did it in plunder it was pretty simple on the muzzle agency silencer and then for the barrel you want the titanium barrel that's the one to go for apparently although the match grade does say it gives you those things apparently it doesn't really and there's a guy called jay god who i watched on youtube who said the titanium was the best to go for optic it's subjective but i like two times or three times or you can go with a short one if you want field agent full grip for the underbarrel and then as for the mag i've just got the standard 30 round mag although i do think you level up to a 40 round fast mag there which could be a good option but i'm just happy with the 30 round mag so that's the kind of build that we're looking at go with that and you won't put a foot wrong i kind of get the feeling that there's something broken with this gun though because sometimes it just appears to do excessive amounts of damage although you can actually two shot someone if you hit them twice in the head with this there are other guns in the game that will do that but this is so good because it's got incredibly low recoil and you get so many bullets in the map that it's just an absolute beast right now so level it up use that kind of build go have some fun with this it's a really good choice right now and before we get into a match where this was just dominating for me as always a huge thank you to all you guys using my creator code in the cod store i've had so many of you tweet me pictures i am keeping track of them all and saving them all these legends here they just added a load of new bundles to the store as well so if you use my code jack frozen or caps that's just a nice way to support me with that said here's the game for you now with myself study tomographic and the tactical brits i hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like and now it's time to jump in let's take a look at how devastating the dmr 14 can be you're gonna dig this hit once jack's got a sensex that just keeps on giving oh god i got another screamer [Applause] i can hear someone in the stairs [Applause] [Music] okay armor down lovely there you go i mean it just chunks so hard target areas marked center let's throw on them just in case this is loaded 2-0 good copy it's just oh excessive god he was not happy with that fire station oh no one towards it recklessly and down on the vehicle ow i think he's got a dmr as well yeah he does he knows the way the pig soldier goes up they're always right in the corner they rest back there they're moving you got here max 10 time right here bro that's quite cheeky there jack good uav though people everywhere surrounding us storage oh man it destroys confirming the kill [Applause] [Music] i say we head west guys we need to get closer to storage there's a guy here he used to be lit all right i didn't stand a chance i'm going to zone these guys so hard come on zone him and bone yeah way up there i'm not even aiming this thing anymore i'm just pressing mouse one that's all you need to do broke again getting tags silly go at the end of storage i would get out of storage down because it's the matty central surely just stay arranged oh crap he has it too he definitely has it too fine i believe you can live i believe you can live i believe nothing will hit you and you'll be fine [Applause] see wow no no no snail speed though [Applause] [Applause] he's got he's got a plate box god damn it it's all right god damn it moving position too close just saw him on the mini map so he's going to be coming in here [Applause] nice this is the spot oh there is there below there uh last theme lasting it's the squad last team [Applause] round one pushing this guy oh dummy are the bins i need to get a pic really use this rock here maybe where did you come from you guys have zone i've got a hill holy crap that thing is ridiculous i think he's insane how did you get lucky you've got 18 2 you got 18 kills as well good lord dmr squad you
