can you guess what happens next [Music] well it's not that difficult to work out but it's pretty disgusting either way a couple days ago they added buyback quads into warzone i'm not sure if i've played this one before i played it in solos joes and trios but i don't remember if they've ever done it in quads but gets absolutely mental at times can be really fun though but there are just so many cheaters in the game right now we gotta go with our cheetahs though here hey it was great and i was using the car 98 to full effect and if my memory serves me correctly every kill that i got with the car 98 was a head shot just because it's so easy to hit heads with this thing the bullet speed the rate of fire the follow up shots that you can get it's a beast the hdr is my boy but the car 98 i think maybe it's encroaching on that territory now i do enjoy it more than the spr as well although the spr is still great but the car 98 man baby do you think that a gun from world war ii is popping skulls in 2021 in a call of duty game madness so today playing with study westy and tactical brits having some good times some good memes a bit of fun really great game this was and i think you guys
