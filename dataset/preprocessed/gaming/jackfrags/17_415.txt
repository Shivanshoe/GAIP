today is one of the most fortuitous days for i have found a server running rush on battlefield 4 on the nighttime version of zavod the graveyard shift and i couldn't resist i had to give it a shot i'm using the m416 here i've gone suppressed as well suppressors in bf4 they can't know if you're damaging your range a little bit but they do keep you off the minimap which is really important in this game and that thing can also put me on the minimap and we've already lost the first base okay luckily for me because this is bf4 rush this is one of my favorite things to do you just rat at the back while all the attackers go past you but you only get a limited time to do this we're not dead try nade because eventually they will see you on the killcam and they will just find out where you are what's going on you kidding me [Laughter] oh my god the shotgun to the face this guy's still in quite a forward position though this cheeky little triple kill there on the m416 so good just trying to tap fire oh there's about there can't slide in this game now it's got dmr or something damn it oh no i've got flanks killed by a 460. look at that squad there i think they were getting sick of me real jack law nope fake oh we're on the roof just shooting at doritos at this point very different vibe to the standard version of this map though you can actually use uh irv scopes and they work all right here nope leave it hello bouncing around everywhere yes the 416 one of my favorites in bf4 very versatile assault rifle i think i've got the stubby grip on it as well this jack from youtube can you get in here you can cut you can squeeze in there somehow see if i can get back there universe [Music] looks like it's getting a bit busy indoors here oh that shadow then oh god he was like oh they just keep running in no this shotgun guy again he's at the top that's where i wanted to be that dude's got me unlocked still got friendlies on the roof though are they on both objectives [Applause] i'm sure that i can like squeeze in here somewhere is it here yeah there's a guy there i'm batman now oh you rest that was a mistake yes love this oh it bounced right i've definitely been spotted on a kill cam now so i'm probably dead next time they run in here we'll see hey it's really difficult to shoot down in video games you know what it is something uh seems to get messed up with the head wrench what was i just saying no okay right screw it come on secondary yes of course i've got the magnum what did this guy have i can't see the gun oh it's 4 16. it's loud though green laser oh god you coming no oh left side there's more look how cool that laser looks dude didn't have a child oh god this is it man this is why i love rushing this game you can just run around at the back and bleed the tickets although they have set the charge right around a bit too much maybe i was thinking earlier i can't wait like if the next battlefield game has loadouts and stuff that actually have decent weapon customization you know like modern warfare warzone style ah that'd be sick because we've not oh my this dude again we've not really had that i've got rest style already we've not really had that in a battlefield game for ages since bf4 really you know we've had uh hardline one and five hardline had uh the gunsmithing or whatever it was called the gun bench but came a bit too late didn't it but i'd love to see some proper in-depth weapon customization in the next game so i could do like loadout videos and like what what are the best attachments you know like i do for the war zone and stuff that'd be super cool [Applause] this battlefield games tend to have really interesting weapon mechanics is there another one there no i'm clear okay get wrecked no that's the body rag don't put me off yeah it does feel like a night time like this doesn't it i think they did a pretty good job with it had a really sick easter egg on it as well on the roof here and at the back [Applause] now the easter egg was like a stone that was uh repeating i've got little birdie legs you know from neebs gaming so battlefield friends it was that backwards and really slowly and then it led to something else i can't remember what it was it was some kind of unlock or it was a cool easter egg i remember it it took a while to work everything out there i think die soleil did it dice la made the night version of this map i might just right here for a bit [Applause] oh god just got wrecked trying to be stealthy all right mate nope right i'm going back oh he got me i think we're gonna win this one i can't believe i actually managed to find a server that was uh running this though see if i can get kill with that nade it just killed me that is a really old bug that they said they fixed i've not seen that for years it's where the grenade goes away from you and it looks like it's away from you but the server actually puts it in front of you i think what happened was it bounced off my teammate or something or the real the real damage grenade bounced off my teammate digit and uh and killed me well i thought they fixed that bug that's like seven years old or something anyways that was fun very lucky to find that map and uh game mode combination because people don't really play anymore oh there it is bf4 night maps they did do a siege shanghai one as well but that was just in the city it was a test and they never they never released it anyway guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next
