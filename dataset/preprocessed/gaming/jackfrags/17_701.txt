announcement yesterday I mean that's a good start but I got you CAD guys come on who just who does that people still people still you calving 2020 oh man but anyways I can't believe that what they're so rude a bit of beer for today and I thought you know what I'm gonna play a lot of beer for I really am I reckon there's gonna be a lot more beer for on the channel obviously I'll cover the f5 like when the new map comes out and if there are any new guns or any additions in the summer update but I reckon there's gonna be a lot more before and ba3 on the channel again you share not me then it was you maybe even since pod up you know maybe we can get the guys back together do a bit of squad er maybe I could play with other people it's quite a not be quite cornet but just make it like a regular thing again now I do enjoy playing via four and I know that a lot of you guys or you tell me in the comments and there's always a lot of likes on those videos so you know it's more beer for that's what we're doing live gameplay stuff like this playing with friends that kind of thing having a good time and the girl who's in here today is the mp7 and to be honest with you I don't know how good it's gonna be because it's a bit of a longer range map but you know I used the topic that up I used the mp7 all the time in warzone and I loved it there but in bf4 I never you kidding me I've got to reload I never really use it that much it's like I think I've only just unlocked one suppress one where did that bullet go my go crazy here you'll go for a knife I hear I know your game Ruud van salty with the yuca not again attack boats are so scary usually the people who still play attack boats are the guys that just played all the time you know and those people who would just insanely good at them can kill infantry here I'm the mp7 kill this guy before he kills me well yeah but there's a shock and right behind me I didn't matter anyway well I'm getting on this hovercraft and we're gonna go take G this still it falls out in the middle of nowhere it has a helicopter on it gone go for the heli I wanted you to go for the heli damn it I wanted to shoot you down oh I'm gonna rock it out I like this map though it's good fun oh just sum up the ACOG yeah hipfire on this is nice and we get like a laser sight on it or something not much damage of that distance though oh nice little headshot
