yeah i got to go to the premiere of that oh baby i got to meet sonic himself was he in a suit or was he just a cgi monstrosity on the screen he wasn't a suit but the guy who voiced him but he was just in like a regular suit like a nice suit but if i played a character like that in a movie i would definitely go to a dress as that character oh wait are you saying you met the voice actor yeah oh i see i thought you were saying you just met a guy who was dressed up in a sonic costume or something i mean there was one of those as well let's go oh now this it doesn't have it doesn't have the gun on it sean we don't need a gun where we're going oh  it looks like we've instantly died they're falling down the chasm yeah i don't think we'll need a gun anymore we're dead whoops oh well at least we're on the scoreboard well it says minus 100 yeah yeah i've never had that happen yeah it was catchphrase catchphrase mr chips yeah say what you see what the dog doing i don't know if i'm saying that you better love it if you don't love it then okay well it's not ever smeggy the g is gonna have words to say about it do you know what i mean though smegy like out of every name you could pick you go with smega right next to the neurafin you can definitely tell we're playing on british servers why is neuropen on the server i'm here to kill some pain i died buprofin okay i've got the sniper i as the one capturing his own with me where's our team there's so many people here sean oh get ready yeah this map's stick you're right this is the best map yes great it feels classic halo yeah how what no it's all the emotions of halo there rolled into a few seconds no what no couldn't be what i want to be up there with smeggy the g man you can't he's he's just too good what the hell okay i've got a uh i've got a machine gun this is how we went sean love it love it there he goes he's snaggy thai g is there a smoky video and smeggy the g oh no it's making thai g i read it wrong i thought they'd have evolved or something there was two of them halo combat involved it's just duplicating smacking stay away halo's all about the power weapons isn't it really yeah once you get that rocket launcher you get that sniper and get that machine gun that's when the fun begins so you get your multi kills oh god i'm right behind you look sean let's go let's go got a shield down at the door i'm almost dead i'm dead i had a shotgun and i missed not like this i don't like this not like this surprising in battlefield 3's campaign sorry was it like three two one suppressor yeah in the uh the first mission well the second i guess when you find the rocket launcher oh that's it yeah there's a slow motion what's this man throwing at me that man just threw an explosive box at me sean it's quite rude oh yeah they're on top of our base you can get them yourself if you want okay on top of the base yeah i have one in my hand right now where about they're like little white containers oh there we go i've got one so you just throw them at people yeah i've gone across that like blue beam bridge and then what hit someone like across the map before and it was the most satisfying thing ever they respawn yep no i've never got a kill with a hammer i don't think i ever will either yeah it's hard i don't believe it yeah instantly killed oh is this a mistake i always do it i pick up the hammer this is the one this is the time instantly done ruined tobleroney tony that's a good name some good names in this level you trashed out yep i like it shooting me in the back makes me a better player oh no they killed neurofen oh no he's gonna need some european how am i gonna treat my headaches dynamo grenades are quiet dynamo grenades acquired he is the same blow yeah right in this thing huh if i go forward and then you grapple as i go by ready yeah go wee let's try again i want my montage you know i want to snipe like four dudes in a row kill them all it's just not happening that's the intro to the video isn't it yeah and it's all downhill from there i have to rely on my comedic talents after that there's nothing else on that clip what is hitting me man scorpion tank hello i like that where though we'll have to wait and see oh yes get in can you see it oh it's over here outside baby ewok is right next to it oh there's another one then it's landing on top of me here somebody yeah somebody else got one the other side oh i skewered someone no scope across the map across the map he's won oh i took out that brush time did you get the tank yeah i took out that tank oh yeah the tanks just they're not very tanky they don't really reverse either should just be pushing forward no fear imagine that my team kill i don't think he can kill but you can definitely damage i think he can just take shields from teammates damn this is actually so satisfying yeah it's super fun do we only score if we have all of them i think so yeah i'm just gonna go put it on b and see what happens yeah we need b well there's a tank on it now sean incredible performances well they're all on c for some reason oh no they're as dying capturing your top of the round now 20 kills okay i'm gonna get hijacked i think oh get off me he started hijacking me and i just shot a tree near behind it got him this is incredible sure this is the best game ever now you're you're ruining everybody's days this is the best game ever i got a kilimanjaro apparently you see that you got a whole mountain kilimanjaro oh and that helped us get all the points scored baby that tank was incredibly useful yeah that was unreal you'll never have the likes of it ever again no we're gonna get put in the uh sweaty lobbies now sorry how's it wasper sean why am i just being given all the vehicles i don't understand right where you need to be every time how do i shoot rockets from this though i don't know yeah i don't know i thought it would be right click or something i kind of feel like i need those luckily for me the gun fighting isn't very good so i think i should beat him with the guns i went straight to the bottom of this scoreboard i need to open my game okay i'm flying in the wasp now ah see that thing flies how do i do the rocket shaun i want to know maybe you're a grenade button oh no [Music] how do we lose this match i don't know they had captain america steve rogers every time makes sense that's a good round though yeah you were right man that map is awesome yeah there's a good pace to it i think a lot of places to hide it feels very battlefield eh yeah it's like it's the caspian border of halo you
