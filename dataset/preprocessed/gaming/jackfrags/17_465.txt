think about this for a second battle royale with wizards instead of an m16 you've got lightning bolts and magic missiles that's what spell break is and a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video i've been playing it the last couple of days getting used to it as there's surprisingly a lot of depth to the combat and traits that you can choose and there's a lot of fps skills here required as you've got to aim the abilities yourself and move around float fly all that stuff it actually reminds me of tribes or unreal tournaments at times so i'm not sure if any of you guys watching remember those games but they were a really big part of my gaming sessions as a kid so today i've got some highlights of a match that we played with bongi from the two angry gamers and of course part welsh we're all still pretty new to the game learning as we go but we had a good time here and if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below the game is free to play on pc xbox playstation and switch full cross play and progression and they just released their first chapter with the new battle pass i hope you guys enjoyed this if you do leave a like and a comment below that really helps me out thank you let's get it so this is the loot that you find in the game right you've got boots yeah which give you movement speed you've got belts which give you armor and you've got amulets which increase your mana so you can do more spells right so that's pretty straightforward yeah then over here this is your shift ability in the middle yeah so you've got stuff like dashing you've got teleportation you've got wall hack and you've got fly fly is clearly the best oh yeah uh and then sorry i'm just frozen and then over here you see how you've got your left ability which is the one that you've picked yeah you can also equip a different gauntlet when you're in the match based on what you find and that goes on your right oh i see right
