something big is about to go down in the dansk look at this the game updated couple days ago and now there is a lightning storm in the sky and a giant cargo ship and if we look on the side of it it says vodyanoy now if you remember the trailer from a couple days ago for season two it showed this ship coming towards the land and some players have received mysterious radio messages where the screen goes like all staticky and blurry for a second and then you can hear a russian transmission come in and it's from the captain of that ship i've got this clip here that someone posted on twitter a guy called ct420691 i'll just quickly play it for you now so that's the captain on that ship over there and he says hi this is the captain there is a biological danger on board it was being held in a container and now we're all in danger i've never seen anything like this please help us and then there's some screams so what does it mean something is about to go down in the damsk and the season starts on the 24th of the 25th so only a few days to wait really but whatever's in that it will have massive consequences for the game i just love how cool it looks man like that thunderstorm is awesome it keeps getting closer and closer as well it wasn't that close when i came and looked yesterday you can't really see anyone moving on it or anything like that and what do you guys think is on there some people have speculated that it could be zombies with how hard cold war has been pushing the zombie stuff in that new outbreak mode biological danger that sounds a bit zombies too but they do keep talking about the beginning of the end in their trailers so this could be the catalyst that makes a new map for warzone how cool would that be i know there's some rumors that there's a new map coming on the anniversary which is in march so it could be then we just don't know but i think it's awesome that they're doing this uh story building like this it's getting closer and closer every day let me know what you think down in the comments below what do you think is going to happen here i reckon there'll be a cinematic maybe next week where that thing crashes into the ground over by what does it look like it looks like it's aimed at prison doesn't it if you look at the trajectory of it and in the trailer looks like it's heavy right for prison so it could be a live event where it crashes into the shore breaks the prison down or maybe just a cinematic and update and then boom the map has changed i don't know if they can do live events on this engine like fortnite can but fingers crossed man that'd be awesome for all the player base to be involved at once but imagine if it's zombies on that or something worse what could it be i don't know let me know down in the comments below what you think anyway moving on i wanted to show you some highlights of a duo's match that i played with my friend andy i was using the ffar and the dmr kind of wanted to see if the dmr was still any good you can still spam it really fast like that the damage is definitely taking a drop off medium range though awesome gun still it's just you have to work a bit harder for those shots but the ffar is insane maybe it's a bit too good at the moment i foresee some kind of nerf in their near future i don't know if that'll be coming with the patch next week when they change them up or whatever put those new points of interest in that they mentioned it's just so effective at lots of different things even at longer ranges if you can control that recoil it will outshoot most guns in the game even the guns that are supposed to be good at longer distances like the scar and the a max that kind of thing and at close range if you put the i think it's the raider stock or the sas stock i'm using the raider at the moment you just get supreme movement speed while you're aiming so you've got excellent recoil control you've got good speed sometimes the ffar feels like an smg and you can beat mac 10 users with this thing as well it's just devastating really but joe's is really good man don't really play that often but this was a good game and andy doesn't really play much war zone but recently he's been back on it a bit so i've been playing a few rounds with him and getting him back up to speed with things and he's someone who hasn't really kept up with the game so he hasn't got the meta weapons unlocked really like he didn't get cold war i don't think he even unlocked the a max because by the time it came out he stopped playing modern warfare and warzone so he was using the m4 here i was trying to drop him guns whenever i could or if an enemy had a decent map 10 build or ffar build i would say pick this one up this is a good one that's interesting like to see that kind of perspective from a player who hasn't played the game in a while and they just stuck with an m4 which is still a really good gun the m4 is a great all-rounder but when you've got things like the amax and the ffar the mach 10 and you're playing in competitive lobbies you need to have kept up with it just difficult to compete i suppose and i do wonder will the problem be exacerbated the more guns they add to the game the more time that the games bring out because they'll keep fleshing things out unless they start vaulting things which i don't know they kind of seem reluctant to do that especially with the fact that the stem is still in the game and probably like 0.1 of players actually use that legitimately and the rest of them just find a way to glitch it and then either be invincible or stay in the gas for the entire match but there you go it's gonna be a really interesting year for warzone for sure a big map change though would be really good right now i still really enjoy this map though i think the level design is pretty good there's only a few areas now where i'm like okay what you could do with the rappel here or a ladder there but it's just one or two places and for how many hours i've played this game i'm still not bored of the map i think they've done a cracking job with it in that respect but new pois are definitely welcomed a new map completely maybe but i don't want them to go down the pudgy route where you can pick between two big maps i'd rather that they just kept it as one map so they either just put the dance to the side if they introduce a new map or refresh it whatever i don't want to have two big maps as an option because i think that would just divide the player base and increase the matchmaking times all that bad stuff pubg had a really bad time with that kind of thing but i reckon they'll just always keep it to one big map and then just have those ltm limited time modes for smaller maps like rebirth on the side and i'm cool with that now coming to the end of the match here i don't know how we just survived that engagement on the roof just some lucky timing with the servers and we were moving over to super still 90 people left i don't know how i got away with that one and that dude only had a milano and a pistol maybe just heard me a bit too late and we're trying to push this building because we wanted to take control of it for the next zone and there was a squad in the top and bottom of it and it's such an annoying building to push especially if you've got good players in here they set up a claim at the top of the stairs we took out the one downstairs just chilled in here for a bit and then we were getting pushed by a different squad outside precision air strikes coming in left right and center and i just don't trust the airstrikes because sometimes i've been in buildings and they've killed me i don't know it appears that some buildings they penetrate inconsistently so who knows i mean it's throwing the bodies around there the rag dolls left right and center but we had to move 10 seconds to go we're like okay let's go out to the right got the kill on one of the other guys outside but the other two are still in the building andy goes down gets finished off and it was from a different guy who was hiding in the garages over here that was him just some random dude and i'm in trouble but i managed to bind me back but they're still above me they heard the respawn they know that i'm here and i'll just get absolutely dumped on when they jump out the window maybe i should just air strike it and run away that could have been a good strategy there bit of a risky play perhaps but something to consider for the future if i ever find myself in that kind of situation again but with that said that's all for today folks once again i'm asking you what do you think is going to happen with that boat that's off the coast of a dance right now what's inside it what will happen put your guesses down in the comments below and as always a massive thank you to all these people using my supporter creator code in the cod store if you use my code jack frags in all caps in the store and you buy anything i'll
