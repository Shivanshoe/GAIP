hi everyone and welcome to call of duty vanguard this is part one of my walkthrough of the single player campaign and a big thanks to activision for sponsoring this video and providing me with early access to the game in this episode you'll see the first three missions and i have to say that i'm thoroughly enjoying it so far it's surprisingly dark and gritty the graphics are on point and there's some great action moments also i am playing this on pc with ultra settings at 4k if you want to watch this in the best quality leave a like and a comment to help support the video let's do this nazi germany the final push into the heart of darkness the soe had recruited the six of us under my command for one reason to retrieve files on the top secret project phoenix the last gasp of the third rank a coalition of allied commandos thrown together and aimed at where our enemy was most vulnerable this was meant to be our first and only mission would you look at that hell of a wall who's up for saving it that's here we go well that's a good start if we secure the trade we have a chance i don't want me to open the door no one there door number two whoa i'll cover you from this boxcar remember i don't want them to see us coming they can't see anything when they're dead climbing up there like a pro taking people out there's a guy here take down the last cigarette take one jerry out i bet the trouba takes the other she's good actually got another one door's locked look for another way in let me get down the side here i can use the flying fire here get that spg so much for our secret mission looks like we're doing this the hard way get on the other trains and flank those crowds not very secret anymore is it good job it's locked let's not chance it take the roof this time off we go hello surprise they've got trucks oh my goodness let's shoot the driver yeah wow it's a wall of guns so many options i kind of like this suppressed stand though yes they're on the top oh there he is what the bloody hell is he doing no you got to get off that wow that's awesome on that truck sweet lng on the truck is it something there alright i'll get it mg42 yes now we're talking out of that truck driver's about there that effect is so cool the bodies went fine just opened by itself a little bit of ammo all right let's what are we doing hey in these trucks a bit dangerous isn't it in between trains we're getting close to the engine car better hurry the man said these tracks are gonna split of course they are i want the track to split give me a nightmare get a bit closer they don't keep up very well do they he doesn't like those trucks no i don't i can get the turret of this oh i will nice bit of destruction there beautiful ah quite dangerous especially for these guys yeah you're just showing up i was gonna bash him to death [Music] oh it's lucky it was loaded the absolute mad lad shoot the driver get some ammo time for this train to stop my friend i've got to jump the tracks are splitting we got it good job team what was your uncle [ __ ] me dead now that we've been properly shot at mike the officer in charge tell us what the hell we're doing here that submarine base is our final stop once we're in we move to secure the objective he wants us to secure it but he won't tell us what it is kingsley's been dancing around there since the get-go this ain't just another easter egg on his airmaid what's a bloody story we don't quite know you mean the eso [ __ ] he doesn't quite know you know what i'm gonna go pull the brakes all we have is a name phoenix so we got no idea what we're up against that's the mission to find out soe says the krauts are moving something big out of germany it could be a document stash the holiest of holies we are here to pinch it if this is so important why did they not send an army they did there's six of us mate we're not from the same army hell we're not even from the same continent quiet get back why would we chosen for this [ __ ] suicide mission brass handpicked six specialists hit the crowds fast and get away clean an army can't do that too loud too slow which is right they won't see us coming in and out with those papers before they know it do we understand the plan i shoot nazis they die that's my plan it's not about fun [Music] the entrances past the rail yard just across these tracks let's get those papers before jerry's any wiser i'll cover you from this boxcar christ please do doggo let's get it done take them out oh that's no good i love the sound of this sounds awesome guy there i think that would be ideal it's quite hard to see with all this rain the entrance is dead ahead almost there keep going dogs more doggos that's a sniper here they come move it everyone inside wade jackson apparently these are all based off real people i don't think the names are all the same but the characters in this game were inspired by them smoke is that right i'm just gonna throw some grenades more grenades oh no he's not dead no we've got loads of attack dogs we're going in let's go off it [Music] this must be it jackson get the door nobody there we missed a hell of a party looks like they left in a hurry phoenix we must be close not for long crowds are moving their stash onto a sub see that lot lugging that chest i bet you london to a brick that is what we're after so what are we waiting for time to bring the heavy stuff now we're talking wait we can't go in loud arthur whatever's in those papers is the best kept secret in the third reich and the crowds kept them here in the ass end of nowhere so what it makes no sense it's like leaving the crown jewels on the front porch with hardly anyone watching them the entire german army should be guarding this place we're not the only ones who don't know what phoenix is you're saying nazis are keeping secrets from nazis i'm saying the ones in charge of the secrets are the most dangerous yeah that's why we brought the guns to shoot them are we done here those papers are about to piss off out of germany you three take the catwalk and make your bloody noise buy us time web novak you're with me we'll take the boat so it's a secret organization within the nazis at the end of the war some great animation so far we'll cover you from the catwalk man look for a way out don't shoot us lucas oh i got the boost oh the sniper rifle i have to take that [Music] they're escaping there's way more down there for a couple maids maybe let's me out a sniper rifle ammo i think that's a stun grenade kind of thing there we kicked the hornet at least that's not a minefield this time [Music] oh wait at the top reload this and start picking them off they got a machine gun there or something look at that guy oh another machine gun keep pushing up i think they're all dead some more ammo here that's the car 98 i don't think i need that when i've got that sniper grenade at me there's so many my friends up there let's go we've got to push through that's the stop in the next peg in a choke point oh get away from me i think we did it i saw him load the crate on that sub cover us we're going aboard good luck kids i found us a way out of here cheers buddy i'm going on the sub there's the hatch this is it lads tactical let's find that crate and get out of here richard watch our backs go back you take the lead eyes straight ahead watch the ricochet that's cheeky the ai can fly around the corners as well i've got some nice bread there get back get back [Music] gas grenade no i just broke you're all right i'm good mate it's going to be the command room let's get that hatch open stay close tossing grenade i mean that's going to do a lot of damage [Music] squeeze through that no one else here there's the box no back you've got a safe cracker do the honest will you no problem mate let's have a look [Music] arthur the sirens are stopped they can't be good we gotta move now maybe help me oh wait rectangulars australia yeah he's very perceptive i know so you get on with it i delightfully you think you're british a cambridge man through and through what's up you know better than to ruin a man's evening they dobbins forza mata has exquisite but demanding passages that deserve my full attention unlike you does the negro give orders in english ah please proceed your rhineland accent you must be from neustadt during the occupation you saw french soldiers who look like me carry guns in your streets marry your women that's what i hear when you speak german we thrashed you once hear those bombs that's us thrashing you again what an interesting choice of words i told you already get on with it yeah that's what you want to sacrifice yourself to be a leader i'm not here to give you what you want quite a concert [Music] what you say dispose of it but the rest in the truck jesus christ people die people die when command [ __ ] up how exactly is this arthur's fault this is on him adam wade abandoning his team well you're right about wait if he shows his face again i'm bloody killing myself oh yes let's keep blaming each other instead of the germans is that supposed to impress me relax it does not matter verizinger is going to kill us all surprisingly the nazi the one who killed novak old friend of yours is he we have history oh yeah what caught it against fryzinger arthur will get us out of this what because he's your mate it wasn't always but i've seen him in action you lose men that's war sometimes the only way to honor a fallen soldier is to finish the mission but try remembering that while their blood stains your boots if you're meant to lead you have to learn what it's like to lose men to have them die trusting you there is only one way to learn that lesson the first time i did was on d-day we've got until dawn to achieve our objective and it seems like the crowds already know we're coming now we've got one chance to demolish the coastal artillery but if we don't the invasion tomorrow will fail now i trade you all for this let's not let the navy show us up so take the case mates blast the artillery and fire your flesh to let them even know the jobs done all right this is it you know the drill stand up okay stand by step [Music] [Music] uh whoa well that was pretty intense oh they're searching for me nothing to say okay let's go what was that how's the soldier there aah i've only got two bullets [Music] there's two guards there another two there planes just being shot down i don't think those guys are going to see me there's something here make some ammo does that work yeah it looks like it we've got a guy there i've got to go in there do a takedown on this one yeah he turned away 13 shots now oh that effect is so cool he's right above me some stairs here oh my goodness that scared the hell out of me whoa well they know i'm here now they're putting flares in might as well start shooting move up a bit oh no dogs there's another one somewhere there's so many there i throw grenades tam that was intense full refill here there's a rabbit this mp4 he's got a 64 round mag wow the flaming windmill we've got some brits over there let's get in give me those grenades we're clear i think we're clear all right lads thunder thunder don't shoot damn you kingsley we picked you as a crowd lucky we didn't fill you full of lead richard webb thomas jones nice to see you gents where do we stand captain didn't make it so we're on our own now let's say we dig in and wait for the rest of the sick airborne to assemble henry said we have till dawn to destroy the artillery if we don't the invasion fails so you fancy yourself the captain now sunup's an hour away at best there's no time for a down yeah there's also no muscle or no cavalry coming to save the bloody day the only thing we can do here is to die or try not to you two scrapping over's got the bigger bollocks ain't gonna solve nothing those german casemates aren't that far away i think we can get to them in time so i say we take them out the company's scattered we're pissing in the wind at this point i know what's at stake you all do this is madness hey we're beyond madness look i'm with arthur we finished the mission all right kingsley looks like you're in charge now casemates and valhalla are that way i'm in charge we should get moving what's the plan kingsley barrier i can give them orders clear that debris jones do you think that's a reference to tom jones seen as that guy's welsh crawl through here come on lads don't blame yourself the whole operation was a mess from the up hey that showed up late in the night of those time on the cliff that's the coastal defense battery the bridge is well guarded and the bank's too steep we secure the bridge then it's our only move you're the boss and we gotta get all the way up there across the bridge keep low watch that truck we have an opportunity here stay quiet and get close now we can ambush them multiple targets so i can attack right left or truck attack the truck all fire on the truck move up we got them all that was cool very nice i open the window i think we should push down get into that building where did you come from where's the door are they gonna breach it it's full call of duty now look at this get in there that's sick awesome i didn't expect to be able to command my squad that's kind of neat enemies retreating seems like you can only select others reset things push no i blast it lads i've played plenty of call of duty campaigns before where cars blow up and do a lot of damage let's go let's go suppress it we need a grenade give it a shot i got it made yes all right let's move it everyone on that transport who remembers how to try to blitz i got this a blitz is that what they call these [Music] well that was a [ __ ] kerfuffle hey sarge got it done still here aren't we i suppose eight men standing against the nazi gunfort richard said i got mad sometimes a little madness is called for i think deep down he understood that and realized we were cut from the same cloth no problem tom jones little rally point here prepare to assault the gun battery thomas bender legal how's it looking sergeant let's see for yourself let's get you the lay of the land our targets are the guns housed in those casemates and we can only get there through a horde of germans armed to the teeth there's a lot of germans there i think you can handle taking out the lower gun i fancy my chances that bunker's our way in but it's packed with mgs it'll be a hard push first job's getting across that minefield but that anti-tank dish could be useful bit cover there maybe i've got an idea i'm always we can punch a hole through the mines with those blitzers there and the bunker will make minced meat out to us as soon as they hear the engines coming we're going quiet then no engines better the last second let gravity do the work that should get us to the ditch at least well i love it i think you should go first all right then as soon as you hit the ditch get the men ready tommy you with me oh yeah drive through the minefield take the bunkers drop some thermite to some highly explosive weapons piece of piss sarge can you get a second sun burning in the sky if our ships don't see that flare if they don't know we've won they'll fire on the guns and risk taking us with them well i don't know about you but i think i'll take very little consolation in knowing that the fire that killed me was friendly worry girl i won't forget to wear him up ah the character models are really good there are some guns here weren't there sten and the bar they are extended mag yeah go on then can i get ammo again right so i've got to drive this into that ditch without the engine on speed here goes nothing i've just got directional control oh no i think that did it getting that ditchlands yeah there's a lot of ngs [Applause] all right we're in further down are we going over the top [Music] you know what i'm gonna put some smoke grenades up maybe that's gonna give us a bit of cover charge go go go forward [Music] blow that back up all dead some ammo back smoke grenades i'm sure i'm going to need those ready ready on the door just waiting for your boss you take the lower case mates i'll take the offer once don't forget the flare let's move up research all right boys this is it you're not me oh my god do i get back we need to clear the door well tommy's dead [Music] jeez [Music] put some pressure on it oh right there maybe i should switch the beer keep pushing keeping that track down that sounds amazing i think maybe we'll need some more smoke grenades here put on there are we going to use that as cover yeah i'm trying to stay behind it stay behind the heart track smoke get those mt's a target move this thing down stick on it push up stay covered get into the next trench then we can move around i didn't reload no it's a good replay time for melee oh that was close i thought i was dead then for sure we made it to the top of 77. geez are you through the grenade to him get it in there evans take points got it sarge lights are out i'll cover ahead while you find a torch sarge bloody hell it stinks in here sarge torch over here i knew that was coming look at that [ __ ] monster here's the first gun one down one to go that's the last of the thermite swords i could use your help here i like that they've gone with the to scale environments in this game like modern warfare 19. this makes it feel really tight and claustrophobic he was going for a bayonet charge then let's go phillip now every crowd knows we're here i mean it's a horror game then [Music] that legitimately gave me a jump scare all right who threw that then it's clear sounds like webb did his part the rest is up to us good i'll feed it at bangalore i don't think the gun wants to eat a bangalore well in this case it will have to let's get up top before this thing explodes it's gonna be a big bang you have the flares go get out and fire the flare sleeping on the sergeant the boys bombardment's any minute dab oh no you gotta be [ __ ] oh no where's webb [Applause] there lower casemate incoming get down get everyone to cover oh no we are going to get shell whoa i just pulled up in a truck and the truck's dead go go [Music] [Music] where the hell have you been plenty time to take a kip i was just waiting for some outcaster to come and save the day well let's you and i signal our boy shall we [Music] we lost our captain but we'd won the day and we'd honored the memory of all those we lost the only way we could by completing the mission you look at the soldiers under your command and hope that they can do the difficult thing the impossible thing that flare told me i'd been right this is what it means to be a leader [Music] from all the flags waving on the streets we'd never have known the nazis were about to lose the war but bullies are always loudest when they're scared and when they're desperate they get stupid commander herman freisinger had killed novak then he'd given us a free ride right into the lion's allied den stormed the shores of europe the fewer arts concerning people read the field report twice this ally team is fascinating they have been captured but it was too close i want you to find out everything you can about this unit it will be my pleasure sir you will speak of this to noah knows and report directly to me hallelujah this prison is our battlefield christ what is that smell chlorine dioxide they think it hides the smell of death well this is the nicest [ __ ] i've ever been in is anyone else hungry so i am happy fiora richter and piss off crowd unless you got room service for us and i have questions for you yeah we can always bloody questions i'm the commanding officer you'll speak with me even then richter was easy to read uniforms at high rank no compact metal office rad the perfect mark surrounded by three guards all armed and all wankers in all my years studying allies i have never come across such an unusual unit kingsley arthur lieutenant service number 25232642 tell you a story i have spoken with zafura on exactly one occasion he recommended a book to me the passing of the great race by an american a man named madison grant shifura had nothing betrayed for him [ __ ] madison grant and everyone like him the book reveals that under extreme duress or unfavorable conditions your people do not deteriorate so easily in that moment i knew what i had to do right to the super stone or notch below the clavicle once we had what we needed from this racist bastard that's where i would put my knife my plan began to take shape we were being held in the basement of gestapo headquarters around and above us was a treasure trove of classified nazi intelligence project phoenix had to be there somewhere and richter was our ticket he thought he was the interrogator if he was to be of any use to us he'd have to keep thinking that that arrogant nazi in his clean pressed uniform loved the sound of his own voice the hard part wouldn't be fooling richter into spilling what he knew of project phoenix the hard part would be convincing the others not to kill him first the allies somehow knew about project phoenix we must have a traitor amongst the officers i pulled their files take care of them with the other non-essentials lieutenant kings they mentioned a project phoenix likely allied propaganda the negro thought he was protecting his team no doubt to prove himself to make him their leader the allies must have been desperate he said it was their first mission that his sixth man is dead he's probably lying i will uncover the truth are the other teams like this one how did is temple half at risk of being compromised these are the things i need to know there's more stake here than i'm at liberty to discuss just know that i'm counting on you here i understand thank you so much well i see 10 fingers that's a good sign at least don't make a bus i'm fine listen they know about wade they haven't caught him yet i told him he was killed didn't you on the train to hamburg i don't think they'll fall for it but the hope is it'll buy him some time to get us out he isn't coming back for us she's right kingsley we can't count on that [ __ ] drongo bring out the girl [Music] she ain't going nowhere man i'll just get out of my way whose name is [Music] every person on this team was a hero in their own right long before their files ever reached my desk but to say they were strong personalities would be a vast understatement particularly when it came to petrova have you seen my again it's bad enough i have to wear this thing at all no it's flammable last year's teaching me how to shoot wasted stuck in a med tent don't be in a rush to fight dodging glory is worth nothing when you are dead but this fight it matters you matter you and misha are all i have left hey be nice i'm

there guys pouring out the hotel very satisfying firing this gun [Music] he was throwing a grenade drop down here yep [Music] [Music] ow oh quick retreat into the sewer surviving stalingrad was no small feat escaping even greater but no one really escaped something like that the nazi war machine had touched all our lives burned away something important think that's what made us attractive to the soe in the first place but for polina the wound was narrow deep she was destined to return the favor and that had made her the deadliest member of my team [Music] such a touching story you couldn't even save the life of your own father so tell me why isn't ivan with an old rifle part of a top-secret allied operation you do not scare me little mouse you misunderstand me for a line i do not need you to fear me i need only your screams that will convince your friends to talk why because i am a woman [Music] tell me what other missions the allies have in germany nothing more talking about so what is worth talking about prolonged rising confetti i'll confirm my story together take her back send me all the records on a commander steiner and any photographs of the russian sniper lady nightingale yes is that one and yeah frightening i was just coming to see you we have confirmation from the woman the sixth ally is dead is that so american arrested a temple of trying to steal a plane this makes no sense the prisoners made a fool of you richter and now you have made a fool of me the american is being brought here now if i must interrogate him myself then i have no use for you
