today we've got some actual battlefield 6 news it's not a leak it's not a rumor it's not a conspiracy theory this is real information about the next battlefield game yesterday ea had their quarterly earnings call and they revealed some details about the next battlefield game that i wanted to share with you guys because i think this is quite interesting so getting straight into it there's two sections really the first bit is a few comments from andrew wilson who's the ceo of electronic arts and he said the following dice is creating our next battlefield game with never before seen scale the technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise we have hands-on play testing underway internally and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we begin to engage our community the next battlefield is set to launch in holiday 2021 we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring so that's pretty cool and they did mention the next battlefield game ea play back in june when they did that little stream but all we saw was a tech demo with a load of soldiers running around some random bloke's face and a modern looking building being destroyed but i think if you take this with what andrew said here we can make some assumptions never before seen scale well that says to me that the next battlefield game will have bigger maps and higher player counts that's the obvious conclusion that i'd make from that i'm not saying that i'm right he could just be talking about the scale of the detail of the game the level of destruction all sorts of things it's a bit vague that's on purpose but to me i think that means more players and bigger maps and then a bit about the next gen consoles as well first thing that comes to mind to me well that means that the next battlefield game will probably only be available on pc xbox one series x or s and playstation 5. to me that's the right move i don't want to see dice and battlefield bogged down by hardware that's seven to eight years old and because of how powerful these new consoles are it means that we could see some substantial changes to the gameplay and the scope and scale of battlefield i do wonder what that means to you guys though in terms of gameplay let me know down in the comments what you think keep in mind that when we're talking about the next gen consoles it's not just about having better graphics and ray tracing it's also the fact that the ps5 and the xbox series x have nvme ssds in which means incredibly fast loading times they've also got loads of memory and that opens up a whole host of gameplay opportunities that just weren't possible on the older systems and that could have been holding a lot of design choices back and then of course we've got the holiday 2021 release date i think most of us expected that i'd imagine end of october early november next year and they're going to show the game off in the spring awesome typically dyson ea reveal their new battlefield games in may or june so i expect that that's when we'll get our first proper solid look of whatever they're cooking up here so that's the first section there was another comment about this too just before we get into a question that was asked and this was about the growth of the company netbookings that kind of thing ea are now guiding fiscal 2021 netbooking so netbookings is online transactions to be 11 higher than fiscal 2020. this is incredible growth some driven by the sheltering place orders but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services content and games to players even with a strong year we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year the growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles including battlefield our blockbuster sports titles need for speed in the titles we moved out of fiscal 21 to 22. it's interesting that they led with battlefield there so it means that they've probably got a lot of confidence in that product and yeah with it being an earnest call of course they're going to have confidence in their product right but they led with it there i think that says something so later on they did a few questions and one of them was from an analyst called alex and they said we've seen a lot of game delays in the space recently and even on the triple a side so just curious as you think towards next year in battlefield obviously that's a big theme for fiscal 2022. can you provide an update about how you're feeling about the development process and if there's any risk a year from now that maybe that game doesn't launch on time it would be helpful to get an update there andrew wilson steps in and answers there's some stuff about apex there and a couple of other games but in the context of battlefield he said yeah great question again as we think about battlefield next year again you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing we're starting to go out to our community and get feedback i was part of the product review last week we have rallied the entire studio around the development of battlefield specifically we've given them an extra year of development you'll remember to ensure that they can in fact build a true next-gen vision around that game so it's obviously a big concerted effort from the entirety of dice working on the next battlefield game they don't mention any other games that they're working on i assume that they do have other projects in development though but it appears that the focus is on battlefield and then andrew wilson goes on dice is one of the most talented studios on the planet we've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence and our ability to launch that game next year so lots more to come in the next couple of months but even in the face of challenges i think we've demonstrated an ability to launch amazing games and content i feel really really good about the content we've got coming next year so if all goes to plan it doesn't appear that there'll be a delay i think most of us as fans and players of battlefield would prefer if there wasn't but also ultimately we want the game to be good and we want it to work when it launches that's the most important thing and if that means that the game is delayed i'm all for that and i think most battlefield fans would be too but as of yesterday during that call it appears that they're confident it will release on time and that's about it those are some of the snippets the facts about battlefield from the e8 earnings call yesterday some really exciting stuff yeah there's not that much detail but i wanted to make a video on this anyway because i think it's important and if you've missed this then now you know make your own mind up and take from that whatever you will with that said thank you for watching guys let me know your thoughts down in
