I found something that I never really experimented with when battlefield 4 was very popular if you've seen my most recent escape from tarkov video you'll know that I ended up taking out a player who was carrying a thermal scope and it got me thinking you know I never really used the thermal scopes in battlefield 4 and I wanted to figure out what the best way of doing that would be so what I ended up doing here was building a jng 90 now this was one of my favorite bolt-action rifles in the game and I've put a 2 times FLI our scope on it it's a thermal scope I've got counted iron sights just in case I need to switch them close range I've got the suppressor as well so I can keep a low profile and of course the straight pull bolt so I can keep shooting while I'm in the scope so I thought how can I effectively use this in the game well if you find a server that's running hardcore mode most bolt-action rifles will kill you in one hit so I thought well you know what that's going to be a pretty good scenario here also hardcore mode has 3d spotting turned off and also the death camp so if I kill a few people on a nice flank or something they're not going to be able to tell where I was unless they actually see me so this will allow me to be quite sneaky and of course the suppressor on the end there is going to help a lot with that said I found a server that was running rush and that's a really good game mode to try this kind of thing on because if you're defending there's a definitive front line where you know the attackers will be and if you get on the flanks you can really do damage with this kind of setup so we're gonna skip to propaganda on Rush and see how it went enjoy right so what I want to do is try and push up on the left hand side here watch out for grenades and also you know hardcore modes got 20 firearm so there's got to be a bit mindful that I'm gonna post up here I think it wasn't sure that was a guy but it was there's another do back there - is that it yeah no hit Marcus either killed by grenade fair play that has a good shot back on the left hand side here team are actually throwing flare story [Applause] look at that just Blair's money really good counsel you come up against this let's try the why instead I'm body maybe it's definitely someone there because he like a little Fleck a white or something there we go that's a head the scope just doesn't move as well delay that guy [Applause] wait for him to stand still the headshot no he's onto me Scooby Doo Dah Mia I'm gonna PI think that guy's got one too you know he shoot me through the trees there hey we got a bad back remember those really good it was like a tree in the way but I think I'd be very difficult to see because there's no 3d spotting but I can just see them sticking out like a sore thumb how you doing are you teabagging someone don't do that that's rude I feel like I want to push up though on this right hand side here oh man that the pig nest there it is well I thought he added me then got the deagle though as my secondary it's powerful I'm where I want to be now that how did you get past me tell us too easy now gotta fall back now I'm gonna defend this be flanked here it's a long corridor known on the right this kind of spot is perfect for it because people just line up for you like so that's clear oh he was right girl that grand ol time Wow his bullets I couldn't go with the deagle porn understeer there delete us your bacon goodbye that was a collateral what are the second bodies there look at that it's definitely someone else here see that was quick that was a nice workshop they just walk into everybody there's something really satisfying about what that was that we got behind us again here's another one that ran past there how do that miss I'm dead definitely unstable over there really like this blank what let that one go more for some things to do here go here thing to guys collapse all come on it's gonna be patient now you're friendly you know if I can gain the bus I didn't even know you get on the roof there chillin here I feel safe [Music] did any of those guys actually realize where they were being shot from there I'm not sure maybe not nope bullet didn't quite fit hazal oh that's a shame he was going in for the deeper I've got to give him credit for that though that's a nice try I appreciate the meemers that are still playing before a lot of guys here yes there we go oh that's too many targets oh dear that was good fun positive it that was really fun what is that what's that light is that a laser I've never gotten laser on right I it's really distracting it's like a really good counter that the IOSCO look at this look at that how am I supposed to hit that all right left cuts on I'm getting away from laser guy love that there's another one there no Kilda from this Ryan saw his say what's going on there Estelle but they were on the room friendly fire Oh by distracting me so much and I'm dead and if this guy here I think you might be rocking the derma scope - I was several here look what's the friendlies just throwing that corridor oh man it's just too good isn't it it's really fun though honestly guys try this out if you have it if you can find a server that's still running hardcore like this one this one's on PC but I don't know if you'll be able to find out my console maybe maybe you will grenade cool now I think we got it I'm gonna go two tickets sir GG enjoy that a lot I just don't believe that I didn't do this back in the day like I don't know maybe it's just hardcore my perhaps unnormal it's not as effective but give it a shot see for yourself with that said I hope you enjoyed the video today guys if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
