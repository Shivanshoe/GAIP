love you every day i'm good thank you i can't wait to see you again be glad to see you again okay now say bye-bye this is unsc pelican echo 216. can you hear me [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like the main power cells are fried bottles auto shutdown triggering survival mode i'm going to try to override okay if you can hear me in there i hope you're ready please don't die please [Music] yes yes yes we're going home oh welcome back chief i rerouted what little power i had into your suit i'm seeing a fault on the calibration matrix at least i think it's a calibration matrix okay follow the light look up now let's look down it wants me to see if i want inverted control zone this has been in like three different halo games at the start let's try right and now lift your visor feed and motor function seem to be operational but it looks like there's a problem with the servos in your hands try moving it stay calm you've been out there a while i know i saw something in here to check the diagnostics on your armor oh easy there big guy you're not status report status report what there's something you need to see chief [Music] we lost lost everything there's nothing left for us here [Music] i don't even know where here is [Music] then not again we need to run i need a weapon weapon this is all i've got it's enough [Music] wait what improvise close the door [Music] ah the main batteries are shut down we're stuck out here [Music] so i see you work on the batteries i'll buy us some time i don't believe it you made it now what well that was cool i love how they're going for that continuous shot thing as well stasis beam weapons all of it how will you get back i'll figure something out i don't think i've seen a camera cut yet be gone grunts i can pick these up can't i can multiplayer eliminate chief do it fast this ragdoll is is crazy you're damn right green man's here i always feel bad taking them out you know but they're secretly so evil [Music] hello he seems annoyed at me the guy that started i know we met so it starts with master chief getting his ass kicked briefly oh that's not going to get old the grappling hook so good it's really good in multiplayer i've played a bit of multiplayer already of course first time playing the campaign here i can just grab that it's a big playground isn't it really [Music] you guys can count how many of these i end up throwing get bad guys i can grapple while i'm carrying it as well which is pretty neat [Music] that's a good way to get rid of the shield on those jackals i think these are called jackals aren't they oh that seems dangerous that sound is so good it's so good i don't think my grapple would reach up there would it a bit too high up maybe drop ships an invasion force against all these the banished one already we could be the only two humans left alive out here then there's still hope such an iconic voice he's on cameo isn't he happy birthday from the master chief one day someone will do that for me okay there's some [Music] grenades no ammo refills here doesn't look like it i love the magnum though i don't think i could drop it [Music] and the graphics are so nice [Music] i'm picking up some more grenades shouldn't i oh some here well that's a bit of a coincidence excuse me sir so many jackals [Music] i wanted one of those explody things i can grapple grenades to me of course i need to kind of rewire my brain and play this differently because of that grapple hook i'm not right there [Music] [Applause] here we go really powerful as long as you get the helmet off you'll find some cosmonauts here i'll take this with me this looks like a bigger one doesn't it [Music] yes oh no i missed maybe i can flank these or something i don't know i feel like that's what the game wants me to do i mean it started off pretty classic halo hasn't it guys corridor shooter there's a big open world element to this game as well of course [Music] they can get through your health so quick can i take this yes see this right here this reminds me so much of halo 3. now these big red guys again what's up lads your approaches soon the banished will stand victorious [Music] patriarchs hear these words even from beyond this life your will is served forces occupy the rain within ours it will be under our control humanity will cower before your legacy they will better their praise and defiance will be all but a memory they're talking about this atriox guy like he's dead but he was clearly there right at the start so i don't know what's going on there [Music] do i still got my plasma cannon we have a new problem no it's gone we need to get out of here i'm working on it i'm working harder these pelicans nearly on board and the power's still out don't let them get me right in the middle of them can i drop down yeah i can do a little flank over here that's plasma isn't it yeah apparently there is like all sorts of upgrades you can get for your suit as well we've not seen any of that yet oh the mid-air this guy's a bit tough isn't he flying around in his jet pack these brutes we gotta go up here it's got to be this main control panel there right it's locked down requires a hack okay and you can do that no new [Music] apex legends by the way guys do you know sounds almost like him the same voice actor lots of enemies here i think i think i'm just going to shoot that thing yeah that looks right it was making a noise you know when things make a noise usually you're doing something right i'm not done yet well hurry i can see them the little things all waiting the little things isn't it okay we've got to get out again now probably just made things explode there didn't i is that oh hello yes this thing is great in the multiplayer i love it a bit difficult to get used to but when you do just ruin people [Music] i can hear some bodies over there [Music] overload the engines the sounds are so good hello something better the master chief returns we thought you did tossed into the void yet here you stand humans call you their savior covenant the demons prey destroy this craft if you must it matters not the banished will hunt you down pursue you wherever you run not happy who is that do you know him no well he knows you he knows all about you you need to hurry get back here i don't know how long this ship will hold together do i know him what obviously not oh my god oh want to avoid all the debris here it's the right way oh they're scared of me that doesn't sound you think good disruption will be enough there is on the against i'm sure we will isn't that that's part of the cutscene that they first showed isn't it when they revealed the game a few years back and it didn't look great but they've delayed it lows and it looks way better now oh wow god they're trying to get in on my way octane i'm coming tony thank you for the 50. that's very funny [Music] oh my god so i really needed my grapple hook to be off cooldown that way oh i'm going in i'm sorry oh that was close that was really close stop shooting at me i'm trying to survive okay so 90 seconds i hope this place holds together that long charge faster so [Music] oh damn [Music] oh come on get on there chief let's go this is a great start to the game i'm really into this [Music] chief you still with me i'm here [Music] okay give me a second i'm going to get you welcome back okay let's get out of here you told me how's that grappler [Music] locate unsc infiniti unsc infinity class super carrier crow size 7150 not found near field perimeter scan 1986 unsc tags detected status deceased the master chief lives assured us you promised us revenge superiority threatens everything you question my leadership atriox is dead it is his fault that we are stuck here the finest not the products not here [Music] this ring will be operational please blade master follow spartan from distance i want to know everything about him who was that chap [Music] locate message and source we're done right chief if we stay out here any longer they're gonna come back they'll find us and they'll kill us what is it you're searching for signal located there's nothing there you're looking in the wrong direction we need to go home plot the waypoint requesting manual flight control override do it autopilot wait what are you kidding me why would we go down there the banished plan to wipe us out all of us and what you think we can stop them on our own i told you we lost we need help not heroics no we do our duty protect humanity whatever the cost i can't be the only atmosphere we have a new mission soldier what's down there a weapon a weapon how many guns do you need what is wrong with you remind me to never pick up this person this is a terrible idea they're coming for us all of them incoming all directions it's not safe we finally saw it okay [Applause] what about shields why is this place heads off lots of vanishcraft hitting your way are the electric oh yes seems like when you use it on the jackals with their shield you get a little bit more range yeah i don't think you can dual wield i know somebody asked in chat it was halo 2 wasn't it that they introduced your wheel there you okay down there i thought you wanted to find a way into the main structure [Music] oh these guys must be worth it this whole place looks like it's dying i suppose i could just grapple onto that couldn't cling to life somehow this guy's a bit tough each ring is different i see an entry point in the wall ahead get in there find this weapon then we can go right if i can stick him no it fell off i wanted his gun the needler needle is a bit underpowered in multiplayer he's sick back in halo 3 days be careful they're still coming you really pissed them off back there you're damn right what the hell is that [Music] he was going to jump off the edge i'm getting do maternal feelings from the combat that's a good thing [Music] you died [Applause] oh [Music] it's too far away for that yeah headshots with this do so much damage suck on that [Music] [Music] in katana get all corrupted in the last game she sided with the forerunners and decided to try and kill everything in the galaxy we spider jack yeah it does feel like it with the grapple well this is ominous hi guys oh this is cool it does a bit of electric damage looks like it's really good against their shields as well [Music] damn need to go kill then so oh oh they're really good at dodging them i just want to get a sticky can i charge this up no not really got him damn i did not like flying those what did you have paul's carbine okay it's an audio tree what are those things this is four on the right i've heard the stories but man this is crazier than i imagined way they make the forerunners [Music] in these little pods how do you know this isn't a trap i don't great i hope this weapon of yours is worth the risk i'm reading multiple enemy ships heading this way too many it's been six months where have you been what happened where is cortana the rogue ai known as cortana is gone she's been deleted how by you of course not did you hit your head or something don't you remember my instructions were to enter this installation imitate cortana and lock her down for retrieval yours were to take her back to the infinity for deletion so if it wasn't you okay then there's something else on successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete still here good good my programming failed i'm not supposed to be here you need to delete me no no i was created for one purpose and that purpose is no longer needed my mission is over we have a new one the banished are planning to fire this ring we need to make sure they don't first of all what's a banished second you may have noticed that a significant piece of this installation has been damaged making that impossible and third to fire this ring they would need an activation index cortana had the index i had parts of it as well something stopped your deletion we need to find out why but this wasn't the mission the missions changed they always do are you sure [Music] the weapon interesting did you do that no removing me triggered a response from the ring i need you to understand how would you live your life how would you live your life differently that voice is cortana's no it's not her it's dust and echoes what did you say what it's just pieces of data cycling until they run out of power it's all around us today i was called an emotionless autonomous they solved faces 75 healthy subjects i find myself does live through this he is perfectly suited for what is coming [Music] there's a little john he has been assigned a number one round we've got his master chief's face it's got a flat cap on i can feel it calling out to me you can just one milo as if you get within the shield these are the banished affirmative they smell even worse than i imagined how can you smell you're an ai well an array of sensors in your armor can and i analyze the input you smell fun by the way oh thank you that's weird you think we'll ever get to a point when ai can actually smell is that possible probably not look over there that's the source the bridge is out yes it is maybe there's a way to power it back up nearby is it this button downstairs be jealous cortana stop being jealous that was an interesting sound is it safe i think so yes [Music] it's safe [Music] yes this is part of me i don't know why i don't know how but it is me it was the last part i remember being deleted let me just hmm i love how it has the gun that you're carrying in the cutscene you are here because you were chosen that's a really nice detail our enemies are getting smarter and more numerous every day what i am about to show you will help turn the tide of war i have been working to harness the strategic power of a ship born ai onto the battlefield are you ready yes dr halsey [Music] unlike previous ai models she will reside between your mind and the suit directly communicating with your neural interface look at her little feet think of her as a new set of eyes to aid your reactions you'll touch this upgrade she's not the driver but a way to level the playing field what do i call her ask her she named herself hello master chief i'm cortana together you become our newfound hope together you become our key to humanity's survival she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it [Music] what happened i touched it and was that real it's just data it's it's just here of recursive code but this on the other hand this is the framework i use to trap cortana it contains a copy of the activation index at least fragments of it what should we do with it do we need it well based on what you've told me so far the bigger question is did banished need it do it do it [Music] [Music] that was something right let's go did i miss something there's a file that's been unlocked but i don't have access we need a route out of here okay let's see there's a breach close by it should lead us to the surface i don't need a power cell for that one give me a second and i'll get this bridge activated [Music] we've got company chief meet me at the plinth up ahead i'll do the killing man you can go [Music] this sounds amazing this thing [Music] i'm gonna need some ammo on i i'll switch up so someone in chat said that this stacks so i think the more the more shots you hit them with the more damage it does [Music] okay i actually stun that one what the hell you can fry them [Music] wow you got here fast not the type to waste any time huh no noted let's go the textures look sexy yeah the textures look really good this position [Music] there's a lot of enemies i appreciate that though it's good [Music] i love that it just i'm flying into the sky see if i can do it with this guy here that's fun banished audio log okay [Music] no rtx in this game no i don't think so even in my darkest moments when i feel the most wisdom continues to impress me i regret that i ever doubted him his talk of forerunner festival your soul eternal a lot of faith in this aatrox chop isn't that what's wrong this gravity lift should be powered up we need to find a way to bring it back online this object it's part of the ring's life force it's called a power seed here we go is that a checkpoint when he makes that noise [Music] sorry what how am i enjoying the multiplayer yeah i really like it it's good stop just wish there was more maps we need to find out what happened that is a spartan that's cool [Music] shield upgrade she was carrying an enhanced shield module let's see what i can find out about her it was a name accessing this is spartan bonita stone recon specialist her vitals have been offline for nearly a month cause of death was an energy blade but different stronger a single strike she never saw it coming active camera that's really sad so here that elevator should take us to the surface go around here i don't want to be sniped thank you snipers are really infamous in halo games just being annoying yourself it's that purple laser over there i hate that come in there's someone in here is that you get skulls in this i presume you can it was one for was it halo 3 where when you get a head shot it goes like yay and then confetti comes out of their heads you guys remember that one what can i do with this just crackle onto it i presume that just makes a big explosion we need to call down the elevator look for a control terminal oh there's one right here weapon this elevator is drawing power from the ring well it was the seed is missing the seed what's over there birthday party yeah that was it was it in reach [Music] you can find schools okay cool i bet i've walked past so many oh no it's all the way all those genetic things forerunner storage vessels cylixes silexes that's a good word i was stuck in that room for six months surrounded by them let's just say they talk a lot that should do it let's get back to the elevator oh hang on that's in the shape of an elite and that's a grunt lucas browning if you find this you need to understand they've forced me to help them with it whatever it is i brought it up from whatever's below it opened god it was something different i've never seen anything like it what was it you need to believe me it's not my fault just powered up now bing-bong this isn't forerunner it identifies as banished can you operate it in my sleep not that i sleep but oh i don't need to it was a funny joke it's already on its way down incoming oh it's a big lot in it what if it's a friend it isn't [Music] he's a really big one he did not specify in how many pieces oh no it's the first boss they got gold shields head to town i got rid of the ads cosmonaut here i've got a shield back okay oh you stopped me bulldog oh it's also shocking isn't it that's a interesting pose not friendly by the looks of him he was some sort of leader they called him tremonius not anymore he needs to go to the dentist i didn't even get to use the purple thing no no no come on i need a yellow one i don't think there's one here oh no here we go beautiful yeah this is my favorite gun in multiplayer he's doing yoga that's right michael i repeat multiple crafts are converting on your location they're coming for you sierra 117 understood i've been trying to reach you you vanished i thought i was on my okay i got your location on my way be ready octane's gonna come pick me up yeah plasma's really good against depleting shields i just don't enjoy using plasma weapons as much as the kinetic though it's always been that way inhaler what is this spartan core you've acquired a spartan core these valuable meow neo components are used to upgrade equipment oh it's like opening a chest in zelda that is another silex but this one's open oh cool look at this another problem shield core might be something good trust me it won't be you just want to upgrade your shield first surely there's a lot of upgrades here fob these little things that i can unlock targets i have no idea what that stuff is that's a forerunner isn't it looks like the diet egg or whatever his name was sorry tremoniously that's a good one and the gun combat in this game is so satisfying it nailed the feel of it terminal over there police thank you for the of the five chief's might do not fool yourself he was not the best of the banished not by any measure it occurs to me that we have not been introduced i of course know of you spartan your legend the fear you inspire is admirable the hope you stir in the hearts [Music] i need to shut this guy up i want you to know my name too to know my legend how else will you beg me for mercy i am esheram war chief of the banished this is my world now and you have little time remaining in it [Music] oh damn here we go wow look at this place full of more monsters coming to kill us we're in the open world now are we you're gonna need to clearly somewhere thank you for the ten joes very kindly okay i mean it really has just opened up here is that fuel rod as we can how good are the sounds in this game guys come on the sounds are amazing what are you doing up there i didn't even see that guy oh my god it never ends so many of them this is awesome love how it's just thrown so many enemies at me as well how about that for mercy [Music] ah this is full do my tunnel okay this guy up here as well oh my god there's so many what the hell they're just like swarming in here bring it [Music] is there a tank or anything that i could pick up [Music] i don't know if they would give you a tank so quickly you know what's over here i don't know where to go i can explore everything i'm a bit overwhelmed to be honest [Music] what's this [Music] it's a song or something [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] my [Music] [Applause] and he that died is rapidly approaching [Applause] it's kind of weird how when you play the audio like the audio in the game just completely ducks out i'm not sure i like that i feel like the balance could be a little bit better there that's the last of them we did it is it safe is anything tank cannon where's the time coming guys if you can find me somewhere to hack in i think i can guarantee this base will be safe for your friend to land i didn't see a tank cannon unless it's this thing here nope connect the camera let me see the banished are using a modification of the covenant's battlenet protocol pretty easy to push through and done i've removed this location from their system we're safe here lz secure look at that boy coming in [Music] oh that looks good it's a glitch okay i don't want to do it if it's a glitch gondor thank you for the five [Music] faster faster faster oh solid ground [Music] please tell me we can go did you find the weapon you were looking for can we go [Laughter] [Music] this is all her fault it isn't cortana tell him but it's classified permission granted i was created by dr catherine halsey to mimic this installation security to trap cortana for deletion i was successful cortana's no longer a threat and now she's going to help us stop the banished of course she is i think i'm with you i didn't even know what a banished was an hour ago me neither you can see the odds aren't great yes yes you should listen to her you're gonna get us all killed oh this is fascinating you're trying to survive but i was programmed to die really one person with a death wish wasn't enough no i was just figuring what i'm supposed to wait i'm picking up a unsc distress signal location the source is four kilometers from here oh look at this the distress signal's point of origin the tower this is our current location this was until two minutes ago a banished forward operating base i say was because now it's ours yay chief what is she talking about now here's the cool part there are more unsc forward operating bases that have fallen into banished hands well paws they have paws each one is associated with a territory here is the location of the unsc signal i've been tracking and here are two more fobs market let's go let's go what there [Music] the cutscenes must be mocaps right mongoose well i can spawn a vehicle i want my battle rifle please [Music] yes [Music] [Music] that's beautiful isn't it son [Music] i have a question i was created to lock down cortana but i don't know why what did she do that was so wrong she was our target i understand that but is this classified because i don't have all the information this is insane i see vanished everywhere did you hear me everywhere what intel did dr halsey give you before your mission halsey only tells people what they need to know fly a pelican straight into enemy territory no one will ever notice great idea big guy i still don't understand why you had to delete her it feels like something's missing guess what they noticed they all noticed and we've got a bad instructor up ahead armored very heavily armored it'll have to wait i suppose how close can you get us how close we are and you're asking me how close put us down here here we're still doing this hope this works because it's as good as it's gonna get it's close enough [Music] it better be i'm getting out of here right back into the action there's a little creature there look at that the hell we're close to the unsc signals origin source unclear there's just too much chatter on all banished channels i keep hearing the tower it's probably the main structure we saw as we flew in it's massive look down there we're close to the fob we detected you take out those monsters get me to that terminal and i'll show what i can do no problem weapon what was what supposed to be i didn't do nothing you could see me from there [Applause] he's my favorite [Music] it's just those halo 3 vibes you know i can't not love it let me see is it connected that's right all i need to do is chat with the bandage security protocol and by chat i mean push it out of the way because it is really not smart and there we now have ourselves a second fob was that you might fast travel there between these so what you're going to just rebuild the unsc piece by piece that's his call i'm just trying to be helpful speaking of which each fob seems to be linked to the battle net and if i do this we can piece together what the banished are up to for instance over here is some kind of banished outpost branson keep unclear but it's well defended so it's definitely worth looking into and blowing up you can do that here is what i can only describe as someone at the banished value highly these are the targets noted his bio is interesting if you want to see for yourself it's waiting for you in the database they're tracking unsc transponders too caches containing valuable equipment and intel oh no it looks like there are multiple unsc squads engaged in trying to survive what are they doing here oh no options side missions main missions okay i don't have any spartan cause do i so i could just call in a mongoose can i i presume i can do that is that target okro vagadon jewel this energy sword that sounds scary are you ready chief what do you think i already told you that the odds aren't great for them i've got guns here today let's go find out what that signal is where'd you get that mongoose from sidekick okay so they're just weapon spawns cool pretty happy with my loadout right now i assume i'll be able to call in tanks at some point right warthogs pelicans all sorts [Music] this is the place you wanted me to blow up we're coming up on that outpost we learned about at the fob looks like some kind of salvage operation what's our move shut it down i just gotta blow these up it's simple i'm master chief i can do anything one two three four there's something over there as well [Music] [Music] so what are you going to do about it oh yes nice you need to manually raise each silo first and how would i manually raise the silos with that silos raised now kill god am i too close to that okay one of four done fob stands for feet over brains i don't know if that's true but i like the idea of that feet over brains isn't it forward operating base there's a rocket launcher there guys look at that i just eat this at it [Music] is rocket launcher love that yes i don't want to attract too many enemies at once you know because i'll end up dying [Music] oh my game did a little freezer saving checkpoint that'll do you guys are giving me hints his name is a scorpion [Music] what are these weird looking things destroy that silo jesus strange isn't it it's like a really fast jackal with armor or something one cosmonaut does it yeah there's a tank in there how do i get in there then on the roof oh i'm stuck i don't want to be killed by that this is where i should save that rocket launcher isn't it did i hit him then [Music] it's all locked up i appreciate the zoom you know right here this is the last one i think maybe if i destroy that it's going to open up the door there we've got company chief well more company it looks like the banished are tearing down and repairing vehicles here not for long marking the repair bays let's do this oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] kill me i've got the energy sword just in case we might need it okay so they don't blow up straight away but you can use them to kind of leak explosives he's a big mud this guy's bullying me okay you're gonna get the special treatment buddy i'm afraid there it is i was absolutely sick of you give me a break they're stripping unsc hardware to repair excavation equipment are they banished digging for something oh no they're always digging for something but what is there anything up here [Music] i love the energy sword awesome soundtrack as well man's great why did they they just landed right in front of me in a tank come on oh good idea is it there's another repair bay over here how deep can you really dig on a rock floating in space you know that's a really good point [Music] hmm i'm going to get on this one just a little grunt out here [Music] odst music was great yeah [Music] i didn't see a way in unless there was a way that i could like destroy the shield but that thing there what's that oh okay here we go that's cheeky new little mechanic there i like that [Music] [Music] [Music] ransom keep is officially offline we did it steve well you did it we did it together weapon excuse me sir think about your actions it's really rude i mean you give me a tank is it stuck oh no wait i'm just in the driver's seat i thought i got it stuck then i always get vehicles stuck in games i was like surely not already not like this i've already got the scorpion stuff it's kind of weird on pc driving this okay so go over to the signal now that's a cool little side mission there on i'm facing the wrong way aren't i you want the front armor at the front with the tank obviously there we go uh mint thank you for becoming a member oh there's birds do you hear that it's coming from that communication tower really okay hello i can help with that so if i take this we can then use it as a fast travel location and also a location to spawn vehicles i assume it's cool little mechanic all right we've got the rear but it's fine sometimes rear facing forward can work right i think that's all of them get me to that terminal and fob foxtrot is ours that one was good nice and easy [Applause] [Music] another fob in unsc control and in the shadow of that vanish tower the closer we get to it the stronger the unsc distress signal becomes the source has to be inside okay so we've got fast travel online now as well lz confirmed ready to deploy on your order chief i don't need any i've got a tank oh hello where'd you come from seriously where did you come from i don't remember seeing you we're gonna be just fine don't worry yeah you have to use the mouse at the same time it makes much more sense on a controller vehicles in halo you can't get used to it though but it's just a bit weird now that's the big tower there isn't it can i get down here without flipping the tank usually in halo you can flip the vehicle anyway nice need a bit more speed here you would think with it being a tank it would have a bit more traction here i love that they just give you this so early in the game though there you go he's a scorpion you go have fun in the open world oh no that's not good they print marines in this universe 3d printers are they synthetics what are they we're going to need to find a way in excuse me where's that coming from i could hear you up there okay so i don't think i can take the tank up here guys i'm sorry i might have to leave it [Music] over there someone chewing at me right boots on the ground let's go i could grapple up there if i wanted to hello i mean it's a long way up isn't it really let's charge you like crazy a skewer i'm gonna keep the energy sword it's cooler although bulldog one shot yeah headshots are massive in this game i don't suppose there's fall damage though you oh you're kidding me because i looked down it didn't mantle me upwards theory me i just wanted to give you guys a nice cinematic view of the chasm you know i think it looked cool do that one instead nice [Music] i'm gonna kill you i love the combat in this it's so good really fun [Music] he just smacked me and it blew the shot coil up classic good names it's right kind of at the top [Music] do not fight enemies while holding shot calls you have one ammo luckily look at this that's actually perfect did you think i would let you walk right into my tower my tower my tower i think not my facility you'll be the one dying he seems confident yes he does but fortunately it's misplaced when the lockdown triggered there was a power spike in what i presume was a security building i've marked it on the map this is it let's find a way in oh i'm right on top of it shirts shotgun and the lockdown the lockdown protocol should be simple to reverse let me see three two one done oh what is it does it sound good this this place is an interrogation facility run by our elite friend back there check luck it's always nice always dice not good chuck lock neither is mine i think chief's got a pretty good reputation let's be honest come on i'm sleeping i'm on the head you're going to need to manually activate the gravity lift i've marked it on your map this location acts as a holding facility prisoners are captured funneled through the flock and then on to somewhere they call the house of reckoning which is suitably ominous and banished sounding quite ominous the house of reckoning you guys remember the house of the dead games house of the dead just as i thought you know this just reminded me actually there was a um there was a game called typing of the dead which was house of the dead but instead of a girl when the zombies appeared in front of you and all the bosses and monsters you had to type words and it was a really good way of practicing touch typing [Music] that must be a way in not [Music] activating the gravity lift it's over here he wants to fight oh there's prisoners excuse me where did you come from do i just shoot that they're free marines help [Music] sorry the plasma wait the plasma sword didn't work on his armor that was weird plasma sword was always like a catch-all right and you just can't use it now on certain enemies marines are really helpful okay adam thank you it's good to know so i should always free them i mean it seems quite simple doesn't it get rid of that problem he just threw a um that was cool the brute actually threw a thing at me but they do the same as well [Music] [Music] oh can i i'd like that please thank you very much i hope you don't mind me just taking off you it's their version of kevlar okay in chief more spartan armor and the source of the distress signal we're too late another call a deployable threat sensor it appears to lock onto and highlight any targets in range could be useful they throw grunts at you as well damn this armor belonged to a spartan named hudson griffin rest in peace suggest he was alive when the armor was removed forcibly yeah painful it's a long shot but he might still be alive interesting pressure equivalent so i can cycle through these now [Music] you've got no chill [Music] [Music] demon choice for an elite who specializes in torture [Music] cool lighting again [Music] no i'm going to keep the rocket launcher i'm going to save it for the elite if that's a good call chat think i should do [Music] i feel like i should save it [Music] oh there's a lamp cool thank you and expose your weaknesses cheeky spawn cool yeah [Music] i can upgrade something else now [Music] so my grapple now stuns as well that's cool [Music] [Music] there's a lot of kineticism to the guns you know i feel good this game must feel awesome on a controller [Music] hard light weapon required [Music] are they torturing this poor man what's happening here that elite is just the master torturer oh no spartan griffin he's still alive oh they've got him in some oh that reminds me of metal gear solid you know when you're being tortured and you have to spam welcome to my tower master chief i'm gonna have to use the finger on i will be broken see where he is it is where you will give up your secrets the wall's retracted watch your back he could come from anywhere not gonna reveal him [Music] [Music] shots [Music] [Music] easy there's a special energy sword or something we need to get him out of that machine oh my god shut this thing down working on it there's permanent pain that's horrible be ready i'm going to cut him loose you you're alive he's not looking great the baddest i tried to stop them i tried to easy you're safe now the bandits they they have something they call the conservatory that's all i know it's picked up north of here dig site i couldn't stop them but you can my favorite song of the soundtrack this consider it done that's good good the others the sperms did you i'll find them echo 216 all channels can you hear me i repeat can you hear me [Music] chief big guy your motion tracker isn't moving ah come on come on give me anything jeez i respond please did you find the source of the signal whoever's down there either has to come with us or be left behind can you hear me a dig site on the ring this conservatory must be some sort of forerunner installation what do you suppose they're after it's time to go [Music] and that's the tower i'm guessing that whatever the conservatory is the banished won't want us anywhere near it then they'll be disappointed yes they will wow 2100 mias it's fine weird noises lovely warhawk there [Music] oh it sounds good i wish you could drive these in first person [Music] [Music] i'm gonna eat my eyes the banished are searching for something called the conservatory let me guess you're heading there too affirmative well don't worry about me multiple unsc signatures in that vanished stronghold chief i think we've got some friendlies inside [Laughter] forgive me master chief would never say that and look hello what's this there's a ghost in it don't you dare i'm gonna drop some elites on me aren't you oh that guy's so tanky what the hell no more hostiles bob echoes ready to be brought back into the fold excellent i just yeeted myself in here with the warhog so stupid encryption [Applause] that'll do it bob captured looks like we're right on the edge of the island a chunk of what used to be a single contiguous structure can you imagine the force it would take to blow this ring apart must have been quite a show big big earthquake or something maybe oh cool razorback mongoose warthog that's all i've got at the armored hog on the moment is there a yes okay you're gonna be my gunner you nearly got killed dude i can use this yeah thanks yeah i can use this yeah excuse me okay right this is the new one isn't it never thought

they're not coming guys the ais is smart enough to make its way down the mountain [Music] oh you do go over there control wall ride grind chief manual have you found what your banished outpost up ahead and there's a lot of banished inside whatever's going on in there it's high priority the forge of teach should i go in here i feel like i should do this well there's a lot of things though hey it's a maintenance depot i'm picking up a number of repair bays and fuel silos take them out and we'll bring this outpost to its knees oh no kind of wish that you had a stealthy option but you don't do i mean you can like creep up behind them and melee them usually a one-hit kill oh man that's such a good upgrade isn't it you guys were right about the grapple hook stupid ghosts let's go this way guys on a turret over there okay that's really annoying me now that's more like it i'm really digging this game it's just a nice like halo sandbox that's just a fun game right there [Music] play this area and then we'll start rising some of these calls out the ground okay one here i think you can grapple the ghost canyon okay i didn't know that i'm gonna end you today [Music] [Music] what's in here then need to destroy this i could hear something purring then you guys hear that shut it down i didn't even realize that i had the flashlight on guys thank you for reminding me maintaining some heavy excavation equipment just like that other outpost ow [Music] oh no i'm an idiot i'm gonna kill myself never mind these brutes the master chief has killed himself nobody expected this shoot me from a long way there this place is massive isn't it oh come on marines you're free friendly i don't want to bring him over what are you doing you're going to end up getting killed you stunned by me oh hang on lance look at this drive me let's go whoa that's it's gonna horrible [Music] [Music] i need to get rid of that sorry up there it's annoying the hell out of me you could just not stand in front of me how about that hmm i think he's dead guys we got him we got him finally he was really annoying [Music] a couple more to go let's do it [Music] go back on it just be gone i'm sick of it i can't use that tank can i huh [Music] more marines here 117 in the freaking flesh you got them right do i get in this one nothing on the top what am i missing here chat i can't shoot through that there's something under the ground how do i get down there tunnel system that's cool [Applause] are you giving me this for [Music] i would have thought one purple thing could have done it you know trying not to injure myself this time [Music] we just did a ring of rosie there you see that hey stop it where where are you oh i've ruined myself again yeah [Music] it looks like i said i wouldn't do good [Music] i'm the first time that we've gone under the ground there isn't it [Music] okay i think that's this section clear now okay oh we just missed a bit too high [Applause] big area [Music] it's a cabal i mean from destiny [Music] that's a wrap on the repair bays now for the fuel styling okay so that's the difficult part done a couple more fuel rods silos here stay there over here guys leave that marine alone no he killed him [Music] i'm stuck no one died i don't want to die [Music] up here i mean a bit of breathing room here [Music] how'd you go is the big guy dead [Music] did i get the big guy he the big guy [Music] [Music] okay last one oh that was good nice little side mission there i enjoyed that nice work we're two for two on maintenance depots whatever the banished are after with this equipment their job just got a lot harder i bet it did 100 valor unveiled to unlock weapons vehicles okay right we need to go over there oh god it's another big guy good it's rude no tank though is there i was expecting attack guys i was expecting a tank well they released this on playstation i don't think so i don't think halo will ever come out on playstation so how do i get to this then can i go around this way like that attacks are just being built aren't they really back in the war hog [Music] i love i love getting in this little hole here don't [Music] [Music] open this up [Music] tank traps halo tank traps eh that's better it's got gun i can use and drive at the same time up and over jack yeah but i couldn't go up and over in the warthog could i [Music] we just picked up a unsc distress signal the signature suggests a squad of marines alive no response on comms but if they are it's a sure bet they need our help let's find i them shot the bird sorry boyd oh okay banished propaganda tower you weaken the banished influence on the unsa but these are just little towers that you can drive around and explode takes one to no one that banished facility up ahead looks like a mining operation that must be the dig site the spartan was talking about you made it there's nobody here why is there nobody home what are the banished doing here they are doing exactly what they've been doing since they guys a sniper rifle yes how could they they're ruining this place and for what i don't think they care to win it's kind of quiet isn't it kind of orange there that tunnel the banished must already be down below i can't take the ghost down though this should be impossible for runner alloy is almost indestructible what do you think they chief it's a giant laser that's what they're using to mine isn't it i guess we need to deal with that mining laser oh and these guys well something's not crosstalk it's controlled up in the central structure this is a different vowel rifle what do i do pole position i've got this is it interesting i think this is a unique valve rifle watch out for the beam he looked like he was waddling that didn't he as if he needed the toilet there's beavers i've not seen any beavers halo beaver i don't remember that in the marketing for the game hi boys i'm not using a sniper here hello [Music] it happens when you trigger that cut scene in a vehicle okay [Applause] so it isn't a unique power rifle it just looks cool i'm so sorry they held my hand against the surface it was so cold it burned i screamed for them to stop but then but then it began to open slowly pieces moved slid open and then i saw her just give me a sec something's wrong i can't shut it down then we destroy it way ahead of you there are two power regulators down there all we need to do is manually expose each regulator's cooling pylon to trigger a cascade effect and by we i mean you and do i know tea bag yeah i've heard a teabag it makes cool videos [Music] it doesn't sound chief good returned but strangely it does not main demons [Applause] [Applause] i could not have wished for a more world [Applause] i mean he tried to kill me he did say that i'd be the last thing that he ever saw [Applause] it's down here isn't it that switch should open up the regulator [Music] the careful a lot of bad guys here [Music] stupid turret again the main in my existence oh that's a wrong burn guys i'm being assaulted from every direction here i don't like this [Music] sorry what is this the scrap cannon [Music] i like this let's get some health back though otherwise i'm ruined the turret [Music] oh that sounds amazing [Music] but the audio design on this game is like 10 out of 10 for me so good the god gun halo infinite has a new guard gun yes i agree can i get a tank here guys only there was a nice little tank i don't think there is this thing's okay but it's just a bit weird in it i've not seen that scrap cannon in multiplayer hello hmg he's just giving you all the things isn't it yeah okay i'm gonna use this this is gonna be fun i've got 85 left in this here we go does it look gorgeous on pc yeah it does great looking game i'm playing it maxed out here okay here we go wheelie boy yes it is [Music] [Music] get away from me i need a rocket launcher how about my own slime arrival mate it's better than yours [Music] i'm out of ammo guys [Music] god you're annoying [Music] [Music] pick this up long range combat now a little bit some weapons in here the forge leaks or something has there been some stuff leaked about forge i imagine they're gonna make it crazy for this game right because i seem to remember that with halo infinite like the original plan or when they revealed it for the first time it was like we want halo wings from it to last for like 10 years or something like if that's the case then forge could be nuts just about to kill for the me where'd you go you're dead okay pulse cannon i'll do oh we gotta get back up the top now take this elevator there we go [Music] shut this drill down [Music] hello i see him okay [Music] i don't want to be next to him i have not got good guns for this fight okay so this guy's interesting [Music] bed you are doing well no oh so funny what the hell can't believe the needler came in clutch never expected that could use that could throw that at him that was funny oh god that was good you've done your part now for mine you don't have knuckles to crack you can't do that that doesn't make sense is there a problem of course not [Music] oh she nailed it it's down there cheese modified very recently to cut into the ring modified for your hammer now by who definitely not by bassists back there formula is very sophisticated like all these little mini bosses change but they didn't just modify the forerunner architecture they improved it oh and there are a lot of banished in the conservatory good they've been down there for days good we are walking into another trap don't worry i've got this and you left that till last are you scared no you of course not i've got you to keep me alive master chief is never scared look at the titanium alloy wrapped around our neural interface i'll be fine look at this guy good too who would be scared off you can carry that thing quite molten down here isn't it oh don't drop down there i'm not sure i should have this but i'm gonna lean into it when life gives you lemons make lemonade no ah the game denied me the hardest part in legendary are the jackal snipers i can imagine yeah welcome to the conservatory i wonder what the banished are looking for down here pokemon find out another spartan get me close that's a cool helmet is it the eva helmet or something it's called remember that it's got a unique look to it a drop wall module deployable cover resilient but temporary all these poland spawns this is spartan vadrana makkovitch armor's been offline for 13 days cause of death is what an enhanced energy blade same as spartan stone pattern emerging chief who's doing this we're going to find out drop all that's useless in multiplayer but i think in single player probably could be really good i don't have a good loadout right now paul's car man three's my drop wall i think it's just fine i can shoot through it they have to break it i mean it doesn't seem fair grave hamlet had a sick kill streak with the grab hammer the other day it was kind of like that actually [Music] gonna kill yourself let's get violent get violent look at you you couldn't hurt a fly this is disgrace from any range [Applause] i think i need this [Music] flightless no i can get what i wanted there we go simple yeah i think there will be single-player dlc as well i hope so then [Music] did that one just say work smarter not harder the grunts are actually quite funny i know it's a bit it's a bit cliche but they are actually quite funny they've done a good job with them because it could be at that point where it's just annoying right or just not funny at all [Music] death [Music] i think they've written them quite well yeah the gunplay is really nice spencer hope you guys are enjoying the stream if you are do consider hitting the like as well uh we will be doing a full walkthrough of this game for let's play i don't know how far we'll get tonight but i'll definitely be continuing this because i'm having a lot of fun with it i think it's quite a good game to stream as well because it's kind of fun right like you do all sorts of crazy stuff runs really nicely too oh hmm like a fish i've got some power seeds over here great stream so far thank you chris playing on pc marco pc ultra 4k60 should look really good as well on the stream it needs more power find another one it needs a bit more juice [Music] uh i thought you were dead there's one here yeah justin fix the pc now not crashing anymore and it's open come on let's go before they get really creative wait do you hear that it's coming from it's banging or something we should help her maybe no she's correct i request your assistance who are you what's your name i'm despondent of this installation and this is my conservatory my conservatory this is not right oh no [Music] the hell's up let's go where down there what was my issue it's the gpu what were those flying things no it was related to the voltage in the boost clocks and despondent pyre no potentially dangerous they're always dangerous gee you can be optimistic strength [Music] why that did you [Music] overkill [Music] this is so good this gun the bulldog love it it's brilliant blue isn't it [Applause] [Music] three shots then it's [Music] oh you're scared of me sassy chief is great yeah yes don't really get much sass from chief in the older halo games 1v1 mid lane i feel like there's a 1v1 here looks like a 1v1 i knew it i could feel it i was going to get rushed in i knew it knew that was coming we're getting close to the bottom wait listen please [Music] manga is nasty multiplayer yeah it is it's really good you need the mangler melee combo in multiplayer looks great uh [Applause] you're a big can't hit him guy this yes i'm another pistol for ages look at it it's so good just it is just the best gun in the game they shot that mid-air then didn't they damn [Applause] big guy got me wait listen please do not do this [Music] didn't expect that i know there's a big guy here oh i'm under fire [Music] horrible i will nearly kill me [Music] did i miss the uh human weapons then just in a different spot what the needle he's here isn't he i mean that was a lot easier than last time big boy rocking no wonder he killed me he had a bloody rocket launcher i know this ring must not be compromised and here's something walking around something big thank you darren [Music] we i don't know i'm so attached to this what is this thing on about though the despondent pyre where they come up with these names they just have a big list of weird words and then pick two hello oh no we're too late something awful happened here plug me in we'll figure this out this is a bit sus isn't it i thought that was a turret in front of me there but it's a weird you know what i want i do cortana that's cortana it has not been changed this installations weapons may be yours but its secrets are not is protected the containment facility in particular containment the flood why would i you and i both know that there are worse things than the flood within this ring no there's no way you could know say you've come for me at last why are you doing this john why don't you understand the seal must not be broken the punished cannot be freed this can never be negotiated there is no other choice reconsider the consequences of your request back to your conservatory monitor what does that mean what could be worse than the flood nothing good i'm sure we're about to find out find us a way out on it new enemies hello there's a lot of these more of them chief remember when you said new and dangerous shock rifle hello you were right sassy chief is back longer than i thought something is taking control of local systems well i was also considering flying octopus monkeys skimmers it is then i don't think flying octopus monkeys this gun is perfect though because it looks like it changed onto them it's a nice move a single shot wow i'm gonna use that [Applause] hostile reinforcements inbound i mean hasn't the whole thing been hostile reinforcements so far the code is being rewritten altered using a forerunner routine chief enemy reinforcements yes i'm not aware it's got a scope on it that's cool [Music] i'm done come get me sentinel beam i didn't see one is this cinder shot we gotta go this way yeah this will be a video afterwards whole thing what happened back there when i interfaced with the cradle it unlocked something something important cortana was here six months ago i could feel what she felt when you arrived it was joy fear and pain we've got a strange relationship me and katana is something big went down in here spartans don't go quietly i've noticed it's like that hallway in metal gear solid the roster now then who are you what's the name of the ninja the deep dog complete spartan theodore sorel special weapons expert died 13 days ago like makovich the assassin brutes grateful more than one can't remember whoever they are they're proficient well trained we've got a score to settle now i've got a thruster as well okay sentinel beam looks like a caterpillar i presume the flood will show up i imagine they will as well chief that platform we're too late not yet it was great i ran out of ammo very quickly there didn't i oh got mortar oh okay five one it doesn't seem to be doing much damage to this thing i almost died there because that gun they were persistent did they kill spartan sorrell not hunters negative his killers are still active the plasma motor yeah i can charge it up can't i hey railguns this elevator it's taking us back to the surface it doesn't make sense why come all the way down here just to kill the monitor the monitor's purpose is to protect the ring so why kill her no idea oh interesting we're going back up to the top now you died five times there on legendary ouch i mean i barely survived on normal show yourself i know you have been following me we are not enemies despondent pyre she had something i required but hear this you are not the future you okay chief i'm trying to get the armor unlocked try harder the forerunners lies are at an end i am the harbinger of the truth the endless will be found they will ascend now would be good i know i know three the reformation begins two one go so oh she's unusual [Music] [Music] [Music] i took too long you could have been killed it's okay you saved us both that structure yeah you know what it is no the harbinger said the endless will be found maybe they're inside that thing only one way to find out [Music] i really wanted that ghost what the hell is it engage is it someone made a real one didn't they oh my god nice [Music] nice please yeah someone made a real one of these that actually works and you can drive it so cool they were driving it around hollywood i remember seeing some promo videos for it i think it was a youtube channel actually that did it that works oh we got some hunters okay hunters and what do they do don't answer that just get rid of them so i can get us in i hate these so much there's a sniper looking at me as well i'm outside oh good [Music] damn to get in we need to activate the gravlets you can't use their guns [Music] one of them died a lot easier than the other one there hmm the protocol is not banished in origin it's sturdier than i expected what is it problem no problem no problem i could write this jigsaw thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly teabag him no i forgot to teabag i'm sorry i'll let you down that's a weird effect [Music] that went from north to 100 real fast yeah it did i think we're going in here are they still squishy from behind i think so josh yeah hunters always well aren't they they've got that little bit in the back a red bit where are we going we're in wow this place wow exactly what you'd expect what does it do unknown find me stuff there we go plug me in over there interesting this structure has been activated using a protocol that's far older than anything i've ever seen it it knows we're here welcome welcome oh hello i am adjutant resolution another one monitor of this installation loyal servants of despond empire who must be indisposed if i have been activated have you seen her kind of quite big that one do you want to tell him tell me what the monitor is gone go gone but it wasn't us are you sure of course it wasn't us good good good i was worried you were perhaps unfriendly as you can see this fire has been successfully deployed this way i presume you wish to see the observation platform please i've heard it's a great view from up there see he seems friendly we'll see did you say something no there is much to see just talking to myself wait he just stares at me spider chief this reminds me so much of the first halo all these textures and materials they've nailed the aesthetic portal okay that's weird did i just leave the original version of myself behind there ship a thesis and all yes i'll that one moment i can't fly like you mate let us proceed this is very exciting soon the sequence will be sent and the reformation can be given [Music] [Music] where did he go long loading time here big level maybe josh they definitely nailed the classic halo aesthetic but made it look next-gen at the same time yeah i thought it was loading as you can see we are ready to progress as soon as please excuse me get me to that terminal he's not gonna be happy weapon [Music] oh that's not so bad the structure's purpose is simple rebuild the ring well more specifically create the materials needed to repair it not gonna happen why it's such a beautiful oh the banished sorry i was distracted first you have to destroy a weapon there's so much to learn here shut it down permanently [Music] what are you doing this is not acceptable you were supposed to be oh my god he's a little mac oh ok explosives i feel like i should pick up that a wave eat it [Music] that's not very effective is it [Music] does it even have a weak spot i don't know about this honestly be reasonable about it look at that [Music] beam energy i didn't think he was gonna come round [Music] there we go [Music] he's only got one left [Music] this is excuse me sir that was rude [Music] yeah i wasn't doing much damage just shooting him in the face my natural instinct though go for the head shot sometimes it doesn't work in single-player games in multiplayer you just go over the headshot you get max damage you know i have good news and bad news how many okay straight to the bad news a lot i count nine no ten spires more being deployed all the time active no not yet at least they appear to be waiting for an initialization sequence something is flooding the network trying to start it but there's resistance why the protocol that triggered all this wasn't exactly correct it worked well it started the process there's more bad news i can't shut it down exactly but i can remove it from the network of course i can find the source of the attack i just need to wait is it safe come on it's me an infiltration program designed oh no oops i think she knows i'm how are you doing disconnect give me one second get it now it's done why don't you trust me what was that maybe taking it offline wasn't such a great idea we need to go like now immediate extraction my location now i'm coming i'm coming [Music] open up go [Music] that was sick upload those fire locations all of them all of them coordinates received um it looks like someone has marked 42 new locations which would be crazy right this one it was the source of the attack attack what's she talking about chief is everyone trying to kill you it kind of seems like it oh wait you're being sarcastic he's fun i like him am i dead i must be i mean this is a punishment right yep [Music] this isn't happening i'm going to have to make an emergency landing [Music] these cutscenes are amazing man no no you i can't stand who you are breathe no you don't get to tell me what to do you don't get to tell me anything are you even listening i count three anti-aircraft cannons three what you'll be safe here oh i'll be safe safe i haven't been safe since i found you i found you remember you're out there on your own and you'd still be out if it wasn't for me i thought i was going home there won't be a home if we don't stop the banished you keep saying that we're outgoing outnumbered i know i saw condors over there i'm going to dig through them and find one with the working sleep space drive and when you're done with this war we'll get away from here far away wait here oh please let me see what i can find canon's first when i get back we can look together okay i like him he's a good character this is the e3 demo isn't
