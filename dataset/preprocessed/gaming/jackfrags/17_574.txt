hello everyone hope you're all doing well today i've got some more cod warzone for you it's been a difficult week a difficult few days for me with warzone and we'll get onto that shortly but first can i just say how awesome these summer trials have been in the game we talked about the first two in the last war zone video which were the risky parkour and the gun trial but they've added the last three and i really liked all of them i thought they were great this one is a bit free-form you have 40 targets and you can choose what weapons you want you've got to get below 30 seconds to get the gold so i spent a couple of tries figuring out what i thought the best route might be for this one and eventually i reckon i nailed it i went for two pistols speed and accuracy the most important things here and obviously a bigger weapon is going to slow you down i think i could have shaved maybe 1.5 seconds off this time but this was my personal best after i stopped trying 19.5 seconds and because of my accuracy i actually knocked 5.1 seconds and that's my best time for that one this one was the marksman challenge with the sniper rifle i reckon i had the most difficulty with this one so you can start with the sniper and you've got to shoot all the targets as quick as you can i don't think accuracy matters as much on this one but because i'm going for speed i actually start the first round with the pistol but then you've got to switch to the hdr because it really opens up in the distance gets way longer so obviously you want to try and go for collaterals as much as possible don't miss any shots because that's added time you don't want to have to reload during one of the waves so wave two done there wave three hit the collateral hit the second collateral third collateral and now i can just go off and pick off the targets one by one because i know that i don't have to reload as long as i don't miss but these blue targets are kind of hard to hit because they speed up and slow down so those were the ones that i was having the most difficulty with final round though you can open up with a collat i want to get that stupid blue one out the way first hit another collat there you can actually line up the top red and blue ones they do overlap at one point and i was waiting for it but i thought you know what this is a decent time let's just finish it off and that was the goal that i got and i tried this one so many times i was like you know what i'm not going to try and get a better personal best than that so i left it on that so four four four seven was my best time for that one and the final one is this one which is really fun enjoyed this so much targets pop up really quickly in front of you but they were also civilians and if you shoot the civilians you lose points when i think you lose your combo also headshots give you more points so it's quite challenging it's really fun though you just get zoned into this one it's one of those ones where i just start it my hand is like gripped on the mouse really tight and my face is glued to the monitor and you just get in the zone just one by one trying to hit as many as you can as quickly as possible and target acquisition is super important because you don't want to shoot any of the civilians because that will hamper your score but that's the gist of it and i skipped ahead of it there but this is coming towards the end of my best run and i managed to get a 92 combo i do wonder how long you could keep this going for what's the world record for this one that was my top score on this 11 400. you only need six for the gold so that's more than double but i'd love to see someone who's really good have a crack on that but let me know what your best times were down in the comments and if you get gold on all of these you get this growl skin as far as i know that's the only way to get it as well also there is a country v country element to this too and as of today one day 18 hours left when i recorded this germany are leading followed by israel and then france unfortunately for the uk we are all the way down in eighth but go canada and usa man yeah japan and russia they're in fifth and fourth looking good but this has been really fun if they could just do this every week that'd be great i love these challenges they're really addictive i thought i should show you this too if you remember the pawn takes porn website that was part of the cold war reveal easter egg that arg well it's been updated a few times and now there are multiple screens so you can click across and it will load another scene there's a rubber duck timer counting down a safe an old dot matrix printer and a pc and you can click on the pc and if you type zork and press enter it actually loads up a choose your own adventure game like an old school game it's really cool and there's so many things you can do on this it gives you instructions you can take things from the game for example you have an inventory you can give directions and it was discovered that if you keep playing this game you get achievements and then you can create an account and you could also put your address in to receive something and over the past couple of days the people who were attempting to decipher this have been sent weird photos in the mail and when you put them together it makes a map of the game and from that they figured out a qr code that took them to pawntakespawn.com invisibletruths and there is a box which asks you to input six different keys and these keys were found by playing the adventure game and you have to enter them like this so the top left one is fugazi file the one next to that is info hacks and then underneath fugazi file we've got burn bag and then across from that we've got shred it all and then bottom left is intel fire and then the final one is grid square like that and if you click submit you'll get an achievement and it says under the cloak of darkness the pieces make their way across the board forces toppled positions claimed another mission completed another pawn down and these look like they could be perks in cold war like that could be ninja for example that could be a vsat or something like that so we'll see you soon but if you go to your achievements you can then click here to claim your reward it gives you a code if you then take that code and go to call of duty.com redeem enter your code in there click submit and it unlocks a super secret skin for the truck in the game and it looks very soviet union cold war obviously a lot of people contributed to figuring this out but i believe that it was geeky pastimes and his discord that did the main body of work here so congratulations to him and the guys over there now if you played warzone last night or anytime today you may have noticed something missing the vehicles yes there are no vehicles in the game at the moment a hotfix was released last night to remove all vehicles and if you've not kept up to date with things you might be thinking why i love my vehicles flying around in a helicopter going around on a quadi attack rover whatever it might be well yesterday a pretty nasty glitch was shared around social media where if you got in a vehicle i went to a specific point on the map which was just out of bounds it would crash the entire server and kick everyone out back to the lobby and this is something that anyone could do if you knew where to go get a vehicle go there you could crash the lobby i was playing last night and this happened three times in a row and then i just gave up and went to bed and thought you know what until they fix this i don't think it's a good idea to play but a few hours ago they did release a hotfix which removed those vehicles and this is how it looks like when it would happen so for now it is fixed in the fact that you can't crash the game anymore but of course there were no vehicles and vehicles were really important integral part of warzone so actually fixing this and being able to put vehicles back in i think it might be a bit of a tricky one because this is something to do with map geometry and i have limited knowledge of game design but from what i know most game engines if you want to change something with the map you have to change that thing and then rebuild it and then seed the new version to all the different clients so i'm guessing that soon there may be another big patch for everyone to download because if you think about the size of the warzone map it's a big map with a lot of geometry and unless they have some kind of special tech in their engine i don't see a way that they could just change that one part and it'd be okay but who knows maybe they will i'm expecting another big patch i don't know when they will do that but fingers crossed it comes soon because i think a lot of us like the vehicles really so moving on you may have noticed a couple new things in the store if you haven't been able to pick up a ghillie suit yet then how about this one this is the 420 blazer ghillie suit you can really blend in and maybe chill out at the same time also maracatius they must be a fan favorite surely but if you do pick anything up from the store including black ops cold war using my creator code is a great way to support me at the bottom there you can click on supporter creator and put in jackfrags in capital letters and basically that means that i'll just get a bit of kickback from whatever you buy it's a nice way to help support what i do here and a big thanks to all of these guys that use my creator code i did ask in a previous video if you use it tweet me a picture and i'll feature you guys in a video i have about 100 screenshots saved at the moment but please keep sending them in this is just some of them but i will do my utmost best to keep putting you guys in the vids so thank you so much honestly means the world to me and i feel very lucky to be involved with this okay then so as i mentioned at the start of the video i've had a bit of a rough week with warzone this week you guys know i love to play solo matches on warzone it's a place where i can get my own headspace and really focus up for a while i haven't played trios or quads for a few days either just because i've been so focused on solos and i always like to try and get a win and record that and then talk about the tactics that i'm using whether i did it with live commentary or whether i'm adding commentary after the fact and being a bit more analytical but the last couple days i've been playing quite a lot of solos and because of skill based matchmaking every single match is really hyper competitive especially for solos almost every player that you come up against is a good player so there's a lot of close gun fights most of the players they're using meta weapons and bills in their loadouts as well yeah it's really fun and satisfying when you do eventually manage to win a solo game especially when it's so competitive but i have to be honest it does get draining at times when most people in the lobby are playing like a tournament but it's not actually a tournament there's nothing at stake here there's no ranking system in the game anything like that you're just trying to add another win to your leaderboard i suppose and that does take a lot of the fun out of it for me but i don't see that changing so it is what it is a game like warzone to me it's supposed to be played for fun and every now and again you want to have a nice casual game where you can relax and test things have a bit of fun with your mates but whether the game's been set up and the fact that everyone knows everything about it now i don't think that's a possibility anymore that's a bit of a shame maybe it would change for a couple weeks if they bought our new map we'll have to wait and see so i've been trying to get a win using the galil which i don't think is a meta weapon at the moment but i thought to myself well i've made a decent build here let's see if we can get a win with it and in reality after using it for a while i don't think it can compete with the m4 with the kilo or with the mp5 up close it's a fun gun to you sure but the amount of times that i was just getting ttk'ed by better weapons started to get a bit frustrating for me so i played for around four hours yesterday and in those four hours i got three second places i've got a load of top tens and recently i always seem to get a load of kills but i'm losing those last couple of gunfights and i reckon that's probably down to the gallow but i was insistent on trying to get a win it didn't happen i think another problem that i have is that my playstyle i like to move around a lot i can't sit in one place i get so impatient i like to run around go for kills not just for my own pleasure and preferences but also for content i don't want to show a warzone win if it was just like two kills or something because i think as a viewer and maybe i wouldn't want to see that i'd be disinterested in it perhaps i'm wrong i don't know and i think that i would definitely win more matches if i was a bit more passive in my play style and waited in buildings more thought about where the zones moving next and trying to capture those power positions and i have tried playing like that it's just it turns me off so much maybe i need to find a nice balance and we'll get there eventually anyways that is all for today guys just wanted to get a few things off my chest and update you all on everything that's been going on i think it's been an interesting week of course we've got the cold war multiplayer reveal coming up on the night i'll be covering that don't miss out with that said if you enjoyed this video leave a
