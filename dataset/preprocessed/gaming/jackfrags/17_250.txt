while we've known for about a month now the call of duty warzone was going to get a new map before the end of the year we hadn't actually seen it and we didn't know any details about it but last night at the multiplayer reveal for call of duty vanguard they did have a small section on the new warzone map they showed some images of it and revealed a few details about it plus some extra bits about this brand new anti-cheat system that they've been developing so we're going to take a quick look at everything on that now and how that will change the face of warzone before the end of the year so here's the top and bottom of it then brand new map set in the pacific coming this year shortly after the launch of vanguard no specifics were given but i would say that they're gonna want a bit of breathing room for vanguard and let people play that and the normal multiplayer first before they get their teeth stuck into something new and exciting with warzone vanguard comes out november the 7th so i guess a month later maybe first week of december we'll get the new warzone map it will feature entirely new play spaces new points of interest lush landscapes through a variety of locations and as you can see it's very bright and colorful quite the stark contrast to what we have with 1980s for dansk so it's a fresh new experience for warzone and amos here said that it will allow them to really craft the narrative and events that are in the game now rather than just being stuck in the dance they're somewhere completely different now and i think that means that there's a better future for warzone because they won't have to just keep recycling the same map i for one i'm pretty bored of the dance now and i'd love to try something new i think in terms of size though it has to be as big as fedansk if it's not then i think they're missing a trick and i wouldn't be surprised if they remove that map completely when the new one comes out and just let people play this for a while perhaps they'd keep rebirth or add another smaller map maybe we'll have to wait and see so it will share the same engine as call of duty vanguard and we know that's the iw8 engine which is the same as the modern warfare engine so i don't foresee the feel of the game changing much at all i think it's going to remain the same it's the same engine i think perhaps the cod vanguard guns will feel a little bit different just because they're new and there's a question if they'll bring that new mounting system into warzone where you can slide left and right after you've mounted up and also the blind fire that we've seen in vanguard maybe that will come to war zone as well not that that's incredibly effective but i think if you were to master that system in close range firefights could be really advantageous but also really annoying at the same time of course vanguard is introducing a bit of destruction too and i'm sure that will feature heavily on the new warzone map this isn't the kind of destruction that we're used to seeing in battlefield of course i've played vanguard yesterday multiplayer i've played it in champion hill and the destruction seems very scripted and in very specific parts of the map it's not as dynamic as in other games but it could be used effectively if the map design and level design of this new map is tailored to fit that specific type of gameplay also they've got the demolition perk too i'm sure they'll introduce some of the vanguard perks into warzone demolition lets you see the arc of the grenade or tactical that you're throwing pretty cool feature might come to warzone as well now then this anti-cheat there was a little section about this and this whole bit where one of the characters was swinging a ban hammer they're calling this a new multi-faceted anti-chi they're in the final phases of testing it at the moment and this new anti-cheat for pc will be rolled out when the new warzone experience goes live now this has to be some kind of custom-made handcrafted kernel level anti-cheat i'm expecting the same kind of thing as what wright are using in valorum with their system vanguard from my experience that's very effective i've played a lot of valorum i've never come across a cheetah i don't really hear of people cheating in valorman either so whatever they're doing there it's working and if they've got a system similar to that or comparable i think the future for warzone and keeping cheaters away is looking good i'm a very positive person though and we've got to be realistic about this there's always going to be cheaters but the fact that they've actually put some time into this and they're announcing it and they're almost using it as a marketing thing here it gives me some faith that it's actually going to be good we'll have to wait and see time will tell on that one of course and aside from that just the usual stuff we know that warzone is going to have free post launch content on this new map there's going to be new modes new playlists there's going to be limited time modes events seasonal events and something called community celebrations didn't give any more info on that one naturally this raises a lot of questions doesn't it because when you think about all the moving parts in warzone how how is this going to work what are the logistics of this because i think the biggest issue is guns loadouts so hypothetically let's say when this new pacific map launches for warzone again let's guess it's december is it going to let you play with all of the weapons so this will be insane by the way if they do this modern warfare guns all the modern warfare guns or the secondaries launchers melee weapons all the cold war guns again full suite smg shotguns melee weapons secondaries launchers and then in addition to that all of the base game call of duty vanguard guns that's a lot of guns right like if they do that that's crazy but it's a possibility because i think one of the biggest reasons that they'll just let you play with everything is the fact that people have spent so much money and time into unlocking blueprints operator skins full warzone and they become attached to that let's say that when the vanguard map comes out the pacific you can only use vanguard guns in it that means that everyone's ever bought anything spent real money on card points they can't use their favorite guns anymore they can't use their favorite operators or sprays whatever it might be all that would go away so i think they're in a bit of a pickle here because i reckon what will happen is you can use everything i think that's what it's gonna be that causes a nightmare for balance game size it's just gonna get bigger and bigger and the logic of the game just becomes more and more intense and elaborate so it will become harder to develop for and manage everything perhaps have ran themselves into a corner here with warzone with it all being connected i love that by the way i think it's super cool that they are bridging the gap between every call of duty game with warzone but there will come a point where they have to go enough is enough it's too big it's too complex we can't balance it anymore we're starting from scratch it would be the bold thing to do for vanguard for the pacific map to do that and just go listen it's all world war ii guns now reality is i don't see them doing that particularly because one of the main reasons that warzone was so successful was because it had modern weaponry and guns in it and it's relatable people know what that stuff is they see it in movies maybe they even own some of those guns in certain countries and with gunsmith on top of the loadouts it just had this cool relatable factor to it and i can't see them going to world war ii guns only i think that wouldn't be a war zone anymore so i don't think that'll happen but let me know what you guys think down in the comments below it's a really really spaghetti tricky situation in my opinion how they gonna handle it leave a comment additionally this could affect the vehicles and the kill streaks in the game too if you think about vehicles at the moment we've got all modern style transports and helicopters world war two they didn't have helicopters they had an experimental one but helicopters are quite important to the gameplay of warzone so will they just forget the historical accuracy and put a modern transport helicopter in will the 4x4 be replaced with a willy's jeep could be kind of cool and then you've got to think about how they'll change the gameplay because i think if they just go here's a new warzone map but everything's the same maybe the appeal of that isn't too strong i think a lot of people would come back for a couple weeks and play and be like oh wicked new map but then if the gameplay doesn't change and evolve a bit it might just feel like the same old same old warsaw so perhaps they'll start to introduce tanks and planes it's a bit of a stretch but maybe plane controls were found in the control options of the game it's a possibility that they could be there on an airfield somewhere in the new warzone map jump in a spitfire do a strafing run parachute out rpg someone on the ground you never know some of that battlefield style sandbox gameplay again which was unintroduced to the cod franchise starts to creep in a bit more and the kill streaks too does an a10 thunderbolt doing a strafing run makes sense here maybe maybe not we'll see it could be that this is a pacific map set in 2021 we just don't know yet now one more thing before we wrap up today and this is kind of cool especially if you're a console player this tweet was posted yesterday by adam iscov and they're a senior development director at sledgehammer games working on call of duty vanguard and as you can see this is the console version of the game and finally they've got a field of view option all the way up to 120 which is the same as pc now there's no confirmation whether this is for next gen only it looks like this is on a playstation could be ps4 ps5 i think for the sake of parity they should give people the option in vanguard whether that's in the warzone map or the main vanguard game to change the field of view on old consoles and new consoles but i think they might have to put a disclaimer in there saying okay if you're on one of the older consoles and you use a bigger fov your performance will drop you'll get a lower frame rate because those consoles are so old now and i think that's one of the reasons that they haven't done it yet for console because maybe they just can't handle it but this is great finally it looks like they're listening they've added that as an option i think this is going to be perfect for anyone that's got a next-gen console ps5 the series x it seems like you'll have the option now keep in mind though this could just be vanguard might not be warzone i think it'll be both though makes sense to me and that's all guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one as always let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you enjoyed the video leave a like thank you
