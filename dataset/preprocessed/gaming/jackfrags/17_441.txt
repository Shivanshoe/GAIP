youtube recommended me something good for once this is a game called the day before and it's just kind of come out of nowhere so i saw the thumbnail on my recommended i was like yeah looks pretty cool i'll check it out turns out on the surface this is a really awesome looking open world multiplayer survival game and they just dropped this gameplay demo out of nowhere so i thought that we would take a look at it and just kind of discuss what's going on here so this game is developed by a team called a fantastic not really harder than before but i looked them up but they've made a couple games so far one called the wild eight which is a cop survival game and the other called radiant one which is a top-down short story adventure game and this caught my eye because i mean look at it like it looks gorgeous doesn't it a mix between the division last of us daisy and it reminded me a lot of the old survival games that used to play all right all right all right i have found a great cowboy hat nice matthew mcconaughey reference there we're in this downtown area checking all the vehicles for luke just found himself a nice cowboy hat and then this message comes in on the radio about a survival colony from what i read online there's not much on their website but the survival colonies are social hubs i suppose where you can craft weapons you can sell your gear you can buy gear you can make alliances with other players and then travel out into the world so obviously lots of multiplayer interactions will happen here we don't know how many players the game is yet there's no information on that gorgeous lighting and atmosphere in here as the guy heads into a store in the hope of finding some supplies i guess you can see in the bottom left hand corner there those ui elements we've got a cold meter an energy meter and a thirst meter underneath i guess that's the guy's health and you'll see how that all comes into play in the next scene so if you play any other survival games i think this will be quite familiar to you it looks like it's following that same mould not particularly doing anything innovative in that respect but for me the most impressive thing here is the level of detail it kind of looks like a single player game doesn't it and here it gets really like the last of us there's a squad of three players outside they come rushing into the store and you can hear them so perhaps this game's got proximity voice comms but he's adopted that stealthy crouch last of a stance right there it's oh so familiar he's outnumbered and they start shooting at him he fires back with the pistol takes one of them out throws a grenade wipes that player out and the third player just makes a run for it on the right gets them with a little tag and then of course you can loot players this dude had a helmet a jacket some pants nice shotgun and some rations by the looks of it but his buddy radios and says that he's outnumbered he needs some backup runs outside and a snowstorm is coming in and you notice that the cold meter starts to go down so your temperature is obviously a big part of the survival too but that noise that they've made has attracted the ai infected so this game also has a zombie type creatures which looks like you can put them down with a shotgun blast up close but again really just flexing the muscle here with the detail and as he turns the corner a horde of zombies run through in the inventory in the elevator that looks so much like the last of us inventory across the bandage so he doesn't die from bleeding so i've got those kind of mechanics in and outside the elevator there are just some idle docile zombies waiting to be triggered seems that stealth is a big part of this game too trying to find his friend through the apartment block could go up to the roof there by the looks of it very atmospheric kind of like a horror game now isn't it at the moment it says that this is only out on pc as well but i assume if they have a good launch then maybe they would bring this to console but it appears that his friend has just been absolutely destroyed by a zombie and then that's the end of the demo coming soon no idea of a release date but there is a website and there is a steam page so far but i thought that looked pretty neat and i wanted to share it with you guys obviously that's a scripted gameplay demo so no idea if the actual game will play as smoothly as that but on first impressions it's definitely got my attention and i wanted to share it with you guys in case you haven't seen it already with that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys and i'm gonna play the entire demo out now without my commentary on top so you can take in all the sounds and graphics for yourself
