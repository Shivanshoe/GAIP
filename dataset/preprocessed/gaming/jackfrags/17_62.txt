hope you're all doing well guys today i've got some bf1 gameplay from battle of the sum we'll be talking a little bit about that but also some battlefield stuff in general some really satisfying sniper shots in this one this was one of the last maps that they released for bf1 but it's actually one of the most popular like if you go in the server browser i don't know what it's like on console but on pc there's always people playing this map of course this battle was very iconic in world war one but it's interesting in this game because they have it as a conquest assault which means that the british team just start with a deployment and then the german team get the rest of the map and you've got to try and attack as the british and take it over and if you manage to do that then the german team won't have a deployment but there's a chance if they play well they revive bit of teamwork they can actually cap a flag back and then start deploying and it's just a very back and forth game mode conquest assault i think has been around since bf1942 i think there were a couple of maps there that had it one of them was suez and maybe battle of the bulge i'm just trying to remember my fondest memories of it come from bf2 and playing on striker carkin like it was such a good game mode on that map back in the day i always prefer playing as the attackers as well that's always been the case through all the battlefield games that i play i've always preferred attack defense just i get bored of it especially if you're playing against a team that isn't great because it just becomes a bit of a grind fest where you might be sniping at the back or something or you'll push right up and just bleed their tickets down to the next map but it does work very well on certain battlefield maps and games and the some on bf1 i think is definitely one of those now you may have figured it out already but obviously this isn't gameplay commentary sometimes i just i just like to play the game and record it's because playing the game and just focusing on that is very different to playing the game and recording microphone and commentary at the same time because whilst you're doing that you have to think about how it's going to be for the video what's the narrative is there some kind of storyline in this gameplay video or a point to be made something to be shown is it just generic having fun so actually getting to kick back and just play a few rounds of bf without like adding commentary on the top it was quite nice actually i liked it i might do some more of this in the future but hopefully you guys enjoyed this kind of video it's sunday's a bit of a lazy one today to be honest and i thought this would be a fitting video for today april in general really i mean the last couple of weeks has been quite busy for me just with some personal stuff from a business standpoint april is a busy month in terms of doing tax returns vac returns all that boring stuff lots of admin work yada yada not gonna bore you with the details but gameplay wise there's been a lot of bf 2042 happening with a couple of decent featured game modes and then of course the patch came out we've had the warzone godzilla stuff some more adventures in space with star citizen which i'm loving right now even though there's a ton of bugs just the level of detail in that game and the scope and the possibility is ridiculous even something like myth force you know the game that looked like the 80s cartoons played through the old bf3 co-op campaign with tommo that was really surprising lego star wars that was awesome really blew away any expectations that i had there we even did ranch simulator which i mean like i'm so grateful to you guys for the fact that i can play a game like ranch simulator and you'll turn up and watch that and support me i mean that video's got 224 000 views when i posted it i thought you know maybe like 100k or something it's not going to be popular but yeah i'm just blown away to be honest with the support like i love being variety on youtube fps games always going to be my bread and butter especially battlefield and definitely card you know i've gained a big card warzone audience over the last couple years and going forward this year modern warfare 2 they've been teasing some stuff war zone 2 i think is going to be massive modern warfare 2 in general there's rumors that modern warfare 2's got some kind of dmz extraction type game mode like the cycle or like escape from tarkov and if they've done that well you know they've been working on this for three years if the rooms are true that could be absolutely huge in terms of player base but also for content creators out there who are looking to jump into that game plus gameplay patch as well i've already done a full video with some gameplay talking about the patch and kind of saying you know it looks like that the game is on the right track now and that patch is how the game should have launched in terms of what dice had designed and set out to release i think it still has a long way to go for sure but it's just nice to see some positive sentiment in the community because since the first week of launch really it's just all been bad and i think that's fair the amount of bugs that the game launched with some of the design choices that were made still no real new content yet but they have actually stated again that they're looking at reworking the specialists they said that they're not going to get rid of them completely but reworking them there was a couple of replies on the ea forums where they do the answer stuff over there i don't really look at those forms but people often share interesting tidbits from them on reddit and social media and there was an answer that since the launch of the game they've seen the feedback on specialists from a gameplay perspective and they'll be reworking them but not completely removing them and i've talked about this before but i imagine that they'll just hardline each of the specialists into more of a classic battlefield class role so maybe you could only get the med kit if you were playing as angel and foul maybe you could only get a rocket launcher if you were playing as mckay and sundance for example i don't think they'll ever remove the ability to pick whatever weapon you want but i can definitely see gadgets and traits being hardlined into specific classes of specialists in the future i'm guessing that they'll focus much more on infantry in terms of weapons and map designs going forward too and i think a bit more destruction in the upcoming maps would be cool as well if you look at the play account on steam charts as well it's up to like 4 100 ish concurrent players at the moment and if you look at the history of concurrent players it started at 100 000 on steam in november last year and now it's four percent of that so there's obviously been a massive drop off of players up to this point of course that's just on steam the reality is that the game has a lot more players than that i think a lot of battlefield pc players would have bought it on origin and they'll be playing it on that you've got the epic game store as well and of course the three next-gen consoles ps5 xbox series s and x so they can all cross play together with pc all gen consoles ps4 and xbox one game is on there too but they're separate in their own ecosystem so i would love to see the actual total of concurrent players across the board rather than people who were just playing the game on steam mostly driven out of curiosity to see how much of an impact this patch has had on people playing the game and coming back to the game maybe buying it now and trying it out for the first time it's gonna be an interesting one to follow for sure and season one when that drops in summer that will be a big moment for this game and i think for a lot of people playing it will decide do i want to invest more into this or just leave it where it is and in between now and summer june i would guess there's probably going to be a couple more patches for the game and maybe those specialist reworks will be included in there hopefully the map changes they've talked about too with some of the existing 2042 maps for me personally after playing a lot of the flashback conquest game mode and infantry conquest on the bad company two maps in portal and the bf3 maps 64 players only two for me it becomes more obvious that the map design of the new maps maybe that is one of the biggest problems with the game as it stands so perhaps going forward i swing the pendulum back to 64 players maybe that'll apply to future games as well we'll see and that's all i wanted to chat about guys today hopefully you've enjoyed this one bit of chatter and enjoyed the gameplay in the background there some sniping on the battle of the som bf1 classic sniping's great in it love that map hates all the spots you know with that said have a great day leave a like if you enjoyed it dislike if you didn't subscribe for more i'll see you next time
