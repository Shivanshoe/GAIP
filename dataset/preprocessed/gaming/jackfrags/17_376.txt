ones hear our voice together as one in reverence we call on thee within the endless dark to deliver us into faith's hands as the midnight moon rises on black wings so we make our sacrifice and await the light at the end in life and in death we give you glory mother miranda it's pretty intense no the tea should be ready come help me elena please that prayer i've heard it before there was an old woman near the graveyard give me that a [ __ ] as crazy as a bag of rats there is wisdom in her devotion though and i hope it protected her as it shall protect us [Laughter] what are you doing
