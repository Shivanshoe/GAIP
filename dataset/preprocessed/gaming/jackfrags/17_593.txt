hi everyone and welcome to part three of my god of war walkthrough so we're continuing from where we left off we're right at the top and we're about to do this puzzle collapse there's a bowl but how do we get to it we cannot there's some weird looking pictures on the walls here and a hell thing there so i think i should be able to break this boy send the boy through epic jump dude epic what does it say when time itself is discerned the forward path is retrograde retrograde it's backwards those symbols the seasons yeah but the orders will jump shouldn't it be winter spring summer autumn why start with winter it's from a song mother used to say don't i know that one winter lot quiet doesn't like music either so i think that's spring so if we do spring summer autumn winter i think that's autumn then this one should be winter how's that boy adventure yes that's it that word it means endure try it oh damn it just repaired it write it again the energy's lifting the platform keep writing head how is this possible my guess temporal magic dangerous stuff the high vineyard gods used to play around with the ability to please time happened to be a favorite of mjord himself in fact used to why did they stop well turns out stop in time keeps the sun and moon from streaking across the sky unfortunately it does not stop the wolves that chase them always looking to sink their teeth in after that they decided it was best to leave time alone that's broken we're going to be attacked all the way up all the way good job kid smashed use the walls yeah i'm pretty sure they're upgraded that i made a bit bigger do it again kid get on it [Music] who else wants someone dude that's a problem all right his arrows are actually bouncing between them now that must be one of the upgrades that i got oh all right that's one of the new abilities that i got it infuses the axe with cold explosions it does a lot of damage i picked up a new abilities and skills in part two i wasn't really using them so i'm gonna try and use them a lot more this time when i'm fighting should make things a bit easier for me stay back painful yeah there is where'd they come from no idea super easy i like how the head actually calls out and tells you where they're going he's watching your back you know ah not you get off just straight away [Music] we're gonna have to grab onto that thank you he's busy doing his thing no kid that was a close one oh we're right at the top now you did well thanks good boy just having a little fun you big trump [Laughter] yeah the head is hilarious i think his name is is that how you pronounce it miyamir something like that well there it is how are we going to get it free a push but trust me it's simple we'll use our herculean strength dig in and push with everything yes sir that's away surely oh we're gonna ride it down why would i get i have it yeah right you know that cracked good we should keep moving oh that was just a term that i used in warzone you're absolutely cracked ted the chisel tip give the man credit he has a talent for destroying things remember that head never leaves my mind [Laughter] head there's nothing wrong with destroying a few things every now and again is that come on it's fine how would i drop down there then maybe i can get around another way is that necessary i mean is that the guys from the mountain from before father not now that could be the brothers that were at the top of the mountain modi his name is i think can i not do a flying assassination that'd be good wouldn't it just in case you never know those are the guys we saw with balder yeah his nephews hi magni and modi the sons of thor mother always said the acer were the worst of gods and thor was the worst of the easier i guess he's a terrible father too they are no longer children they have no excuse will syndra be okay they'll never even see him they're actually those sons i didn't realize that ah the great dining hall envy of all midgard funny i remember there being a mask you just can't help but break things can you the yar's throne was just on the other side of that wall of ice i picked that up i can steal a bit from it i'm just gonna throw it at this and see if it doesn't even it doesn't we still don't know what those things are there sure we'll get to use them soon okay hello oh he's throwing rocks that's that's new that is neat come on just throw these out if it lets me pick it up it didn't let me pick it up the double rock oh my god [Music] hold on let me get some help let's come back a bit now now you can't pick it up i suppose if i bring him near it i could explode it like that i didn't really do much wow this guy's a bit trickier than the other [Music] ones here we go that's a really strong power of that the axe it's a cool looking ogre that just split his face open what the hell [Laughter] let's see give me all the things yeah so that oh it's back now another troll it's an icy boy of his own what are you doing what are you doing nope not like that get the walls get the walls oh god okay it's called the stone beard king i just realized that's such a cool name here we go big damage yeah the graphics are brilliant on this game plan ko gaming they're very good oh good job boy broke focus up boy [Applause] what oh where did you come from they just leaped out so good why even all these animations nice combo smash it's just a bit excessive isn't it you know it's very excessive oh that's not cool geez [Laughter] yes that's uh welcome to god of war if you're just tuning in on part three for some reason you missed the other two parts this is uh this is standard fair standard fair anyways so that thing will actually last forever you can just carry it around with you something ahead see what he's fine but at best event there is thor's idiot sons showed up i don't mean all right so we've got i think we've got a boss fight coming up here i'm feeling creative today okay they've given us right before i can hear them talking so they're definitely definitely around no no don't disappoint father no no no no that's got a room socket level four keep upgrading atreus that's at max now okay master trace how may i sir enhancements here yeah i need to collect more stuff for that don't i i like the idea of gold but i just can't afford any of it yet so we may have to come back to that right come back anytime we'll do so i really do feel like we've got a fight on our hands here can i just take this with me if there is a boss fight will it despawn i don't know i'm going to take it just in case could you take a look at this honestly i don't have much else going on right now get this chest i bet i'm not gonna even need it am i are you looking at kid that's gonna drop it here i think all right the chisel hurry brother we may get a piece of the chisel and be gone before they even notice what are the chances of that oh yes boy i told you i knew it surrender the old father demands it no that is a very big sword this fight is mine boy go [Music] and where oh the other one oh no brother the little freak's got a bow what are we gonna do small one don't tell me he's running at me like a mad dog [Music] so don't have to worry too much about that although he's running at me right now stop it yeah i can't remember the last time we figured power of the axe oh he's down i have to get the other one down [Music] stay behind me boy why do you hunt us what does odin want oh no don't care come here oh god this is horrible shut up calm yourself boy jeez i'm trying to get the big one first [Music] shut it out focus [Music] so he hits his brother and it takes us to this weird state she cut up your face don't talk about my mother don't talk about my mommy don't listen to him trying to rail you up that's a bait i don't like that [Music] baby now welcome head started oh that was close they're actually using each other i should have blocked that i need help just block up oh that was close okay he's gone no more oh no i'll tell you [Applause] no how did you you have no idea you're a son of a [ __ ] sickness fever has returned no it hasn't roy the coffin the blood the boy's sick he needs flare no steady i'll be all right where do you go lad he doesn't look alright i'm fine see we should keep an eye on him oh we just killed one of saul's sons he won't be happy about that nope not at all oh cool two big acts of grace there you're an axe in the face can i not pick up his weapon please let's get the chisel just need a little piece there it is enough should do with that we can carve the travel room to jottenheim get you where you need to go oh incidentally all those magically sealed doors we've seen can now be unlocked that one around the corner you can get through that door there now that you've got the chisel find the binding point not there so you just feel a little vibration in your controller and that tells you where to hit it i don't know how that would work if you had vibration turned off that he did he was a god but you killed him mine are acl perhaps but i in his father's store not miner not minor at all him this will not go over well in asgard i defended us nothing more i fear no judgment judgment no but a vengeance is any concern since when can you kill a god so the sea was quite easy to find but they always make the other two difficult don't they i don't immediately see any of the letters here there's not a dead ogre in there put in the prison for some reason you just sneeze atreus what's you're not allowed to sneeze i'm afraid it's not that's not permitted this is cool it could be anywhere hey oh i kind of feel bad for him so what's the point of jumping down here indeed i have to come back to that one later perhaps we will continue the story and soldier on we got a shortcut there as well listen wait we were here before but which way back what can i do for you too okay big upgrades it's a sad day for your enemies it is indeed yes my young man what was the other one that i got i don't like the fact that it takes my runic down so much yes dear boy yes dear boy what shall it be the weighted grip of restoration i think it was that one yeah i need smoldering embers that just gives you enchanted dust back don't let the dragger get you all right mate the travelers oh disgusting smelly covered in god knows how many little beasties but gorgeous armor let's see if i can't make something more sanitary yes i can do whatever you need that was the axe pommel that one can't afford it a scale fragment from the world serpent what how am i gonna get that well scrounge around a bit more and we'll build something then fine who's giving me some serious lip i don't think the lads doing too well if so then keep up one there on there i don't think they're all gonna be the same but that one was quite similar to the first one hey i just realized magne didn't come back to life that is interesting it's known the acl find their own way to valhalla no valkyrie escort no processing at the gates of helheim that may be significant so he's dead dead we killed him dead gods can kill other gods ah let me change arrows i thought that would do something get that crystal down we have to use that first throw it up there there was a thing back here so what is that dust of realms interesting there's a chest here steel all right let's go look at the giant's head what the big thumbs up specimen would bring the day's catch into this port and use that contraption to send some of it directly to the owl's main kitchen the rest were sorted and sold there is an exit under the thumb find a way across dude he's absolutely ruined i feel really sad for him that doesn't stick in there it does he just needs a bit of lemon sip maybe some nyquil i'll fix him right up so i think i've got to put it in the middle and then freeze it so we can jump onto it nice please oh we can't reach it jump up this way there is an opening i can get it there's a path to the exit on the other side all right he can get on that now send him over come on boy i can throw that down there's a rope up here i don't like the fact that he's he's sick i don't like that dude don't worry what do you think they did to the voice actor make him sound sick i think that did it i think that did it just pretending some axe you can change it to performance mode if you want it to run at high frame rate it only renders at 1080p but you get higher frames i prefer higher frame rates it still looks very good even on 1080p but a combat game like this i think you've got to play it at 60fps it doesn't hold a consistent 60 fps but most of the time it is there are some areas where it drops a lot that one's a bit different i'm back at the north we're almost there what everything we just did climbed around a dead giant wrote a giant falling hammer fought some bad gods what do you think mother would say that you have come a long way thanks agreed return to the lake of nine what now then maybe fail to have a look at the boy no i feel better now i just needed to catch my breath where do we go next well now that we've got the giants chiseled we need to learn the travel room to your night so we can carve it into that special gateway atop the peak and open realm travel to the land of the giants you don't know it the last snow but the serpent did mention that the giants had entrusted that secret for tear isn't it tear dead hi but his hidden boat is very much in reach the doors are beneath his temple submerged in the lake for generations until our snake friend shifted his weight there we shall find the fabled black wound of yottenheim we could also explore some more we got that drizzle now and that ball isn't going anywhere it seems a shame to waste a boat we shall see boy the black rune of yortenheim that sounds op look at these vistas man lemir you're in the middle of a story before what were you saying about the long war enough was enough and at last odin's most brilliant advisor became determined to find a more enlightened path he set about to broker a peace between the gods it took some convincing but ultimately odin was persuaded to marry his deadliest enemy a certain banner goddess legendary not only for her fertile beauty but her genius at the very vanier magic that odin had long aspired to master freya married odin what was in it for her it was a sacrifice to protect her people a selfless act of love julie she deserves better than she got but of course there's more to that story huh the man just knows everything it's like the three-eyed raven in game of thrones kind of just knows the whole of history ever sure is behind that magical law we like to pretend that season 8 didn't happen and they're still you know they're still working on it coming soon game of thrones season eight oh this one's got three what changes let's find it there it is wow i can't believe we're setting foot in tiers vault another one of these it's tear but the middle panel is missing someone stole it kid was a guy not a giant ah but he was loved by everyone including the giants other than me he was the only one they gifted with their special sight hey i wonder if the giants left a triptych about me somewhere too yeah it's not all about you is it it's all me me me actually come look let me show you how to read this that is not necessary taught me so much let me teach you something andreas come on you already speak it learning to read won't be that hard i know how to read boy just not this tongue you're halfway there already then okay so the rooms represent a lot of different things some gods some animals wait oh am i going too fast sorry not that you smelled something yeah i do smells like rain oh he's back you ruined everything i earned that [ __ ] hammer but now everyone's gonna think i only got it because maggie's gone be a joke but if i kill you no one's going to laugh at me oh are you dumb that your father's doing or did you get it from your mum she's stupid and ugly shut up you don't know anything about my mother oh it's true but i'm gonna get to know you really well you're gonna be my new brother right after i finish killing your [ __ ] oh no way he's got the rage whoops muslim car broke him [Laughter] stay back no no this isn't over brother the boy at your ears you have to get into flare quickly there's no other way [Music] oh man he looks really sick [Music] take the boat freya's isn't far the whole atmosphere has changed strange odin's eye is on you brother especially now that you've taken to killing his kin as forest is a blind spot for him this is our smartest move anyone can heal him it's hot what is happening damn i've seen it immortals that some conflict of the mind expresses itself as an ailment of the body never by god but a god believing himself mortally i can only imagine we're almost there at some point kratos is gonna have to tell him if a god has a kid the kids are god right surely it works like that somebody just called the serpent maybe a half god a demigod the fever burns hotter he is shaking it's serious we must hurry i don't think freya was a god [Music] oh she's a goddess we need your help woman do you hear me it is urgent i'm still a god go away the boy has followed you freya this is no ordinary illness the boy's true nature your true nature fights within him [Music] i did this to him [Music] will you help me of course there is a rare ingredient found only in helheim the keeper that protects the bridge of the damned i need its heart hell the realm of the dead do you know it note this one it is a land of unyielding cold fires cannot burn there and no magic in all the nine realms can create a blaze as for the dead your frost axe will be useless you'll need to find something else [Music] then i must return home dig up a past i swore would stay buried who you were before doesn't matter this boy is not your past he is your son and he needs his father [Music] this rune opens the bridge to hell height when you are there do not under any circumstances cross the bridge of the damned there is no road back understand boy you must hurry oh he's not dead in my garden there's a path leading to my boat take it return home dig up your past do whatever you need to do just bring me back the bridge keeper's heart and your son may survive and last we spoke i was no you were right to distrust the word of a god no need to explain not to me not for that i will keep him safe that's the mother's promise helheim of all places you all right brother i will do what i must leave me be no no no something's going down store isn't it it's gotta be your odin [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] excuse me [Music] athena get out of my head [Music] so too spooky i did play the older god of war games yes i never played ascension i played one two and three i forgot these guys were here watch your back [Applause] got a chance to help hey [Applause] yes [Applause] get down kids that's what my ties are special that one all right we're back home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh no way it's a blaze of chaos completely forgot there's no way you can hide spartan put as much distance between you and the truth as you want damn it changes nothing he's putting him on pretend to be everything you are not teacher husband father but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape you cannot change you will always be a monster i know it's about to get real i'm your monster no longer [Music] that's a completely different moveset it's like riding a bike let's throw them oh my god you can bring people towards you that is so sick this is the best thing ever i was not expecting this i've completely forgotten about it get over here i better have so much fun designing this a door to the realm between realms over there in your own front yard no less take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple then on to helheim yeah that was that was so sick i love that i'm weeping because of how awesome that was oh dear he's hearing me uh where do we need to go there's the title it's just the mystic gate where we need to go to i forgot what he said need to look this up right hang on so weapons so they have rune slots as well spawn's heritage have i just got a whole set of new skills now i mean come on it's just a completely new skill tree that's actually sick that's a juggle attack [Music] [Music] i kind of just don't want to upgrade the axe anymore but i suppose i have to right [Music] [Music] oh right i think we have to go back to the main hub and we have is it joltenheim we're going to something like that if we go here the mystic gateway well i'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there anything you'd like to get off your chest brother i can assure you i'm unsurpassed in keeping confidences well you know where to find me and for the record i'd already guessed you were greek athena dead giveaway dead giveaway the giveaway i mean just the the red tattoo not give it away what hey you wreak your foreign magic what are those what are those i've never seen the like that's got to be a family heirloom no nor will it ever be son my brother and me created me all near for the big idiot i know from quality and them them special hey where's the little turd he was falling ill no what happened he see her no the fault is mine and my responsibility to make it right now we all got to take responsibility sometime huh say what can i do to help i can do things when i should tag along no your work here is enough all right so where are you off to in such a hurry the realm of the dead hellheim [ __ ] this is serious i'll be keeping my eye on you yeah you can upgrade them whole new weapon set catch you later brock have a great time right to jodenheim now that freya has given you the travel room to helheim it should be unlocked on the line yeah the owen heim is after helheim i think it's obviously we were gonna go there but atreus fell ill some weird [ __ ] going down here man hellheimer got it the realm of the dead oh this sounds like it's going to be fun i'm ready i'm warming up let's go take me there i mean some of those realms i haven't even been to yet i'll be watching your back it's very strange isn't it let me take this moment to tell you that what you're about to do is absolutely insane the dead use it to cross into their permanent home the city of hellhound bridge keeper reminds admission he's the one we want this bridge should lead us straight to it i really hope never to see this place again you just weren't expecting the blades of chaos nobody expects it get over here use the fire of your blades to burn away that hell's bramble blocking the path oh yeah god of war 3 had some awesome boss fight moments in it spartan charge okay i don't have another one yet the many reasons we went back for those blades uh hi that combo is massive damage like really big damage [Applause] they're like fast zombies i guess he swings around and wants it it's a big airway effect it's actually freezing me i don't know it's not slowing me down i feel like when they hit you with those javelins it does actually slow you down too many the gate must be closed and if the gates close then it's true hell's full up without the valkyrie just sort of kill them well how can hell be followed hell has hell has a capacity limit it's like disney world sorry can't come in today we're at maximum attendance and you didn't get you didn't get the express pass sir i'll come in you'll have to go to that other place instead fine i guess [Music] huh i still got my shield attacks obviously is there an effective way to break the block i'm sure i've got an ability that does it double top l1 dude i'm just trying to practice moves on you a parry's a good way of doing it as well there we go that works really well when we killed the reavers near my home they came here how did they return so quickly time doesn't move the same between all realms especially where the spirit world is concerned like the light of alphine the opposite in fact the lake of souls feels faster than i'll find time but hell is much slower than midgard sorry i'm sure that's confusing if we will be back to my son all the sooner that is good ah aren't you a quick study i guess i can burn that down [Music] is there another one on that side yeah come to me chest i need to see what's inside give it to me exhale leave those there this green effect is so cool it's almost like they're trying to like suck the life out of me or something [Music] hi [Music] you know what's really interesting something i've noticed with the combat i don't know if you guys have picked up on this watching but when the animation hits the target it almost stops the animation you get what i mean it does like a momentary force as if it's as if the sword or the blades are being dragged through the target and it just gives it this really cool it has a weight to it i guess it just freezes for a split second i don't know if you can notice it is it within hell you can feel it when you're playing only the worthy dead go there the warriors who die in glorious combat hell is for those who die and dishonor criminals i and those dead of disease mishap age it is dishonorable to grow old well never too late to go out fighting i suppose it's dishonorable to grow old i don't know about that better go the other side oh it's one of those crows that climb there could lead us out if we can reach it that's the second one i have not been paying attention oh we can climb up that now i'm sure that lots of games will copy that as well going forward we're killing the bridge keeper help the dead lead midgard i don't expect it well though i don't suppose it will make things any worse either it'll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of helheim who'd be mad enough to go there hmm demons well i haven't got a trace here so how how would i do that maybe come back to it making sure the dead are really dead what is that he holds that totem contains a powerful source of magical energy the very power of hellheim itself but what you want is his heart just take it and we can leave okay start some trouble you can do that right hey mate i just come for the heart for your heart no big deal he's not happy to see me he disappears he does i know he's throwing things at me i don't i don't like this away in his health [Music] oh no we got minions you can actually get here they just permanently follow you as well those weird things [Music] i need some help oh no did you say stop him he speaks english i'm just doing this thing again guys [Applause] no oh my goodness this teleports right for me now it's better don't why have you done that ah i guess wrong where's he gone he's really dead i got him give me your heart i need that really important to me it's probably really important to you as well but i kind of need it so my son doesn't die and you're just here in the realm of the dead just making sure everyone stays dead so i think i'm the good guy in this situation and i'm just going to take that no the heart it'll be fine you'll have to get your hands danty rip it out kratos get it get it back to slay monsters just like we were in ancient greece getting messy cracking open rib cages what does a troll's heart look like very unusual [Music] it's covered in blood rest in peace lot [Music] i'm sorry i have to be you [Music] i have the heart i need nothing more you're set i can't not to linger here though [Music] what is that kratos zeus my father your father was this well that explains a lot what is that place never go there understand how is he here that is not possible it's just an illusion hell's known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past we should focus on getting back to your son can we just take a second to appreciate this what whatever that is it looks like a giant raven i don't i'm not sure but i like it a lot big fan of that also dead dad's up just chilling out over there somewhere that's fine nbd yeah dude are you supposed to be why are you everywhere it's cold real quick give me your blades why yeah i said i'd help you and i aim to come on all my equipment's in mid cars be right back yeah you don't suppose any necklace do you yeah now they're ready for the winds of hell just target this magical goalie get here with your blades and throw the winds of hell 10 seconds your target that wind trap with your blades it's that little ball hanging in the middle of the door there see it just let her loose now you can absorb and release the winds of hell whenever it damn pleases so you're welcome and i believe this place is cold enough to freeze a pair of pigeon eggs i sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain what we have been away we just disappeared instantly i'm convinced that he's invisible and just follows me everywhere cool [Music] take it from there put it in here open some doors big fan of that can i throw it at people i missed it went back to its own place ow it didn't really seem to do any additional damage there did it sir everyone's going invisible now don't like it [Music] i'm not get that one sorry brother i'm still stuck in what i heard back there zeus was your father not now we should focus on getting out of hell with that i cannot argue i'll just contemplate that little nugget in silence there please do [Applause] just again what we have to do both of them right just got to do it quick ten seconds [Music] imagine getting to hell and then this happens kratos is there just smashing you up hey [Music] ah the unblockable it again well i was looking absolutely is almost gum [Music] that's really fun fighting those i like that a lot [Music] all right so we need the energy what is that long thing there okay that's just a straight straight upgrade right there i don't think i've got another room for that yet there's an artifact of some delineation [Applause] um oh cool i do accidentally so many times it's a one-hit killer [Music] the hell was that aah good there's a chest there just pull it towards me could i oh it's simple there's just a little path who is leaving all these chests around by the way i thought we're supposed to be in hell here what would the people living here need with chess you know what i mean what would be the point for them they don't need chests they're dead good good this is where we came in what the hell was that that's what they're used for [Music] get over here that will never get old you made it better get home to your boy already can we do this upgrade blades of chaos the chaos balloon love that i've got new skills chaos is looking like an absolute chaos kratos is looking like an absolute baller right now i think really i've got to go and do some exploring to get enough stuff to upgrade all the other stuff because i never seem to have enough resources we shouldn't delay brother it's straight back to midgard with that heart see we can fix the trace your father was zeus hey finally understand i'm dangling from the hip of the bloody ghost of sparta do not call me that don't mistake me brother from what i have the pantheon had it coming it's still a bit to take in i knew you hate gods but you really can't stay away from them can you you must say nothing to the boy he must never know paul likes brother respectfully he has to know you'll never be whole without the truth look i get it you hate the gods all gods it's no accident that includes yourself and it includes your boy do you see that he feels that he can't help what he is can't begin to help him because you haven't even told him it's all connected man you will tell him nothing why is he so afraid to tell him i don't understand you don't need to protect him if i was a god or a demigod i'd want to know about it yeah until one day you know that shortcut between realms well i made it better oh did you or i might have broke it we use that i know you do so i took a few cuts from them winds of hell and made it so it ain't just one way now you can use it to travel to and from if i didn't breaks it then we can take it to freyja there's an idea brother as i was saying i'd like to know if i was a god or a demigod until one day you know maybe i was about to die and then suddenly i don't die because i'm a god and i'd be like oh right oh my god might be some kinks to sort out but you'll make it you would find out wouldn't you know well you gentlemen certainly know how to get around this is a trick this is the game loading it's a cool story element but it's a distraction below that huge area i suppose they worked out that if you run from this point to that point over there that's enough time for the ps4 to load that level rather than just having a black screen that says loading it's a lot more engaging isn't it well this isn't right but close enough he did say there were kinks we must hurry just what's the point of the axe anymore it's just it's dead to me i mean i assume i'm doing this right i'm just guessing that's the edge here isn't there i don't think we even needed that didn't we change weapon i guess we come back to that later there's something here wasn't there you could so easily miss that it'd be the easiest one to miss all right let's fix the boy the heart you have it just don't sit in the soup back of your hand [Music] you still will [Music] i can break the fever but to heal he must know the truth of what he is yes it is not so simple help me prop him up did i tell you that i have a son too it's been forever since i last saw him at his birth the runes foretold the needless death the babe in my arms was so small so helpless i knew right then i would do anything to protect him no matter the sacrifice of course everything i did i did for myself i let my needs my fears come before what he needed and i couldn't see his resentment until it was too late don't make the same mistake have faith in him i know the truth isn't simple but nothing is when it involves your child it is a curse a boy has been cursed don't leave without me i will not i'm better now i see that is he well enough to travel for now it won't happen again i promise you see that it does not so boy's back freya i will not forget this your father did the heavy lifting you should stay recover you have done enough you know my door is always open to you it's good to be back kid that's venom isn't it you figured that out did you well the window looks like bifrost crystal and i know that's not what's on the other side of the wall and well it makes you sad you are wise for one so young yes this is a window to a home i left long ago but it is only a few the thing that happened to you in alphonse you can't leave midgard can you a gift from my former husband upon our separation why would odin try to be in midgard petty cruelty would be reason enough for him but as with all his rash decisions he's driven by fear the van air were the greatest threat to the acre until our marriage broke her to peace many of the vanier now think i betrayed them the fruits of my sacrifice to be hated by my own kind to trap me here is to ensure i can never make it right it's kind of sad um so we're always wondering why do you live under a turtle he was my first friend here in midgard he offered me shelter and in return i provide him with protection against the evils of the forest golden boar giant turtle you sure have some interesting friends it's like a plot to a disney movie pixar i'll be knocking on the door right now then before modi so rudely interrupted us we were just about to explore tears vault jordan yes to find the black rune boy do you know the way from here oh i don't know sure you do lad we need a boat i don't know i guess we need a boat okay then oh he's got an emo oh you saw emo atreus i just brought you back from the dead basically it's fine come on your dad's a god he's got a kick-ass axe i'll go show you my new blaze as well at some point do you want to see him it is check these out doesn't care not interested in the blades just wants to play fortnite ah see the boat washed ashore someone did call a seven earlier you are quiet are you not better i guess i know you overheard my talk with freya you think you understand that you do not why'd you say nothing you said i was cursed you think i'm weak because i'm not like you i know i was never what you wanted but after all this i thought maybe things were different you do not know everything boy no but at least i know the truth now the truth the truth i'm a god boy from another land far from here when i came to these shores i chose to live as a man but the truth is i was born a god and so were you oh snap dab boy have nothing to say um can i turn into an animal can you turn into an animal [Music] no no i do not think so i'm a god mother knew she was a god too no she was mortal but she knew my true nature i'm a god why did you wait so long to tell me i had hoped to spare you being a god it can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy that is the curse what sorts of things can i do can i fly turn invisible i don't feel like god i do not know the reach of your godhood over time we'll learn i'm glad that he finally told him you sure i can't turn into a wolf you are welcome to surprise me is this why i hear voices sometimes are you sure you've never heard any not as you do that's no surprise every god is unique so maybe i won't be strong like father but i'll have abilities on my own you already do laddie your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young time alone will tell what else you'll become capable of so you knew all along i get lad but i've known more than my share of gods me too apparently that kid is going to be sick at cranking 90s freya for sure rocking sundry there you do not need to know boulder does he know is that why he's after us do you know him from before the day of your mother's funeral was the first i ever saw balder that is the truth hey we don't have to go right back to chairs ball really i mean we're god we can do whatever we want right what do you really feel like doing right now i will show you let's try this again without interruptions they're like grabbing the five guys and fries and strawberry milkshake here we go again all right no fight this time guys okay don't just appear out of nowhere swallow to spring forth life tomorrow oh i like that one i wonder if i wrote it huh what are you doing kid there's some runes on the wall there just goes back here we go again read it death itself i swallow to spring forth life tomorrow oh i like that one i wonder if i wrote it hmm is that the answer there says earth hmm swallows death brings forth life fire water uh captain planet i wish i had known i was a god and alphonse i wouldn't have felt so bad about killing so many elves well i'm not sure that's the lesson you've done nothing to regret the elves force their affairs upon us no i get it now we had god things to do and they were on the way dragging us into their little problems again are we just leaving that there i mean just knowing we're gods makes me feel so much stronger maybe you feel a little too good right now with power comes a big choice lad you can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others like tyr people really loved him huh i a god of war but one who fought for peace had a reputation for being heroic and lawful using his power and knowledge to stop wars rather than start them so there are good gods once in a moon it's been known to happen yes that's me he was talking about me head this one mentions places i've never heard of seems tyr really like to travel dear believed the mind not might was key to preventing war chaos and he also knew visiting other cultures would give him perspective staying in one place could not while odin always hoarded knowledge guarding it jealously tyr was open and sharing with his landing and his wisdom for this mortals adored tyr showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over [Music] so whatever happened here odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule he suspected tyr of collaborating to aid the giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for this year same thing he accused me of frankly though in tears case i believe he was right you think jira was helping the giants i do he felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by odin i suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks they're missing your name correct whatever happened to it i believe it could only have been done with tyr and the giants working together i mean there was like egypt and samurai up there they could gonna war is basically assassin's creed now isn't it they can just go wherever they want i don't know i've never been in here the stone that has to be it wow it's protected i didn't think it would be that easy no just kind of hoping though so what now deactivate the defenses rather a trap for the winds of hell but where do you think the winds are the ones of what oh we forgot to mention that when you were sick we went to hellheim to get your cure you did terrible experience by the by your dad picked up a new trick though with a little help from brock brock was there too i but we'll get back to this later treasure ah a skiing dew from my homeland used to have one of all and back in the day you should take it boy yes boy take it we might need to butter bread somewhere in our travels you've already got a knife no one likes you oh this is gonna be fun that's cool i can't remember what you do with this this vault is awesome all this treasure piles of gold and silver read it boy one of these thought is faster than wind solving problems with our heads rather than our feet keeps me fine gold smoking a pancake some health around here you know for someone so loved dear sure was paranoid ah thanks to odin with good reason that's a door that you can't open the lighting is gorgeous isn't it that's a weird looking ogre statue that's the way i went up before that's the way back out we can't leave here without the black room yeah come on we can do this something here maybe move it or you may lose it brother oh where am i putting it there's one on the inner ring there now stick it here [Applause] oh it's created a wheel okay that looks horrible look at this death trap in here what is this look small passages on either side perfect for the boy all right boy well you'll be fine yeah i'll have to go through the death trap would be far no big deal there's a role there you can careful brother leah's not here to bring you back if you're cutting too freeze that one [Music] look at that i feel like the next game is going to be samurai or something like that because they keep teasing it i think they've said they're working on god of war 5 as well [Music] that's definitely greek [Music] smells like home [Music] [Applause] oh it's him no show the boy [Music] what the hell what'd you find i just broke it enough distraction do not forget why we are here okay that's egyptian i think [Music] he knows scarab beatles that's from a great desert land very far from here the gods live there oh my yes many many gods good or bad and not as simple as that i'm afraid this whole place is awesome level design is great hey boys need my blades of chaos [Music] there we go charge last good again uh good night there's more i'm very thankful for the indicator there telling me there was someone behind me otherwise i would never know it is not important seem important to you it was a ration pulse you need not dwell on my failings wow that was well i guess you do like to smash buttons that's a different kind of smasher look i just want to know the truth now okay i don't care if it hurts me or not i want to learn just because you hate being a god doesn't mean i have to being a god is difficult kid okay more small passages i know go i can't watch brother good luck hey there's a little bit on the side here fine i think it's fine i thought those saws were scary look it's the wolf giants it's golden hottie that's right the bringers of day and night ragnarok begins when they catch the sun and moon right did you know him i don't know like them well enough to cover a massive wall in his boat with him though that's so shiny don't you enjoy it at all being a god on an adventure in some amazing place it's great kid maybe mother wanted us to have a little fun comes with a lot of baggage though okay everything we've seen and done maybe it was her gift am i supposed to get that one hmm go up to the top perhaps but then would i have time to get down i'm not sure let's have a look there's no way it's not enough time unless you can just jump down nope stupid stupid [Music] [Music] i do feel like the axe does slightly more damage than the blades of chaos but i haven't graded it a lot so that's probably why i'm ready done look there's the wind trap could i transfer it hmm i think what i might have to do is transfer it so i can access it from down low i put it in that one there for example there we go clever now i should be able to get an angle on it from down here put it in there okay there's one more room wasn't there [Music] oh that's the witch's you can do this please hurry i don't know yet foreign middle middle quickly who left sunrise right in the middle right man left boy middle number and right the right boy there we go it's that simple oh i can't drown yes that's something we're not stopping wait what's that big boy you have to stop that chain i do not know stick your knife in it do it i know what to do for a knife there's no other way it's not working [Music] what is that a knife i know but it saved you that was cunning boy can i use the blue arrows weird so we finally got the room the road's free i think we did it all right let's go see what tier's got for us oh no raised protection it rubbed off what should we do we keep going there it is we've got it oh this weird floating mask thing boy on the day you were born i made two knives mixing metals from my home and from this land one for myself and when you were ready one for you today is that day i'm a man like you no you're still a boy boy we are not men we are more than that the responsibility is far greater and you must be better than me understand say it you will be better power of this weapon any weapon comes from here the heart but only when tempered by this the brain by the discipline the self-control of the one who wields it that is where the true strength of a warrior lies you must never forget that [Music] good then come on blank what no he can power it wait i knew it was going to come to life did you see it yes are you certain i got it grendel of the ashes good then aim for the face okay all right so i've got to use different weapons i'll use my axe on the fire boy i'm going to use the chaos on him i'll get this down first come here do the fire one first that actually created like a thing in the ground that was awesome the double swing i hate that right in the face jeez i wasn't even paying attention to him that's such a cool effect i need some help i'll do one at a time oh the other one's dead already ah i think i've got a resurrection stone damn it that's bad i've almost got my heel back [Music] that was close i had to use my resurrection stone as well but no match for us god that's another upgrade for the blades okay puny troll yeah i'm turned around [Music] cool [Music] yeah that spawn charge is wicked big fan of that upgrade the blades again more emulation okay don't mind if i do [Music] yeah i'm playing this on normal difficulty [Music] a ball stampede it's still not like that one still does the most damage though doesn't it the wolf is the same ball back up back to where we came earth here we go we're so close to the end sit living wine the island of alumnus near the place of my birth lamb knows to a journey's end really smells like rotten eggs is it still good possibly yeah why would you do that ah it was part of a smile there part of a smile father why did you leave your home and come here does it have to do with the other gods there it's just you hate the god so much but cheer proves that gods can be good and you're good you only killed those deserving right yes ah but who's worthy enough to judge quiet head we are we know better ah sounding more like your da by the moment [Music] i think i'm gonna like being a god it's not all that it's cracked out to be we do what we want and now we're gonna go see the giants aye having learned that travel room to youtube we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak and put that magic chisel to good use nobody's getting in our way this time come on i'm gonna tell syndra i'm a guy i'd like to see the look on his face no i may have kept your secret too long but now you will keep our secret why should we hide what we are secrets are on his way shouldn't we be open like here dear kept secrets too for good reasons to protect people it is wiser to be discreet that doesn't mean you should lie to your friends or your family i'm sure sundry would understand and do the same lad excited to finally see the land of the giants yeah but also sad the journey is almost over oh what if we get to jodenheim and there aren't any giants there either makes little difference to us fulfilling your mother's wish is what is important ah oh don't go anywhere be with you in two shakes father can i tell him no tell me what doesn't he know anyway did you put this wheel in your mouth oh god i'll vomit i'm not kidding i'll throw up on it it is nothing a family matter oh oh i can tell you a thing or two about family matters oh let me guess your brother isn't as talented as you and his work is junk um those things are accurate your point it's all you
