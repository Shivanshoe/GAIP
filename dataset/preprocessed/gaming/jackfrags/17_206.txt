hi everyone and welcome to some riders republic really enjoyed this game just a nice chilled out extreme sports game i have already done a few videos on this but today we're going to be doing a live stream for about 3 hours and 45 minutes chilling out chatting with you guys if you've got any topics anything you want to talk about games life youtube whatever it might be let me know in the chat and also a big thanks to epic games for sponsoring this one if you pick riders republic or any other game up on the epic game store do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that and the game is also linked down in the description below so today we are playing in 4k i have turned the ui off as well i might turn it back on for like some specific races i can hear like what is that noise is that birds or something what are these birds doing i've just unpaused and these birds are going crazy are they bats maybe they're bats there's batman over there i don't know but welcome guys thank you for coming along if you're watching this live appreciate you being here if you're watching it as a vod thanks again and do consider leaving a like and a comment there's a lot of events that i haven't done so we're just going to be chilling going around the map doing the various events and just seeing how much we can get done really so there are all types of different sports in this game i've started doing them on the elite difficulty as well because i've been playing this game loads trying to get like perfect runs those are the videos that i've done so far where you're playing first person and you do a little perfect run of something you know i just think it's cool turn the hood off see how fast you can go was it christian oh yeah also um i've got five codes to give away epic gave me five ultimate editions to give away so we'll be dropping those codes in the chat at some point over the next three hours and 45 minutes so if you haven't got this game you'll have a chance to play it i miss that star i was looking at the chat i've not done this one before oh no way the dude just bumped me that sucks oh yeah also when you play without the ui you can't see the progress so i don't know how far into the race i am that's why i said i might turn it back on hit the boost these big jumps are really sketch as well on the bikes sometimes it looks like you've landed it perfectly but you just haven't oh my god that was close apparently there's another game that's like this called descenders but i've never played that one what's up king hello jay hey raymond good to see you guys what's up spoofy can i buy cheats for this game i don't think so a2g i'm not sure how you would cheat at this game to be honest maybe make your bike go faster or something i don't know so i just wanted to start by doing all the new ones there's quite a few is that a that's a wingsuit one so i'm quite inexp can't ride okay we'll do that one it is the same make as a steep yeah descendants is just bikes my ted okay limit jump height stay on the road as much as possible okay and we'll put it to expert just because i haven't done this one before good for you yeah you're good for you what's up chris hey playstation gameplay so your username on youtube is playstation gameplay what does that mean oh it's on the snow as well snow really affects how your bike handles the speed of it the turning circle ruins everything basically you gotta try and stay away from the snow oh we've got a tight turn here we'll be doing some of the mass races as well i think they're 32 and 64 players a bit of snow there slowed us down trying to boost gain as much ground as possible into second place i think this race is nearly over based on how long we've been doing it so let's see if i can take first get out of the way try not to miss any of the checkpoints if you miss a checkpoint you have to backtrack whoa that's a big downhill moment easy does it that's the only problem with being in first though you can't see everyone in front of you and know if you need to slow down or you can speed up okay that's the finish i think they're right behind me though we did it boom what's up moose whisperer are the keys just going to be dropped into chat yeah i'm attached i'll just say i'm going to drop a key now and then you'll see it pop up and it'll be first come first serve the graphics is sick yeah deep sea we're playing this on pc 4k maxed out graphics a brand new bike i think we unlocked some stuff a couple of new bike races there this is not the new battlefield john do you press a button to pedal captain cupcake hello by the way um you just have to hold right trigger to pedal and then you press lb to boost but your boost has a limit if i had the user interface turned on you would see it so you boost charges up over time you use it and runs down charges up again when you don't use it hey ian i'm doing well thanks faisal i'm just a bit um i'm a bit snowed under at the moment i've got a lot of stuff to do lots of work to do but i much prefer being busy than not working so i'm happy you know um lots of stuff going on this week behind the scenes and also big video tomorrow so look out for that what the hell a guy just blasted off there team rocket um yeah so i mean i'll show you guys the the options here so we've got this in 4k um got a slightly higher fov as well just because i like to play a higher fov on pc and then we're just all you know maxed out as high as it can anti-aliasing is low though because you don't need a lot of anti-aliasing at 4k and if you apply it depending on what type of anti-aliasing it is it can give you a big performance hit but typically speaking this runs really well at 4k what's up andrew will you be playing forza horizon 5 yeah yeah definitely that game looks great i know some people have already had early access to it but it's out soon so we'll do third person for this get to the next race yeah 60 hertz elijah my capture card only does 4k 60. as far as i know there's no capture cards yet that will do 4k 120. so that's why it's 60 hertz i do have a 120 monitor but capture code only does 60. it's fine for 4k to be honest is the game hard i wouldn't say so store lag also you can pick the difficulty so i'm playing on expert difficulty here that last race was and i won that first time first one was elite didn't win that one [Music] let's see what we got oh we got the the bike roller coaster i call it it's really easy to mess up these jumps as well if you're not going quick enough or you go the wrong angle you can get bumped as well by the other riders which is really annoying but there should be a mass race coming up soon and we'll do that they can be really fun that was weird i thought i was that player and the game had just messed up and put me in third person for a second i'm so used to racing in first person though is that a lap there no don't think so oh look at this we oh no i'm off bit off center there i don't think i'll be able to get first on this one unless something crazy happens so when you hear that little like sonic boom sound that's the boost first place is so far ahead there we there's a little palm tree thing there what the hell is that oh that's a laugh [Music] damn okay so there's a chance maybe i can claw this back let's see how we do let's first first messed up then it's a very scenic game as you can see lots of really cool landscapes i just took a different route there i'm sure is there a shortcut there that i didn't realize maybe there is let's go back a guy's name oh dear we are they're off track goodbye no they're back it is skidding there back in second okay this is starting to remind me of breakfast now where they cross hit the snow there that's bad i think you can create your own tracks as well not in the sense of like grand theft auto where you can edit geometry and stuff i don't think you can do that but you can put checkpoints down so you could ride anywhere in the map and just press the button to put checkpoints down as you go i've not done it yet so i don't know what that experience is like and that's where the first one off and that i think there might be a better route there that i'm missing don't think i'm gonna catch first try and boost as much as i can hey chef i'm doing good thank you how are you it's kind of like a gopro isn't it that's what it reminds me of there's so many cool videos on youtube where downhill bikers where the gopro do some first person biking down some insane tracks but they look incredible so dangerous though some of the stuff they do and that's it it's the end of the race second place i'll take it win and land a suicide what was that okay so the little challenges there for the race interesting hey dre can you do a backflip yeah you can i'm not i'm not doing tricks here though i'm just trying to race i can show you some um some tricks though like i've not really done it that much so on you can do tricks on the bike on the skis snowboard um that's how to not do a trick just wanted to show you guys that first you know there are races individual races for tricks as well like trying to score the most points do a barrel roll that's no defamation as well i love that that's cool you just drew any figure of eight i haven't seen any new world gameplay i actually streamed a bit a new world on twitch i played it for 20 hours did a dungeon actually did two dungeons there's a wacky shack daddy event in yosemite where you get to scoot around on a delivery bike keep an eye out for it sounds good yeah i played it for about 20 25 hours did a war did a couple dungeons and then i just got really bored of it i i just it didn't there's a wacky shack daddy event you literally literally just said that on a delivery bike you literally just said that yeah there wasn't enough variety in the uh enemies in new world in my opinion what a great day i hope the slopes are treating you well this is ridge radio making you feel good to be lost in the right direction the bosses were kind of just bigger versions of the ones that you fought already anyway find the small path from the chapel it'll lead you to some pretty cool fights that's also how i get to events i just land my car zip around come to get those pizzas delivered in time what the hell hey doc [Music] i don't want to be a i'm dumb it's domino's then i mean can i just do it in any order what the hell what's going on this is some random random italian dude i think there was three checkpoints over here i wish i could speak italian oh i drove it to the bench excuse me [Applause] is there anyone over here oh over there i'll go through this one who has this many pizzas by the way i mean it's an insane amount of pizza oh they disappear i think they disappear i don't get this one oh no i'm trying to jump over can anyone speak italian in the chat and maybe if i had the ui on i'd see what this guy was saying probably be translated or something yeah chat pineapple on pizza what do we think now i know i could start world war iii right now that's not my intention [Applause] margarita [Applause] [Applause] anymore did we get them all i should have turned the uh ui on for this one guys no i mean most people are saying no i see i see a few yeses in there though blando strong pineapple on pizza is decent strong [Applause] apparently there are some left i mean i am literally in last place as well i'm not good at delivering pizzas let me tell you that this one will be the finish i think the next one see i've tried pineapple and ham on a pizza um i would never order it let me let me say that i think there are much better options i would never go to a pizza restaurant or a takeaway and say excuse me can i have ham and pineapple pizza i just wouldn't i couldn't bring i couldn't bring myself to do it you know there's some floating goggles there look at that if someone orders it at a party or something i'll have a slice never order it myself yeah i feel that way as well like if it was in front of me and there were no other options and i was hungry yeah i'd eat a slice for sure but i'd never order it no no no pineapple and banana oh my goodness that's crazy that's quite tropical um that's just reminded me of something you know when i was very young in the uk we have a supermarket called asda still still around today although walmart bought them but many many years ago when the teenage mutant ninja turtles were popular they did branded uh turtles pizzas in the store at the delicatessen and i remember they did one which was chocolate it was a chocolate pizza and i loved that so much i thought it was so good and i think i was about six or seven at the time but man you know one day if they bring back the chocolate pizza i'm i'm here for it essentially it must have been just like pizza base and nutella spread or chocolate spread or something and when you're like six that's amazing i don't know what kind of dude i'm just trying to drink my tea here okay you get a better much better understanding of things when you put the user interface on yeah but you know one day if i go to a supermarket and i see the chocolate pizza's back and it's it has to be a time though with super sorry with the teenage mutant ninja turtles i'm buying it i'm gonna eat the whole thing oh wow okay i messed that one up didn't realize i had a left turn there i am all the way at the back now we i love the lighting at this part of the map that's super cool oh this one just flying around in a rocket it's a notebook lots of uh innuendos already okay we're changing now it's rocket time [Music] i haven't got much practice in the rocket thing we are going round and round and round you can actually click the wooden parts there too so you got to be careful as i almost did it okay you see the boosting there if you wanted to know what it looks like need a better line than that oh no mister too fast oh no that counts back on the bike let's go [Music] we'll do this one in third person that guy's copying my clothes [Music] oh that last uphill bit though what the hell okay you could easily fall off here oh no not the not the left oh i crashed a few times then that was good fun though this game that good it's really fun too i really enjoy it it's just it's a nice chill out game where i can just play you know i can just play it for hours doing all the different events and stuff [Music] i think you just killed a man yeah i think so too jack have you seen the american chain that's been opened up here recently cinnabon um there's one yeah there's one near me actually nipple there's one that's not too far away from me i've had cinnabon in the us though i've had it in florida can you shoot people down marshall there are no guns in this game but yeah we're playing on pc with an xbox controller all right we're going to drop a code in the chat now this code is for the rider's republic ultimate edition on the epic game store big thanks to epic for giving us some codes is the math race up now yes is it usually it pops up oh it's over here yeah we'll do this one challenge in sequoia forest will provide a massive hit of adrenaline as you take on the big trees a massive head of adrenaline potential keep pushing keep pushing that's how you drop into the checkpoint right there with style it should match me you can put me into a mass race hey hob pc [Music] oh these are all real players usually you see someone who's green i don't see anyone green or you see a duck there's a duck [Music] i mean it's chaos and there's a unicorn dragon i guess [Applause] he's just doing mad tricks on the snowboard what the hell rocket skis i didn't even know i had those off track funkies that's a grab isn't it [Music] one foot double grab oh you can just about do that from stood i mean it's just absolutely mad hey casual norwegian yeah i'm doing good thank you how are you here we go first round here we go so i've only done one of these i've tried to avoid them but this just gets crazy like you can bump each other around as well [Applause] here we go i'm at the front for some reason get ready to go bananas i don't want to go bananas oh no oh it sounds like a horde of angry bees is assaulting me oh you dab on me it's full guys we're on a bike oh no awesome oh no oh i nearly went off there i don't know where i'm going here angle's okay i'll take it no oh dude i'm trying it's just it's too fast and furious and i don't have any family hey does this switch to rockets now okay i don't know whether i should stick the first person for this or should i change you can easily hit the trees as well is it i don't think it is mate i'm not seasoned enough with the oh we're going under oh oh that's awesome i love that i'm not seasoned enough with the rocket pack need a bit more harry perry or cajun on top some salt and pepper i just like bikes and skis i don't like flying around like a turbo squirrel okay bikes nice final switchgate let's go whoa some guy just eaten himself off the edge there ah close this is an awesome race no okay i'll take it first time seventh let's go oh so there's another two stages now not bad at all nice work how many points for that 57 oh anything could happen next race i could be first i could be last might be 35th how old i am fast and furious bike edition yes indeed would love to see a forza stream don't i'm too much of a scaredy cat i'm afraid i can ride a bike i used to ride bikes when i was younger you don't want to miss all the noises that jack makes virtually mountain vibrating into the next round oh no this doesn't look good we've got skis rocket wing and explosive toys [Applause] okay right i'm gonna mess up on this because i tend to go too fast on skis and then time to bring it there's a corner that i just can't i can't get around i'll be honest with you i can't see a thing it's really difficult to see where the trees are when you've got 58 orange people in front of you you know wow i didn't i didn't see the fence ruined time oh different skis oh that's quite a tight turn that one luckily you've got the left trigger as well so you can just quickly change direction if you need to it's like endor every time in the jedi but there's snow and there's no ewoks and it's not as fun think about the children dice think about the ewoks try to stay in the mix high speed low drag high speed low drag do you think i am okay i've done this stage before i remember this from the beta and i'm not very good at it we've clawed a few places back there let's see what you can bring to the second half careful of the trees whoa give me more boost oh my god i hit the top of the tree just got put in the cabbage yes just got put in the cabbage what does that even mean just got put in the cabbage no one says that who says that is that like a snowboarding time to push it just got put in the cabbage i'm really confused bye these keys are really fast that just going backwards like a boss oh see ya maybe not like a boss final switchgate ferocious yeah it gets close to the ground isn't it this is where i hit the trees and then at the end there's like these yellow squares there's one there no no no no no no you can hit those balloons and they ruin you if you do i suppose you could fly through the middle oh my god i thought i thought i was clear right well this hasn't gone anywhere near as good 10 seconds that's the last one and even that wasn't great i was one away i feel the pain inside of me i was like what 23rd or something finish this time pick up the speed on the next 22nd you still get 43 points over that who's in the lead hoodie retro 128 points so they came first both times pro gamer right there stop pulling cabbages from a kid's story okay final push this is the last round the tree actually made you flinch it made me die inside a bit of gay gear if i'm honest with you [Applause] you recover more boost when you're not accelerating i didn't know that oh my god how is that dude on a snowboard can you just can you change i thought this had set rules that doesn't make sense man i kind of wish you could turn the voice off i mean this is nice and open hunt down those riders baby that's the only thing about the game i don't like that guy's voice we're back on bikes my preferred mode of travel go go go go go go go go go go go oh no no no no no no no no no no oh no lost a lot of ground there all right you're halfway here and chase get out of the way mouse or is it an elephant i don't know hard to tell oh this is quite perilous indeed nice final switch get reached okay we're in the business end pick up in a shred yikes damn that guy is so good i think it's the same guy again that one oh damn it that was so close i would have been like what tenth then maybe if i didn't mess up i think i reckon that guy won again you know it was like way better than everyone else keep riding ryder a furious one that one they've got oh my god they've got 1356 stars that's mad i only have 134 that's it isn't it for the mass race i think good work but there's room for improvement 13th pain that was a cheat clencher yeah it was blando what's up zunken how you doing what the hell was that dance it was like the office we need warzone content george there will be warzone content when the new vanguard guns are in and when the map releases and that's what second of december something like that well boom check these spectacular events just nobody like what does that even what does that even mean tacular come on dude snowboarding on grass that doesn't make any sense some weird noises yeah there's not much going on in warzone until the new stuff to be honest i did a video the other day looking at the details of the new map and that did really well um so there's you know i know there's a lot of people who watch my channel that do just want to see warzone content and that's fine but you know i'm not going to play the game when um there's not much going on if it's a bit stale for me you know if i'm not enjoying it i just won't do it uh cookies thank you for becoming a member i think we did get some more before i missed them i'm sorry guys we got some donors come in can't see the history on youtube for some reason usually you can that's a bra moment some dudes children's research hospital good to see you in the chat snowboarding on grass is not pentacular no it's not so do i i just have to get a good time for this one oh my that's like a roller coaster what the hell i love the races like this though they're so cool i'm gonna put the pedal down yikes square it up i think we were one second off gold there oh one second i can do this you're listening to wendy smiley on bridge radio oh one day wendy please think about the children again oh my god there's no loop the loops in this game sadly i wish there was would be awesome to do the loops have i messed that up keep it straight let's go we did it that was close i think it was one second faster 57 yeah 157.554 that's still the silver is it that counts that's fine there's a cougar in the car do you mean i mean there are some animals in this game are you talking about the other definition of a cougar thank you rosa got some donuts coming in what you've got donuts no i don't have any donuts unfortunately we're going to drop another code in the chat here guys hey study what's up the main man stodjalon is here everyone say hi to stodd start is definitely pimp tacular as they say virgin river run using wings to take on zion's ultimate enduro trail i have to say like that oh in the desert bing chilling yeah yeah yeah i don't know what that means again stodd is probably using some kind of snowboarding lingo here i'll close in the chat now first come first serve redeem it on epic game store hi stodd hey telbo yeah we're streaming in 4k tube so it should um should look pretty good cheers from rio de janeiro what's up mariano how you doing man hey shark i mean that guy's just gone straight off yike oh my god ruined i have to restart that one i can't be doing i can't be doing with that hello from portugal pedro what's up good soup off again pog frags stomp pog i don't like it and there's two laps of this as well oh no oh no no no no no dude you nearly just annihilated me oh that was cool i think i'm going too fast nice dice nice we talked about this don't we there's no time for tricks i don't know what i'm doing there i've got pink boots on hold on i do sign up for this a balloon maybe i can come back from this now with this being a lap i think it's just going to go straight back up to the top here isn't it it's going to be a really slow ascent back up to the top that's where i get him i'll get him on the bike restart now we're gonna restart and they went for the started there i need to figure out like the best way to manage the boost on that i feel like i'm not doing it effectively that's why i messed up last time isn't it same place oh my god i don't want to be in fourth guys i'm gonna be at least top three that corner is sick i've done it again oh what i mean the brakes are getting a workout you see here beautiful pink boots again close [Music] i think we're destined to fourth for this one guys sorry [Music] uh someone in the chat did say that your boost recharge is faster when you don't use the accelerator i don't know if that's true it kind of looks like it's the same speed but there might be there might be a little bit of a difference there hard to tell there's three laps i know that's the end now this is pod racing oh delete forever do you remember the pod racer game on nintendo 64. they also had it in arcades as well that was so good i used to love playing that i just like hardcored it on the nintendo 64. i just play that all the time i think i don't remember buying it first i think that we rented it first and then and then i bought it and sebulba was like the ai that was the quickest so bulba was just too fast and too furious hey paul is this canik chase the gay um yeah yeah let's go with you this looks exactly like comic chai so i remember all the desert and cacti there and the snakes and jaguars bears yeah oh those are kind of chase [Music] the arcade chassis was crazy yeah it was over it was massive wasn't it two it was two in one wasn't it i like the lighting sun's going down two laps on this dude stop bumping me look i can't help but not make that noise when i jump i think i played too much quake when i was a kid they just get ruined behind me then oh no oh then he went off the edge so gotta watch out for that the second time watch me forget crossover try again a few seconds there i'm one second in front [Music] that's an awesome track quite long eat i don't think you need to break on many of these hey this corners there though this guy is like right behind me started to get a bit wavy there like curly whirly what the hell this is where i nearly screwed myself isn't it oh man get control get control no i won't stand for it i mean i nearly i nearly lost full then managed to claw it back somehow [Music] jeez we got it oh second place was like right on my tail there when i nearly messed up hey royce if we get another music montage of this game i don't think anyone would complain yeah throw a banana pill you say why didn't ubisoft think of that they should have put the banana peels in hey i'd go this is like forza horizon extreme sports edition yeah a little bit alex workshop what's up man this game looks fine yeah it's good fun so marvin a little spicy yeah julian watching this on the plane home julian you've got an internet connection on a plane that's good enough to stream this are you kidding the so get dialed in see what ruffles your truffles at these next events see what ruffles you droppings are the dancers so get at them all right mate calm down i've used internet on the plane many times before and i don't think i've ever experienced one that was fast enough to watch a stream maybe in like 240p or something i don't know well is in the chat watch out open up it's jack streaming early access 2042 yeah trayvon on the 12th i'll be streaming it oh airplane mode airplane mode or are you on an airplane i'm i'm confused hey obi obi john kenobi what a g what a great name i'll put it back on the late neo the live streams are helping me forget about the coroner who's giving me lol thank you um neo i hope you get better soon hope you feel better give us a hint about the big video tomorrow liam i can't i can't say to share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable to make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength right red bull hardline battlefield hardline it it's uh the video tomorrow um if you watch my channel regularly you'll like it that's the that's the only hint that i'll give my name hard by nature beat the club for the faint-hearted only the best and bravest come here that's because it isn't about competing against the other riders it's all about competing against the course itself that's quite steep no features huge jumps 216. well i'll be streaming vanguard yeah yeah i'll stream a bit of time god for sure oh this is awesome i love courses like this it's a roller coaster ruined i was going way too fast on that roller coaster there vertex i'm watching from my desert villa out in the ocean somewhere that doesn't make sense but that would be cool right you've got your own island that floats in the sea and you've made a desert on it with a villa complex i'm into it you sound like a james bond villain if you actually you know if you actually put that into practice and did that all right okay that was a lot easier that time man i wish i'd have found this cool sooner i would have done a video on this i would have put it in that montage that i made this is a neat course no that's it's not there's no there's no time to be there's no time to be doing tricks jack that's a big job how many courses are in this game there's so many it's not it's just the break and the trick at the same button that's another thing i don't like actually i wish i could change that [Music] oh my goodness [Music] there's more this would have been a great course to do this actually looks like one of those proper like gopro povs this is going through the woods as well [Music] this is chaos i love it oh man that was awful who 28. did we get another go what the i just died [Music] here we go again yeah 434 [Music] almost didn't have enough speed there to go with that jump we that is horrible you can hear the you can hear the the bite scraping on the bottom needs to go back further than that i think [Applause] there's no way i'm gonna get a good time here such a cool track though this week [Music] i would love to have designed some tracks in this game ruined i think that's one of the biggest jumps i've done in this game way too fast gary but eating their fries [Music] you shouldn't eat another man's fries and that was worse than the first time uh josh thank you the five at home with the covert test positive today only lost my taste but watching your stream is helping uh josh sorry to hear that man hope you get on the mend soon [Music] hey kid you did all right remember though cheeky cheeky little wall ride that's right lincoln getting on up and making that win happen yourself if you sprint downhill off a jump do you go into orbit maybe neil maybe maybe that's what happens exploration take a flight to canyonland that sounds fun okay we're right at the top here never touch a man's fries confirmed there we go that's how we do the event are you using a controller yes charlton i am will you give tarkov a try again it's so much fun i don't think so neo to be honest with you unless they do like a big overhaul or something like i don't see myself coming back to it being totally honest with you uh lincoln thank you for the nine months it's a youtube member baby now we do we we've had twitch babies in the past but youtube member babies there's only a few of those pimp tacular leonardo are you vaccinated yeah i am i've got the pfizer hey anders what's up edgar smooth i was watching um aculite play uh a game called crab game earlier which is squid game someone's like made like a really cheap oh my god i've not really done this before so i don't know what i'm doing someone's made like a really cheap knockoff of squid game on steam free to play called crab game use this slow mode to slow down your fall and it was hilarious actually wasn't bad apparently though there's some um there's some issues with it where if you're the host someone can get your ip address and ddos shoes so i'm not sure i'd want to be the host so do i just go look like low to the ground you get points flying close to the ground oh i'm a wombat i don't like that heartbeat i have become one but fear me oh i can go faster i didn't realize i could press right trigger that's cool man i want to do more of this okay now that i know i can go faster i you know maybe we'll do better on the next one imagine this in 2042 well that's like what sundance is right like you can just fly around everywhere why is it a cheetah i think it's a cheetah skin isn't it i like that event that was good dodge trees closely same dose as forza uh don't think so check these spectacular events just you need to stop saying pimp tactics if these don't make your liver quiver i'm not sure what will if these don't make your liver quiver i'm not sure what will please let me turn that off i'm begging you snarfing the nerf in the powerpoint they just say random things only who knows who even knows what it means nobody knows it's provocative [Laughter] reach tv lucky straight did you ever think you'd be streaming an action sports game not really but it's really it's fun i like it so and it's on the epic game store as well so it's a game that i can pick to stream have i played the crew too yeah a little bit not much i played more of the first crew hey ma i'm doing good thank you i don't dude no fast and hard racing with nowhere to hide bridge tv's lucky straight downhill mayhem gutsy riding and a loud crowd a loud crowd eh i think i've done this one i recognize this game please yeah i've done this one before this is a cool one though a little too fast there maybe try again do i crack my knuckles no and lloyd thank you for the fire that's very kind of you hold on there was another one as well wasn't there um last order thank you for the five what do you mean jack that's how the youth speaks now maybe you're right maybe that is how the youth speaks now [Music] how can you stream in 4k i love it cycle almost like this thank you cristiano ronaldo manchester united and portugal footballer i'm glad that you can watch my stream in 4k thank you for being here how can i stream in 4k i have a one gigabit dedicated lease line which means that i get one gig download and one gig upload i also have a 4k capture card um which does 4k 60fps and i have a streaming pc with the nvenc encoder which is the nvidia encoder and that can encode 4k at 60fps at a 50 000 bitrate with no drop frames and that's how i do it so you need um you know a lot of tech you need a good internet connection uh you need to do a lot of testing and then you can do it i don't know i still don't think there's many people streaming in 4k on youtube like i think i'm one of a few that's doing it i think i needed to hit the boost there okay youtube has what the hell was that youtube has really great encoding as well are you yeah basically you can stream at much higher resolutions and bitrates on youtube than you can on twitch [Music] hey matt all i can say is that's pimp tacular thank you nick i feel like pentacular is now the hey don't get salty the word of the stream skittles and beer i wish it was sometimes you gotta let the chips fall where they want to fall that's right bro bro tacular can you do this in real life yeah you can do things like this in real life would i ever do it no would i advise it no is it incredibly dangerous yes you might die yes does it look awesome yes it swings in roundabouts i've got this white t-shirt on all of a sudden okay paul deal thank you air that's very kind of you sir john i'm streaming this in 4k on a 75 inch tv from california that's awesome dude yeah it should look pretty good on a big tv this youtube's quality is butted when it's evolved that's not true danny if you do 1440p or 4k it looks really good i've done plenty of streams in 1440 and 4k and they look great as a mod what is this track i need more g fuel i mean you're just trying to not die this is all this track is i'm not against it it's interesting are these big trees i kind of wish you had a map sometimes oh crap just so you can see what's coming up no no no sounding like a cat yeah i'm not snow i'm worse enemy i'm like this tree come on i can catch you doughboy i can do it i'm just going to channel my childhood days of f-zero x uh he's too fast too furious unbelievable that's fun uh philly thank you for the five i live in the alps right downhill bikes and ski powder myself i love that this game brings the sport to the more broad public love the streams philly that's super cool to hear that man thank you uh joel i've done thank you for becoming a member jo lav if you want to get on the discord by the way now you remember go to jackfraggs.com discord and there's instructions on there sadly streaming with amd is horrible quality wise if you don't have a crazy 16 core cpu yeah there's no way i mean i've tried it like i've got the 5950x and i've tried streaming 4k on x264 this is quite nerdy but bear with me and it just can't do it you just you get dropped frames from encoding the stream stuttery you can't put out the same bitrates that you can with enven you just can't do it i've tested it many many times and also your room doesn't become a sauna because your cpu gets really hot like the nvidia gpus heat up a bit with nvenk when you're encoding on them not much though nowhere near the amount the cpu is here up that's fun jack's discord community is pretty great well you would say that wouldn't you but that's correct see you later on this boom check these pentacles no it's just before dragonflies it's not the next big competition no if these don't make your liver quiver no i'm not sure what will no i don't know how many snow events unlocked which car do i have in the streaming rig um 2080i ruined greg's yeah yeah yeah greg's is amazing dude greg sausage roll unbeatable unbeatable matt thanks for the five buddy mad respect if you nail this stunt challenge over in yosemite consider my liver quivering can you imagine your liver can't quiver can it your liver doesn't can it like spasm if it's not it's not well no val it's the truth i'm sorry cousin cletus what's up i'm changing my name to pimp tacular you go ahead and do that man thank you jolla rail entry what the hell is this oh do i have to i have to score points i don't know how to do this i have to do six more tricks that looks painful i think we need to restart this one don't we sb media why aren't you in a war zone tournament thank you for the two um i don't i don't really care about competitive warzone i need to practice this yeah i don't care about competitive warzone sp media like it's not it's not really a thing that i'm into just it's a casual game for me even though it's not really that casual why am i why am i jumping jarla thanks again buddy [Music] i don't think i'm ready for that cheater zone aim assistant it's right there why is it over here who quiver even liver it was right there it was literally right there what's the best way to crash land here funkies yeah oh no hey how dare you when i was younger there was the game on the nintendo 64 called 1080 snowboarding and i loved that game i played the hell out of that and it was actually really difficult to do a 1080 on it because you had to do a certain combo on the controller to get it it's weird when you when you switch to mouse and keyboard the sound ducks out for a second ozone equals one two three four five peaches interesting take their c-cline hey cameron just got on into bf1 and i've been watching your videos and absolutely love them thank you cameron [Music] i think i've got auto land on sam [Music] ssx fives yeah panda for sure lukewarm yeah i'm definitely excited for 2042. thanks for becoming a member tenney look all these people have played 1080 i bet it looks like ass now but i don't care it played amazing when i was a kid that game was the best this guy's gonna be very cold so you need to put some clothes on sir i think they actually did just put clothes on then as well perfectly time it's almost like it's scripted and i don't know what is going on here i think that's the dragon costume that's an ice cream van how do i emote [Music] x stomp air yes let's go no iron bye there is no emoticon for how i feel is this game really easy no i wouldn't say it's easy it's an arcade game though for sure it's it's very accessible why is ssx it was a snowboarding game on the playstation is there proximity chat yeah i think so on over but i've turned it off fine thank you they've got banjo out why they've got exercise bikes what the hell they're on pelotons this is unacceptable so what hey there's a green man cheer i'll give him a sarcastic clap i feel kind of left out that i don't have my own exercise bike how do i buy a pellet on looks tactical gravity is a myth that's not true if you fall from a great height you will die unless you have a parachute [Music] will youtubers play 2042 before 12th of november well they usually have a capture event for battlefield games when they launch tends to be a couple days before but i think if they did have a capture event then based on what's happened in the past from what i've experienced with 2042 the embargo will probably be when the game's out so i don't expect any early videos or anything like that all right where did i get i got was like 12th on the last mass race i can't remember ladies and gents right i can't see what i'm doing i just keep getting knocked around this mass race causing a storm just the way i like it [Music] a many people went way too fast i like her costume well i just stopped dead in my tracks then what even was that it's your workout so move it time to pick it up time to pick it up oh she had the full 1980s workout leotard boom now this is pain what the that's not how physics work bye am i just going way quicker than everyone else here what's going on that was the final switchgate look get out of the way move out the way oh boy no i understand the snow no oh i dropped so many places then because i wasn't on the snow how dare you [Music] friendly soul jack i believe this is fairly dangerous what do you think i would agree with you i think your assumption is correct not many assumptions are correct but your assumption that this is dangerous is correct this is chaos yeah it is dog you can remap the trick bones can you poops i might do that you can find the peloton under a christmas tree in the top right side of the map so you just go up and unlock it dear pink arrows a speed boost no no they just show you the way yeah you've got to try and stay on the snow if you're scared you don't think that's dangerous nighter another round are you invincible what is this look at that no [Applause] how do i get a solo win on warzone sb media okay don't drop hot go somewhere where other people aren't so you can go around loot crates maybe do a scavenger contract get your loadout when you've got your loadout do recons find out where the circle's going go to a building near the end circle hide in the building close all the doors don't open any of the crates hide in a room play the zone let people fight each other and then when you get to the last couple of players be very tactical and pick your fight wait till the fight is over or just about to be over and then you can engage you know you can be a scavenger rather than a hunter and then you know maybe when the last two people are alive listen out for it you hear him having a fight and that's your time to strike and that's how you win a solo the rock came out of nowhere i mean that's quite a a boring way to play in my opinion but some people like it if you want to get a win nothing wrong with that you play the game however you like just don't cheat if you want to get one kill so you can win the match that's fine you do that solos um tend to be quite campy but also um i would say the average kill death ratio of solo matches is a lot lower just because um the type of player that plays them and the amount of people playing them so if you want to win a solo match get up early in the morning i'm being serious by the way get up early in the morning like 9 a.m in your country cue it for a solo match and you'll have a better chance of winning because the skill based matchmaking will prioritize time weighted over correct match or skill so you'll just get a bigger spread of players in the game first person view sucks i love it mad max films neil how to win solos kill everyone else that's like special air service advice right there neil i love that i couldn't win a match a war zone and then i did well how did you do it i just killed everyone else sas be the best now imagine if this game had weapons atom um there was a game again nintendo 64. i really i really like that console when i was growing up called vigilante 8. i think it was on playstation as well but it was cars with guns brilliant i had so much fun on it and it only had local multiplayer and single player but like it was a blast get ready to go bananas i don't want to go bananas no one ever like asks how the bananas are they always want to go bananas but they never ask how the bananas are oh i got bumped what a day for a mass race yeah it was the same as last time isn't it yeah or maybe not maybe a bit different no it's the same this is tree again coming up it's trees then as i just crashed into a tree yeah i mean what happened then i just died mario i have become one back i want to find some more i want to find some more wingsuit events and stunts i enjoyed being a flying one but halfway it's still time to chase the pack now commentator it's over i'm never gonna win a mass race you need to give up on me it is what it is nice take this and stop it wasted mel i never played it aren't they making a new one i think they're making a new one all right final push tear it up and chase down those positions don't go that way i'm gonna look like you could yeah i think there's rooms they're making a new twist in melbourne ferocious we have a winner [Music] i can't believe someone's already won i've got 30 seconds left guys there's no way it's gonna go harder fast here take a few risks are you dice a dice said that they patched that they lied last 10 seconds there's no way just kill me now [Music] uh mineral thank you for the 16 months 16 months insane you'll nail it next time upgrade your gear what you can upgrade your gear in this game i didn't even know that how'd you do that i've not done it once so does that mean i'll just have a load of upgrades oh neil pilot wings dude pilot wings was incredible i don't like this unicorn thing can we not do not do that justin pearson jack what do you think about consoles not having 120 hertz if you mean on bf2042 justin i think it's a shame i think it would be cool if they add that down the line any day spent with you is my favorite day enjoy the tunes and keep riding those trails but i saw what the developer said on recessera and it just seems like that going to 128 players is way too excessive on the cpu plus you know they're running at high fidelity graphics so they just can't do 120 hertz yet would i like to see it for the console players yeah i'd love to i think it's a shame but i mean most people have 60hz screens anyway so tvs it would be nice it'd be a nice feature for people to have on console displaying hella cute skills over there all right listen up your first big event is just around the corner so use these events to master some more skills and before you skedaddle a quick suggestion while you're cruising the slopes check out some landmarks connecting with the mountains will help you renew your energy it's going to be important as you progress through the series they have a usb port in the mountains usbc maybe carmageddon yeah where's the wingsuit sure i would like to see the wing suits done that one no i don't want 3d map yeah pc can do whatever frame rate look at the hole okay we'll do that a bit sus but i'll go with it that sounds so good does it change season no there's a day night cycle you can just change it whenever you want though just client-side so you just change time of day like that i think the game just looks nicer in the day so i prefer that remember to upgrade gear i have to see where you do this um next reward so that's just what's coming up for me it in the start menu customize yeah yeah list i've not done any i didn't even know you could do this i've only got one wingsuit so how do you upgrade it all i can do is click on it how do you upgrade it you can't just keep saying upgrade you just get you get better gear i know that but look you see so these are the stats of the gear but i don't think you can actually upgrade it like some people are saying in the chat you can change but i don't know if you can upgrade it was it a meme the whole time look at the bikes yeah i've got loads of bikes i had the best one equipped i think i just auto equipped the best one let me trick bikes yeah i i always had the better one equip um all right then so someone also said that because of the equipment i shouldn't be doing it on expert and elite i should just be doing it on pro or standard so just go pro see how difficult it is i like a challenge though i don't like it i don't like it to be easy i am batman so it's me i'm sundance right now flying across the breakaway map in the snow i'm gonna land at objective b do a barrel roll on the ground i'm gonna get my vector out open the plus system equip a suppressor triple kill capture the flag and then gonna call in an m1a brahms on my tablet shoot a helicopter out of the sky then i'm gonna get blown up by boris he runs up to me with some c5 i would like to see the heartbeats it's basically this point system is almost die the more that you almost die the more points that you get [Music] it'd be better if i had a minigun i wish there was skateboarding yeah me too so i didn't get that many points there because i didn't almost die enough i did get a better wingsuit it looks like a spaceman suit it's a nasty uniform this is like training for sundance yeah yes we've got more wombats no i love that love that energy yes one bat navigate through a narrow canyon to reach the finish line i'm in you had me at narrow canyon look at me i'm a freak i'm the best orange wing bat you ever did see oh my tea went cold no it is called c5 in the game i'll sample it's not it's not called c4 in the year 24 i like that that's good that's just called the facebook you can get a paper plane for the wingsuit poor person the jack forget about putting codes out no era because i'm gonna put a code in the chat right now thank you for reminding me i didn't forget i promise good evening deadmeat how are you doing it looks like a convict's flying so yeah somebody's just come out of jail right i was in jail i stole a bunny rabbit and they caught me i got six months no probation time to bullseye some womp rats let's do a pimp tacular dive here expert you can snowboard yeah okay so i've got to try and score which means almost die that's it let me almost die [Music] oh my god this is horrible what i've almost died yeah i almost died almost fine one bat one back that was so close no no no the wombats fallen it's going so well [Music] that was edge of edge of my seat right there and then i ruined it i don't know why he's bragging that's terrible oh another new one boom oh look at this you are thriving okay listen up wall of windows over in bryce's waluigi is here it's a pretty intense event that will get you flying waluigi there are some challenges to help you practice trajectory at epic speeds epic speed shut up oh my goodness nice think about what you've done dice think about what you did where's my boy there he is good morning from malaysia hey carl what's up is watch dogs legion fun yeah it's fun getting elias sorry just um i just played the single player though i never tried the multiplayer yeah battlefield next week more rated you know it gonna be streaming it from the 12th 10 days what's nine days now in it because it's nearly the end of the second hey dylan dylan is it first but no you can play third as well dry if you don't ask the question you'll never know the answer if you never try you never know basically feels bad man welcome to bryce canyon ladies and gentlemen flying close to the terrain in a wing suit is exhilarating and completely life-changing and you might die i can't wait to see these girls playing some fly through i mean i mean that's a death isn't it i'm dead okay all right we're going to start that one again i've died like i've killed so many npcs i'm just glad that fall guy isn't real because if it was then i feel quite guilty you know not all the people that i murdered i missed that one yes okay we're going for this this is a difficult one we i am the womba trees trees death trees and death trees and death don't oh we got a second i thought that was terrible turn gore on i don't think there's gold crafter it's not that kind of game if it was that kind of game would completely transform it that was good fun i enjoyed that [Applause] we're going again how did i miss that i'm not very good at this it's quite exhilarating though when you go fast like that i seriously miss that you get a lot of control splatters republic second go not so good i think i'm maybe fifth or six well oh you get three i mean this is completely like open the game up for me now i i didn't realize how much fun this was nope squat i mean that's you know that's as dead as you can be isn't it i don't think you can get more dead than that no terrible one out of time did you find the phantom project on writer's republic they do that absolutely i saw that there were some secret doors those weird bats are back again yeah there were some weird like secret doors i was watching geeky pastimes sorry there is a lot to do in the game metalcore it's sundance yeah i'm just practicing for bf242 that's all take the high speed rocket and fly like a squirrel in and around the hoodoos time to lay claim to true epic i mean you don't give a reality rider didn't get much of an opportunity there to change oh god dice jack you can't blame everything on dice there come a point in your life where dice aren't to blame but for now dice please sorry where's the checkpoint and that's it nice fast and furious it's point radio i'm your host greatly to you he's actually sick i love this it killed it cool dead dead legs broken spinal column fractured everything's gone hey danson it's built on the same engine as steep i would guess so caleb yeah it feels like there's a lot of similarities right do's and don'ts who do's chase who do what's that one angel's ride alright we'll do that one then no problem whenever i see the name hoodoo it just makes me think of uh a guy called hoodoo operator who was uh he works at rockstar now on the um the video team i think he was a very talented video editor made loads of cool battlefield videos back in the day cinematics and montages trailers yeah he ended up getting a job at um rockstar which is super cool you might want to try this stunt challenge in the most iconic crescent zion i mean it's the badgers it's the the ba sorry cat can we just appreciate that he said the badgers nadjas [Music] i don't know what to make of it honestly jdt thanks for the two this game needs guns someone could mod it maybe but yeah so whenever i hear hoodoo i think of scotland because chris was scottish i realized that i hadn't i didn't really finish that point did i oh no i've done this one before it's awful you have to go all the way down [Applause] you have to basically try and stick to the center it's pain it's pain it's pain that's pain it's fine [Applause] i don't know how i got away with that one there's a wrath uh yeah hood is awesome really nice guy super cool that he ended up getting a job at rockstar as well jack how do you deal with haters um i don't really have that many to to be honest uh i don't i don't really look i don't really see it like that to be honest like it is what it is you know what i've learned is that even if you were like a perfect person and you helped everybody you never did anything wrong people would still hate you this so what what's the point in even thinking about it you know um that's the way that i approach it it's just like it is what it is i'm you know i'm just going to stay in my lane keep doing my thing keep making the content i want to make and people can say whatever they like it's fine it is what it is did i just run over the rabbit maybe i'm sorry um where should i go there was a there was a new one here wasn't there i don't know if it's that one that's got like a weird helmet on it funkies that's tricks though isn't it pain could do that one should we go over there dangerous dangerous that's all i heard dangerous also like this applies to real life as well but like people will form an opinion of you even if they don't know you you know they might just hear something in passing or meet you once and then just feel a certain way about you some like you some don't that's life you know that's just how it is where is this oh it's right there do that funkies it's awesome i'm really bad at the tricks though [Music] dodge your way through the cables of the gondola and show them who's boss oh yes it is a cool word isn't it dude bro not as cool as hemp tacular though obviously oh nice i made that i totally made that props to the team that made the map yeah totally no am i not maybe i should do that bit in first person also um with the internet as well everyone makes assumptions and uh you know they oh my do i need to be lower everyone makes assumptions and they'll like people will decide what they think what the narrative is let's say without without the facts or without knowing the facts just from their own assumptions but again that's life that's how people are it's fine i sometimes that comes from so bad at this sometimes that comes from like a lack of knowledge maybe it comes from ignorance maybe it comes from i just don't like this person maybe that's it in real life you're dead doing that stunt oh for sure yeah i want to nail it though i'm going to try and get this right that was perfect that was actually perfect do i watch any formula one yeah occasionally justin yeah well i haven't watched um is it drive to survive on netflix everyone tells me that's really good i just haven't got around to watching it yet okay i messed that one up for sure i'm gonna go underneath that you gotta go quite high [Laughter] right then oh it's just kind of funny watching him splat over and over again yes no no i don't like that it's gonna be quite cold isn't he look at him his discount code um no the codes that i'm giving away just for the game the ultimate edition of the game someone said this one was cool funkies i'll go do this where's my rocket snowmobile what's up archie [Music] gorgeous game isn't it graphics so nice do i still talk to x factor yeah yeah occasionally um me and brandon are good friends yeah we don't keep in contact that much lately but um you know he's doing his own thing i'm doing my own thing i'm sure that we'll be playing 2042 a lot if brandon enjoys it that is why is everything black and white i don't know is it supposed to be black and white [Music] yeah brown is a good dude all those guys from squad why is this like a a special race a filter or something i have to do tricks don't i that's like one of those perfectly cut screens [Music] i'll close it for everyone tell us i'll just drop them in the chat [Applause] i'm on the fence oh ground it no i couldn't jump across that would have been sick it's a retro arrest okay it's supposed to be like this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the gpu is dead that wasn't there was not enough there's not enough air there to do a backflip it's because it's from the past yeah so it's like we're in the 1940s that's good [Music] yes it's kind of weird no what even is that what that wasn't a trick i was just messing about in the air nailed it [Applause] i think there's another two there's another two attempts it's so dumb use trickster controls it's much easier i you're probably right but i can't be asked to change and learn the new control scheme broken back yeah yeah that's dead like that's fully dead when you like press on a point like that it should just should just give you it like as a waypoint straight away it's by the same people that made steam lawson uh we're gonna drop another code in the chat here this is the ultimate edition for the game hang on is that luke the loop what's that doing now did i not did that not work i didn't have the yellow thing i redeemed this code on the epic game store by the way spready is it actually called the spready everything's fine everything's fine what platform pc [Music] oh look at the lighting here it's got like a sepia instagram filter on it it's such a different vibe playing it in third person i find it much easier in first person and they just put an instagram filler on this haven't they that's way better no my face is flat here we go they're all in first person now and then nail this 110 we've got a big big race i've already gone really slow there dice we talked about this there was feedback [Music] and guys there's no bots getting the codes people are just quick i mean i think how many codes is that now four but if you got one of the codes just saying the chat like bots don't just randomly sit in twitch channels and instantly and then still codes it doesn't work like that i guarantee everyone that is in here is a real person that's got the code and activated it it's just that everyone's quick they just copy the code and paste it it's always been like this you know we've done it like for years with with con points with all sorts of games what this race is i mean it's just designed to kill you isn't it there's got me an optimal way to get through those we could have done better david i got the last code do i think there'll be any dice please moments in writer's before brandon there's been several already my man uh dpx got the last code slip you're not real that's a lie [Music] a bot wouldn't say that also you're a member what does it mean it's just a meme i think when people say that everyone's just quick yeah it's quite i mean you can do it quite quickly like the code comes up you get ready copy paste into the epic game store you've already got the window open you can do that in literally a second you can do that in one second so i do think it's just people being quick um but one cool thing though about these epic game store streams is that um you know they've been great to work with and basically said to me look whenever you do a stream uh whatever game it is if you want to do a giveaway just say and we'll give you some codes so basically every every week once a week we're doing like an epic game store stream and like i'll always ask for codes for you guys so there'll be giveaways like every week for whatever game we're streaming so next week next week will be bf2042 and i'll have a load of codes for that for the epic game store so if you haven't um i mean there'll be a lot more people watching next week so you'll have less chance of getting it but if you haven't got it yet might be an opportunity to get it uh the next time we do with the epic store stream which will be on the 12th i think but yeah they're super cool to work with really flexible i need to i concentrate going too fast through these things i need to just chill out and slow down a bit it's so tempting to just blow your way through this uh like this one's hard because you just go flying into it i think you need a bit of look like that okay a little bit of break in there that was better speed up down here i don't want to go over that too fast because i'll lose control here nice and straight that's way better way better [Music] what did we get finish under 324 i mean my third run was the best i think i could easily get gold on that if i did it again god save the queen oh we got a gold bike that's right val if you guys do get anything on the epic store consider using my creative code jack frags and i'll just get a percentage of the sale there are plenty other creators though who have a code it's not just me share the love you know spread the love around what is someone there christian he's one and only downhill track that sounds fun oh someone asked if there's music in this game so there is music but because of dmca and copyright strikes and content id on youtube i've had to turn it off but it does have copyrighted music on you see here there are some good tracks in this game as well it's a shame that i have to turn it off otherwise my stream would be chalked so um i can't i kind of wish that like youtube was different but the music industry has so much power on youtube that like it isn't going to change unless youtube strike a deal with like all the major music publishers it's never going to change because music and games go really well together especially if it's a handcrafted section of a game matched up with a piece of music saints row did that really well saints row two and three got the new guardians of the galaxy game i streamed that last week that's got some great 80s ballads in it just some really awesome 80s songs but because i streamed it i had to play with the unlicensed music off that the developers provided and i'm really grateful for that because it gives you the option to stream it but you know they they've matched up those songs with the moments in the game so you're missing out on that what's up hugh a good name by the way this is such a chill stream yeah it is that's my goal man actually nearly killed me this is cool there's no trees in the way for once what the hell that rocks though oh no ruined have i watched june no i haven't rook i can't wait to see it uh brandon yeah on release day so i think 2042 goes live in new zealand at like 6 a.m uk time or something stupid like that i don't i don't think i'm going to be up at 6 00 am maybe 9am we'll go live something like that oh you could go right there but yeah i'll be live on on the 12th sure how am i not i'm not getting enough speed there i gotta really gun it there i need to go quicker that's a benjamin this lobby is sweaty yeah it is i need to gun it so i can get across that jump sounds are great too all throttle here i think we've got enough speed i don't know what's coming up that's fine that jump is sweaty there we go what was that why it didn't have the time on it i didn't have the time on it oh it's one of these okay two or two i mean on that big jump i could jump if i'm going too slow i can guarantee it by just doing a little jump before hey tommo what's up i've got your dm earlier tom sorry but i was um i was just about to start streaming um i was watching acolyte i was watching him play that game and like it looks hilarious dude are you going to make a video of it tomographic in the chat ladies and gentlemen the legend himself yeah it's weird that the time isn't going i think it's broke it worked though did it under 230 so the um they actually rubbed polystyrene together to make the sound of the crunchy snow is that true tom um what i'm referring to by the way is um something we mentioned earlier i was watching aculite stream and he was playing with stone fogler promo and they were playing a game which was squid game basically but like a really crappy free-to-play version of it on steam hey looking pretty sharp out there red bull home run is coming up but first these next few events will give you an opportunity to test out some of that it looks hilarious though they're bomb check it out they look really fun probably you will do a video you lost your voice towards the end i mean it sounded very noisy tom i have to say it did sound very noisy accomplish welcome ladies and gentlemen this mountain town i thought it was hilarious to your life exciting downhill mouse races of the season well you start running i hope you guys are too what this is weird yeah um the first time that stone made a lobby ruined stone made a lobby and then they were discussing about voice chat it's called crab game yeah they were discussing about voice chat and they were like i'll leave it on leave it on it'll be fine and then like two or three people joined and it was just instant racism like the worst of the internet so they just muted it straight away i don't know if they ended up putting the voice chat back on or anything but yeah it's just some people man i hate that so much chatting go over each other it's going to be a nightmare to edit that video time i hope you realize the amount of stuff you'll have to move and cut out i'm sure it'll be fun though i'll subscribe i'll watch it well i am already subscribed i'm just want to let you know that i have subscribed and i have ding the bell can we win this one 70 percent is guardians a good game recommended by yeah colin guardian's actually really good it blew my expectations away it's got excellent writing i found it quite funny the gameplay solid the graphics and animations uh top tier aaa really good fun i mean i think you have to get over the fact that it's not the disney marvel characters it's not crisp rat it's not a zoe it's not batista it's not bradley cooper you know some things look a bit different some things narratively are a bit different how did i miss that but once you get over that yeah i think it's a really good game you can ding my belt any time tomorrow said wow well you know you don't live far away time so just saying i have a car [Music] those sounds are so good oh wow [Applause] no you can't make yellow snow in this and then press forward can you play this game multiplayer 1v1 you can play it multiplayer yeah or you can do solo you can do 64 players in the mass races get out of the way get out of the way [Applause] is that blue line the racing line was it just a rough approximation of where you need to be i don't know always mess that one up it's too tight now [Music] never give up let's go would you be able to hear that if you were going at 105 kilometers an hour wearing a helmet on this ski slope i don't know get it get it get it nope oh it's just too quick close call pole lines out of bounds hey chris what am i doing up so late i've just got too much stuff to do basically chris like sometimes you've got to try and fit something in even if it's late yeah because other things are coming in the week dang so much sauce your jersey clearly isn't made for inferiority congratulations lemon snow that's it yeah can you play this virtual reality no slim i don't think so are we in switzerland i don't it's just a made-up place there's all sorts of biomes there's forests canyons desert snow water oh my god bro i want to be i want to do um i want to do a stunt maybe that unlocked so many things it's just like i don't know how many hours you could spend playing this game it's insane the amount of content in it are there any stunts that i haven't done easy does it this is qc on point bringing you the fast tracks and the greatest brett nail facts ever the greatest one so here's a gem brett like me was in several punk bands before discovering fighters ridge how totally epic is that no oh this one i haven't done this one rocket squirrel i'm down certainly worth keeping a lookout for trouble with the capital t baby are there any more coz i think there's one more code left some more you love steve you had no idea this game thanks for playing it no problem michael crichton are you the famous author michael crichton of jurassic park fame what else did michael crichton he must have he's done way more way more books than jurassic park the soundtrack's good i just can't have it on the stream paid sorry you know one thing this game needs do correct me if i'm wrong if you can do this already one thing that would be great is if you could let's say you had a big community of players whether you're a casual gamer content creator streamer whatever you're in a clan if you could make a lobby like gta races right where you make a playlist of tracks with i don't know 20 people 30 people whatever and just go through that playlist am i right i feel like they've missed an opportunity there unless that's coming down the line i hope so that'd be neat imagine if we could like get everyone on discord and make a a list of races you know like marbles marbles on stream but ryder's republic on stream i'd love that that'd be great i see just gta races more games more racing games need to do what that game does all right amazing i don't know about that rocket here it's fun to just fly around in this thing i like the stunts i want to do all the stunts come on there what's that cloud flight like ubi does with chat mania yeah i guess it's kind of a similar thing how you do it crash and burn as you fly through the trees battlefield stream i mean you missed that straight away it's crazy do you think anyone will play battlefield from a hot tub i think that's a good i like well no actually unless you had a waterproof controller or something you might break your controller overshot that i think it gives you so much height because you wouldn't be able to do the rest of the course if you didn't have that height oh crap you should try real skydiving it's awesome i'm sure it is i don't think i would do it though i'm too much of a wimp i was going so well your beautiful butterfly yes same tree it came out nowhere i promise i'm gonna go right there we go should have died then three we got 69 nice i

please let me go quicker i can't go any quicker than that 2 23. oh they were right next to each other is this fortnite 2 bruh yeah it is this is 492. they just got ready the building and the guns parents complain too much about the guns and they decide you know what fortnight two it's gonna be an extreme sports game with no guns no building just sports it's in the game that's their new intro when you load the game that's right so it goes have i ever won a mass race no matthew i haven't i've only done it a few times i've not really done it much these these guys are probably sweaty tryhards who play it all the time time for some sapphires [Applause] what the hell concentrate concentrate victory requires patience the art of sun tzu get those chain rings working yes trying to stay in the mix i'll stay in your mix if you're not careful i'll cook you up a few cookies yeah i'll do it i don't care what kind of cookies you want i'll make any kind of cookie cinnamon raisin just oatmeal my chocolate cookie rainbow cookie white chocolate cookie cookie what i'll do it for you i don't care try me not like this dice i don't think i was even supposed to go that bit not going well started

watch my live streams they're in the business she did she'd be like jack i'm not angry i'm just disappointed and those are the ones that hurt the most i can't believe you've done this it was it was al yeah it was a really nice start quickly went downhill like many things in my life it's a good start hovering around the b range and then it quickly falls off a cliff f and then just f it plateaus at f so b b b b b b maybe an a every once in a while a a b b b b b b b ruined that's like that's my life pretty much mama frags gonna get out the frying pan if i was naughty when i was a kid they did used to throw shoes at me and it really hurt if i was playing up and being naughty they would throw shoes at me and chase me up the stairs especially my nan my grandma she was like really like she had an aimbot or something i swear aim assistance this is the last time [Applause] ladies and gents how are you supposed to see or do anything at the start isn't it just rng [Applause] no no cosplay no i think it does have crossfire what a day for a mass race time to race oh my god that's a rock didn't hit it somehow okay one awesome day to ride yeah my nan plays on controller jeez that doesn't make sense you've just hit you just killed me someone just ran over me and killed me just fly why isn't there a wingsuit mass race does it have one of those i'd love that do it you need to do it oh do you finish have you seen what position on my that's not the right angle of dangle right there do it what a day you just that guy just try and kill me i think he did yeah um no it's rockets it's always rockets i'm sick of it we are the winners i hate this bit come on let's finish yes i finally finished this one ah we did it reddit ready i just want to say thank you keep riding ryder it's been many years attempting that mass race just to finish that last section finally we did it see you later phil is this gay i'm playing on pc general cannoli hello there good work but there's room for improvement hundred pound i don't think it's a hundred pound delta isn't it sixty the standard version of games are usually sixty quid i don't know if they're a hundred if it's a hundred quid like that's too much oh my goodness we got some black boots check those out for the snowboard [Applause] hmm did you see the state of the new home alone yeah i've seen the trailer marcus i don't know man some things should just be left alone home alone is one such thing all right mate you want to go round and round the circles with me [Music] duck lock cool guy just afraid of anything yeah like ah the trailer like i don't know that english kid who's the actor the main the main character i don't think he can act very well before you're next it's like a pantomime remember when you're in the mountains live in joy because sometimes they won't invite you mr man jack i just wanted to say you're my favorite youtuber stream and keep up the awesome videos and content mr man thank you that's very kind of you you're my favorite mr man 60 pounds yeah i thought 100 quid doesn't sound right right show me the stunts please spike's down south that's the boy right there it's the vomit comet it's not a roller coaster ride it's like a disney plus thing right like they've got the ip now oh we can we can make this really easily we can make a new home alone make some money off it get people to subscribe with disney plus but i just uh i'd rather they just didn't make it you know it was good it might be good i haven't seen it maybe i'm being i think i'm being too judgmental but based on the trailer i don't think it's going to be good i don't think that kid's a very good actor i'm sure he will be in the future but kids generally like there's not many good kid actors there's that kid in um probably like a grown man now or a teenager there's a movie called room the kid in that he's excellent um there's a kid called asa butterfield who's you know he's grown up now but he was a very good kid actor i think he was in a movie called the boy in the striped pajamas he was really good in that um there's a movie called the florida project that's got some great kid actors in it good movie that's a bit bit depressing but real you know like that's why i like it um who else is a good kid actor the kid in um the kid in logan who plays uh weapon x oh she's great there's a movie that i've seen recently that had a really good kid actor in it but i forgot what it was what is this race by the way i mean what this is crazy yeah aza was an endgame as well sorry ender's game not end game i think he was in avengers he's a butterfield though he's a he's a big gamer he plays games and stuff what is going on i've completely messed this up the kids in it yeah that's true some of the actors in stranger things are very good i mean obviously they've grown up now like uh most of them are probably 18 now have you seen um what's the kid that played ellia in et he's been in a couple things recently that i've watched he he was in um dr sleep he's really good at that only in it for a very short time and he was in something else i watched haunting of hill house haunting the blind manor his audition for e.t is incredible there's a video on youtube where he's like reading the script or reading part of the script from et and he just starts crying and it is so believable and the the guy that's into the sorry the guy that's um interviewing him for the the job is just like you got the job kid like he's so it's so good i don't remember the actor's name is it charlie charlie something no henry thomas is that right so much to dig in the republic make sure to keep writing otherwise you'll become uncomfortable being too actually hate this one what the hell henry thomas yeah that's it yeah if you haven't seen that video just go on youtube and search uh et kid audition i'm sure it'll come up or like henry thomas audition is stream over no we're still going zucks we're still live i'm trying to do this stunt i need to go right here i need to use the brake mode as well splat it handles like crap in the snow the bike i want to go too fast because i don't really know after this bit loop okay we got it tree tree hey i'm gonna need some time for that one have i heard about the low level protection mechanic in bf1 no i haven't was that a bear swaggy swaggy right there i can just if i could just uninstall him just uninstall him that'd be great sorry you've been uninstalled from the game where's there must be more stunts because it was like 19 out of 23 or something where are the stunts i've done i've done these the red ones hmm do i just have to explore some areas not really been oh here's one yes i see you i think you can hide from me stun no no no no it was a tree disguised as a bear interesting probably all sorts of secrets on this map [Music] nice to be right in come on give me give me a bit of foreplay you know it's throwing me right in the deep end i took that completely the wrong angle did i miss that game did i don't feel like i missed that have i seen matilda yeah a long time ago though i thought it's a great movie paint paint pain hey gabriel love you too bro boy i forgot about that jack's gonna be so good at restarting stunts by the end of this yeah i can restart the studs so fast and the quickest drawer in the west at restarting the stuff there's no one quicker so me that was completely unnecessary whoa i love that race that's super cool go find the bear where am i look at me look at us get my instagram filter on oh yeah time of day a bit of a bit of rain maybe a bit of snow wetness maximum wetness and that brightness actually no no oh yeah you can change the depth of field as well dead nothing bob races i've already i've already done that one exploration i've not been down there at all i need the red triangle give me the red triangle do i see one then guys which stunts am i missing some up here maybe i think i've been up there i love it it's great did you play with acolyte and tomographic on this game no i didn't what's up jupiter how you doing a lot of locations are based on utah that's interesting why is it telling me about drifting i know how to drift so skis and snowboarders i'll just jump and fly down the mountain instead that'd be great go go go dead [Music] uh toby thank you for becoming a member that's very kind of you appreciate that i would absolutely love to see tomorrow and jack play this together i think it'd be a good laugh wouldn't it i could have won that one what's up artistic soldiers guidance and protection from jamaica what's up thank you for coming where is shoot there is no shoot big ben no shoot only race i need to find exploration memes guys i must do the stunts i've nearly completed them all could anyone get a map and tell me which ones i'm missing see these little red triangles here the ones with the star i've done abyss arena not been over there what bloody hell is this what's up steven from australia oh my god what uh it's a megalodon what is this it's just a trick park that's kind of cool i didn't mean to do that some of the yellow question marks on the map are stunts okay here for example let's go check that out uh it's a purple what there's another bear yeah i don't know what this is ow is the bear eating me come back there where'd you go hey ali uh okay that's a paper airplane wingsuit cardboard plane looking good more question marks okay those question marks it's a wingsuit uh a landmark amazon packaging plane you don't have rocket boosters on it though what's up ally yeah i do occasionally not all the time i don't watch it religiously um yeah maybe that's what i've already done right here wrong waypoint i hope dice is not getting any ideas from this oh my god la taro are you saying that i should add a rocket wing specialist to bf2042 is that what you're implying that's how you do it hey blue what's up can we get the last coast yeah we can drop the last code now so the code is for ultimate edition of this game on the epic game store i'm just thinking like surely there's one here because there aren't any other stunts here maybe that's one there let's have a look what did i not i not go to it i missed it maybe you're right at the top oh this might be a stunt no it's just an observation again mad respect if you nail this stunt challenge okay get to it because it'll push your proximity skills to the limit so i've just unlocked one i think so we'll do this yeah i was right there's one here somewhere where is it i don't see a new one i kind of wish that you could just go show me the stunts without having to go and find them all you know landing god yeah that's the only thing i'm good at in this game and also if i do a race about 300 times i can do a perfect run of it i thought it was going to show me one then oh for sure luke for sure for sure robot mad respect if you nail this stunt challenge over in yosemite get to it because it'll push your proximity skills to the limit see him saying that makes me think that it should have should have unlocked it but i don't see one they usually start quite high up as well it's a bear an eagle up in the top left hand corner of the map okay cool thanks i'll go up there we will go and see there's a question right there isn't there this one i reckon it'll be that one yeah that's up on the hill the hill it's a giant mountain jack come on can you land on top of this yeah you can but what's the point there's something here it should be like a balloon there or something to collect a star give me the stun little observation points shredders flankers borders and squirrels what i'm just gonna i'm just gonna fly there see what happens nightbot is taking all the codes yeah nightbot just harvesting chris playing on pc bobs ash i'm up late yeah i am i've got to be up early as well i've got to be up in um like six and a half hours for an event tomorrow morning so i'm gonna need some coffee for sure and this stuff over here yosemite tamarack flat oh i mean there's nothing here i would like to see the stone ship of the campus at this absolutely wicked shack daddy event we could check daddy of it is kind of cool to just explore the map to be honest huge oh look at this there's a course there or something shut up crow someone in chat just said instantly switch and then switch back and you get the boost refilled there you go duck clock oh so it was you oh yeah i saw you duck you were going round around in circles weren't you after the mass race stephen yeah i think all the codes have gone now we had five codes can i drive cars not in this no cars on this i'll plunk my ass down here oh yeah there it is all right this will be the last one that we do we and then i gotta go to bed hopefully this is a cool one to finish on let's go okay this one's all about navigating between snow and dirt in yosemite's most narrow corridor it is gnarly gnarly bro so gnarly yeah that's it's a great start driver's republic that's a different game here that's the one with the cars you can kind of use the snow to slow you down here instead of breaking it's gnarly brother oh no no no no no it's skateboarding in it no but that would be a really cool one if they added it bick yeah maybe i don't know if they've planned like dlc or anything but skateboarding for sure would be uh sick there is snowboarding [Music] skis is it and snowboarding [Music] oh my god what [Laughter] [Music] can't even see that dice i've got the i've got like the least experienced with the snowboard
