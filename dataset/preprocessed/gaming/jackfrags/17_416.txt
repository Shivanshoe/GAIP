hi everyone hope you're all doing well and welcome back to more call of duty warzone season two today playing with tomographic and study i will be jumping into the map maybe having a look again at the new areas the boat couple of the bunkers see if we can discover any secrets and we're also going to be using the new ffar build so with the patch yesterday a lot of the attachments got changed and messed about apparently there is some kind of a hotfix coming could be later today could be tomorrow who knows but it will fix some of those attachments but long story short if you are using one of the cold war weapons the attachments now do what they say they're doing and it's kind of changed up them the meta of the game a little bit so i thought that i would try out this new ffar jay god put out our video earlier this morning was a few hours ago and he recommended going with something like this so no suppressor you take the reinforced heavy steady aim laser i guess you could swap that out for something like the muzzle break maybe sas combat stock 50 round fast mag and the s fod speed grip and i've never really used the ffa i like this before so it's it's going to be interesting to try it out see if it's any good i'll be pairing that with the hdr here which is the classic meta hdr build but this will be interesting because i don't have a suppressor on it and obviously in warzone if you don't have a suppressor you're firing you'll appear on the mini-map that could be quite bad in certain circumstances but we'll see and i've also leveled up the new pharah assault rifle level 45 so i don't quite have everything for it but we're nearly there and then in a couple days maybe i'll do the new smg as well also today i do have some cod points to give away i'll be dropping those in the chat i've got ten codes to drop five for pc five for playstation and basically i'll just say okay we're going to drop the code and it will come in the chat whoever gets it first gets it and they're 2 400 card points each and if you guys do get anything from the store consider using my support creator code jack frags so we're gonna have some fun today i'll join up on tomorrow so you can get some matches thank you for coming along to the stream thank you if you're watching it as a vod i appreciate you guys leave a like it's a great way to help support me and subscribe if you know that we know that he'd say hello hello we're doing um jeremy clark's impressions chat okay but we've now stopped and we're playing stopped and we're playing a video game that we enjoy we are playing a video game that we enjoy we are playing a video game that we enjoy we are playing a video game that we enjoy this is a video game that we enjoy oh i've gone for the um the green rose skin today you will blend in it's like the reverse you know the uh the woodland effect yeah for blending we've all got quite dark skins don't we yeah but i do have a face that says shoot here in a dark corner so what the ghost mask yeah it's just bright white isn't it yeah but it doesn't really come up as bright white in the game does it yeah it does yeah yeah yeah you know if you see your skeleton your closet you immediately shoot it that's what i do so if i see a skeleton face i'm just shooting that's right skeletons can be nice people that's exactly what a skeleton would say jack hey have you not seen nightmare before christmas i've yeah it's a great movie you ever think about the fact that we are literal skeleton ghouls being controlled by a fleshy mass way more inside the skeleton way more than i'd like to admit stud you know we're basically puppeteering our bones around yeah disgusting it's odd we're just like we're a mech and we are just the brain like our brain is you can imagine our brain having little hands and feet like pushing pedals just move the legs when you want a little muscle yeah a little faster than that yeah underneath we're all the same we're all just born that's it the other way around uh apparently we could just be our skeletons could be controlling us dude no how though no it's just bones because they're magical what that's not grounded in reality though stud neither is warzone let's play it well remember there isn't a skeleton inside you you're inside a skeleton because your brain is inside the skull yeah that's fine where's your brain stopped mine's in a job five feet away yeah skeletons are weird aren't they yeah yeah drains yeah yeah yeah yeah [Applause] the first guys in my closet not anymore i shot it so i'm saying that's why tomorrow's skin is so easy to see start started with the same level skeleton um i have no idea block you actually block people from that menu you can you can block people from the party man hey ow yeah right click to pomographic study oh here we are oh my god oh my god i've never seen tommo's skin yeah i've never seen a skeleton and somewhere in the same room he knows yeah the flesh is just everyone's going to go to the ship aren't they it's good for lots of girls off the bat but at the same time if you want anybody don't really care about those zombies no i didn't care about jump leaking and mark the target sliding target right here any guns any guns um just the one i've just picked up i was uh daddy here i was already gone oh here come here sniping at me yeah relocating i think his buddy dropped in second floor where you can see the zombies on the map from this far away can you oh yeah you can what is that because that's going to like look like a uav dot when we have uav live imagine at some point that it's just the whole map zombies do you think it will be or individually those terminals are going to actually be yeah you have to activate a terminal i think [Applause] it's the park bunker yeah the park bunkers are what i'm curious about because you don't need the key to you need the code to get in there anymore but really also the monument is next to that hasn't gone like the other silo but they've opened up the back part of the park there's still crates here there's a new corridor you can go in there and it shows two windows though like they should open where's these guys going you have to show me that later because i haven't seen that oh that sounds cool yeah let's say he's decide i think he's on the second floor because he probably put it on the roof above it yes that is good it's probably active work relocating put a precision and he showed up on the mini map on blue marker i don't know why you put it there but go 3v1 you think he's on top do you i'm going to talk but one of you should probably check second yeah i'm coming with you i'm taking a second i don't see anything nothing absolutely nothing the claim was it's still there so he's not come out that door well it literally showed him on the map and he was on blue marker so i think he might be sitting in his rest he's rest at the uh by north west overhead is that his uav as well probably mark the target [Music] [Applause] we've gotten nearly enough to load out a bit more cash let's stick together i feel like there's a rat somewhere i don't know it's getting that vibe yeah i'm getting the right enough haven't we we've got enough yeah get to the bottom [Applause] i'm dropping on the bus i didn't help a girl no it did it did okay thank you please [Applause] [Applause] porto i can't see him anymore tommy's gone let's take hill yeah he's gone gonna go skin there's people up on the hotel i think yeah that is the best ghost skin i think tom it's good i know i like that he has a little a whacking stick but yeah you do have a massive cape that glitches out in first person and goes in front of your face all the time oh does it when you crouch sliding running around and play in that building we're going down there's no physics in in a first person so you just get a static cape in your face when you crouch like that right target right here that was close look at him he's still helicopter behind us target right here [Applause] the pen on the bottom isn't it i guess so yeah it's cold or sniper yeah well there's no fmj for the guns is there you can't put a perk on it so you know we have to have some fmj properties that makes sense sir everyone's dying and we're not there this guy here oh that's gotta be the rat from earlier got him nice it looks like a ghost skin i think uh no i don't think it was there's a guy with a helmet wasn't it then i couldn't see yeah it's one of the cold war dudes how the hdr is so good yeah so amazing better than the lw3 yeah i think so now yeah after the weapon nerf after the agency suppressor they are fixing that so you could do a quick video using the lw3 now it doesn't feel bad but it's just i'm i'm refusing to use them until they fix it but the thing is like there's not really a bad sniper other than the dragon off with so many of the other three you're currently at 40. there we go there's gone blue i'm getting you over something there's a guy in this building right here okay was he second he was running around there's also mine or something there yeah i'm a box i'm a box yeah this roof here are you pushing tom not all the way up just to this wall here okay he's ground floor i'm on ihop i'm on a train station electronics might be a good spot still running still running still going yeah he's here we'll get a live on him in a second nice there marked a target there's another one here somewhere though [Applause] no why is it did you down in tom i think i just saw one on blue yeah he's been on this uh van here doesn't have fries though careful [Applause] cool we could go get ghosts yeah i'm taking high alert as well now so yeah i think that's pretty good you think more people are picking it now hi look one of the the way i see it jack is like it's from a sniper you don't need it as much if you've got like an smg assault rifle that makes more sense and people don't really push anymore people kind of just like try and zone you out these days so being able to know if you're being shot in the back before it happens a ghost was good i'll break him down there he's got no no plates head back there yeah he's probably gonna peek and try and go for his gear that's what he's planning on doing [Applause] is that satchel though yeah yeah i think he's probably just run that way moving here let's keep them running away from us closing in he's a big fight going here moving the is this him forget this bouncer here probably a good idea come on my god is this one guy is that the same guy tom yeah yeah 100 [Applause] green girl oh right on me right here different team let's pick up an explain right cracks remember you've got that full team on blue yeah you guys it's a sandwich nice okay any more teammate on me [Applause] okay okay yeah i left it again from southeast south east harley landed on the uh yep okay just be careful on the buy station found him down jack that guy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i think there was two i heard two sets of footsteps oh that's uh that's a southeast guys again i'm gonna crawl in i'm safe here okay keep going okay yeah i can hear them moving around the other building fine oh my gosh you snapped yeah yeah but he's not the same guys like two in one if you're scrolling down the other building see them running around the bottom maybe pushing left my box is down arm is here yeah he's not peeking that roof anymore i can't hear them running around they're definitely running around on the side left here thank you uh what's this helicopter yeah he definitely landed there before okay it's flesh now though wait no it's a gun no it's there helicopter here time's up objective all right let's buy uav and stuff you got gas inbound relocated oh loads of cash here yeah yeah yeah there's a gas mask there as well i think we'll be going out he's got ghosts 100 right there jack i'm blue moving here i think he's going inside yeah no one on this back side and the door is open okay [Applause] plates yeah they suck nothing on heartbeats todd just whoever gets our stunner at first isn't it uh we got we got money got loads of money the the recoil on this new gun can be a little uh it's crazy well compared to the f horizontal isn't it yeah imagine trying to control that on console well it's definitely not going to be a console guys the trucking coming jack [Music] just helicopter here this is that guy might still be in the woods behind us todd yeah no no the trucks guys are fighting at the buy station ahead that guy kept on driving no wasn't there a one guy here that you nearly killed no i did kill that guy vehicle maybe they were someone just got in that truck he's gone fire station tom he's in fire station gas is here as well mm-hmm still a guy in this building as well head him this way you've got loaded up flying around it yeah i picked up mine bad spot there isn't it for me um do you need armor plates or anything enemy uav alright i'm maxed out thank you uh atv just ahead of us coming towards us see that yeah we need a better position here oh yeah one vehicle on the dirt bike looks like it oh i'm getting smart from elsewhere he's down there's another one okay you see his name relocating the safe zone yeah i know i know but i definitely just got highlighted from behind i'll respawn behind us here yeah [Applause] i don't see him good isn't it yeah around blue somewhere oh um the west where are you peeking me from there's i think there's someone in there on orange he's peeking me because i keep getting warning about it i'm in bank building i'm going to second floor the poop mark the target [Music] damn it do you want to get ahead of these they're waiting for us they're all here they're all here we need to move you might get stuck there tom i'm coming i'm coming clustered between them and the zone yeah blue building blue building 100 what's that double threat as well i think it's those guys that we're running now it's red threat we don't have cover we need to get ikea building i think it's not ideal remember we're going to be running into guys right now we're going to be playing our stuff right here jumped off roof right here right here [Applause] [Applause] oh god the whole server [Applause] [Music] are they on you he's on blue on blue i think this blurb starred no no they're definitely gone blue though okay rose skin steps to your right side yeah did he get around 31 meters direct oh man as long as they maybe shoot each other we gotta move against todd [Applause] right here gas [Applause] there was one team on the right of us remember probably already made it through here i guess yeah i see them you see my money map next to buy we could quickly hit the buy movie [Applause] right here right here on the left right pushing down hey mike then there's the guy on the red marker as well we can't go there ah sorry do you think he's on he's on the wall jack on that red marker nice he's hiding behind it right now dirt pile here we can use where we in there we're not in yeah not quite we're gonna be the ones in the open does he move okay no need to speak just on the house uh we're gonna have to take a ditch i think [Applause] okay oh god oh man this sucks dude at least they're fighting there do you have any bites no no enemy uav overhead you okay we're on that uav okay it's the three bts bridge this bridge i think it's previously one jack yeah still winnable left flank left and go around i did see people already that way but if we flank really far left maybe yeah we've got two people i don't know yeah yeah it's really far left and i think we'll come up behind a team that's already cleared this the only thing is if they're at those buildings they've got really easy kills on us yeah i think they're looking i think they've already moved ahead nothing on heartbeat yeah i've got a play boxer do you need it no i'm good i'm good serve it i don't know if we'll have an opportunity to use it though but whatever i don't really want to go in there you want to go even further left oh there we go we have to fight we have to fight we have to fight if that's right here right here right here creep creep relocating remember they already know the other team already knows they can see your laser jack down down down grenade out see any problem because the other team's going to push straight away relocating [Applause] don't know where he is probably uh more west more west because that's where the other shot came from did i just see a sniper club moving position i thought i saw a movement down there well they were fighting him right before you guys were right yeah absolutely yeah and that's the three we just killed we just killed the tree there's a special spelling [Music] he could be behind big rock over there yeah i guess we just play zone and wait until he makes a move just keep moving erratically just in case he has an angle yep a higher left from the left from there over here somewhere defense i gotta hear i've got a hill i just i did it like a headshot i thought it was there i just you just hit him yeah yeah i just had only five remaining i was dead [Applause] this game [Music] you're watching it back yeah i mean you might have overflicked but i'm i'm looking right hold on frame by frame by frame by frame expert analysis csi oh that can be more dead on literally and ten percent one could have been on headshot 100 well wasn't there a bug with uh with hit markers and head shots or something um they said they fixed it it was mike tyson though so i'm mike you know he's a pro gamer um never mind uh thank you for tuning into the stream guys i hope you enjoyed that first game there uh just to recap as well uh this is the ffar build that we're using at the moment we don't know if they've hotfixed it yet but that's what we're going with no suppressor at the moment they've changed all the way the attachments work so we're trying to figure out what's good what's not what's good right anyways we're gonna drop a couple of codes in the chat right now we're going to drop a 2 400 cod points code for pc followed by a 2 400 card points code for playstation i'm just going to place those in the chat now and uh first come first serve if you use anything use my create a code if you buy anything a big thanks to activision for supplying those codes and then we've got another eight to give away after that sbr grendel thank you for becoming a member ffa all got hella nerfed yeah it kind of feels like that get yourself [Applause] the posts have different hitboxes there's a solid invisible part maybe that was it sawyer i know i'd like to watch the the clip back afterwards and see if i hit him because i thought i hit him and then start immediately said i thought i hit him as well so maybe there is like a glitch there or something i'll be happy to admit if i missed but i thought that i hit it it is what it is nothing getting nothing lost intron you got the playstation code thank you no problem intron enemy soldier ain't coming [Applause] how's the fire in warzone it's okay victor it's okay i haven't maxed it out yet hope you win this game thank you

franks thank you very much sunday i remember you from yesterday i'm barry thank you for the two the wonder thanks to 25 appreciate you guys it looked like there was invisible wall blocking the geometry maybe i don't know anyway it's done with that it is what it is mike tyson beerus is fine hello hello so you think you hit it then stop yeah i thought i hit mine as well and a couple people said in the chat that that at that position there's invisible geometry yeah yeah so i was saying you know because we literally we literally studied this deck people that people like imagine if you studied this was like yeah [Music] i literally did um but yeah what what it is obviously they haven't built the geometry for the hitbox the same as what they built the models that's technically an area that's out of the map yeah they probably don't even care because no one would expect no one you find in testing i haven't watched i just think it's weird how like you thought you hit it and then i thought i hit it like it's that doesn't usually happen yeah and i was spectating you were watching star tom right yeah yeah i didn't watch my clip back yet but i will [Music] raven please raven please fix this one hitbox is this one game of awesome that doesn't mean anything i thought it might have been a flick but you definitely like stopped and paused before shooting well no there's two frames where i'm on his head correctly the shot and he doesn't move he doesn't actually you know how some people like oh but he moved now he's still in the same place well this is new isn't it uh southwest here guys it's medical here is this name this entire like wall with computer monitors and info on the screens oh look the stocks oh no no no no it's been their ages this uh i don't come in

here yeah he's being rested right now [Music] lovely mate yeah but still yeah for some reason that guy who's prone right there didn't see anything you're killing his teammate who is [Music] yeah well because if you're a good player you can literally spot them through the sun or the flash and just be myself yeah and as long as your movement's good which is just basically hopping and skipping and jumping jump jump yeah jump i thought that in there but um stop my rose skin i down dropped upstairs oh headless men oh you were floating then for a second oh jack you don't have you don't have a head good is when he gets close it's because he's because he got his loadout makes sense right yeah he gets his head back and his loadout it's obvious he'd have a head in the game imagine right if humans didn't have heads but your head was just where your heart is stationed you mean you had eyes in your chest yeah you like your eyes and nose and about in your chest and you just have a hole where your head is hey it me you can have a little window that you open up sorry i don't want to talk to you jasmine just close the doors what does it matter with your head it's just inside my chest it's gone

doing he's nailed it it's just a tom hardy impression it's not like one of his characters yeah it's just how he sounds normally in any role yeah in vain long blue if i if i did crazy of him as alfie solomon's into a cup it would just sound like man the guy just running across the airfield looking mad man it's a glint eastwood store mark the target he's sliding around like a little slippy snake [Music] relocating [Applause] clint eastwood is very good though i like that tongue that's good thanks jack it's patent-pending but yeah can't use that [Applause] it's loud uh should we get selfs or something all right we should get an airstrike for this though illegally [Applause] [Music] i know you're gonna dig this get rid of that [ __ ] there's only a limited number of memes available there is unless you have multiple profiles but he's gonna switch mid game i need to do a go xlr xxx it's just buttons yeah that that's their description for it again the new xlrxl it's just buttons did he

right there oh yeah okay moving here friendly precision airstrike from blue you're gonna kill his mate as well finish one you got a double threat timer yeah he's gotta be behind us right three four three three yeah yeah yes in the warehouse behind wow what we previously thought yeah he's pushing he's pushing pushing jack i can't rest because he's pushing i hit it what are you doing there's another one yeah i know i'm riding someone got behind the wall i think on green i'm gonna pop out here in a second [Applause] he was outside firing at me okay i think i saw movement i don't know got a spare plate stud please yeah yeah thank you i'm out of place oh these are the guys pushing us it's just one it's just one guy left and he's right next to us so he is somewhere yeah he's just at the back of the ball moving here cancel that cancel that does he think he's on green right no i thought he was no i thought i saw a movement but i probably would be in there give me that he was more west i think you think he's just there he steps he's up here with me [Applause] we need to move now whilst they're doing that keep the trees keep the trees let's go martin the champs it was right on blue marker there so we have a little cover now anyway what a stupid clown tag stupid dude they can do whatever they want [Applause] stupid [Applause] a gas mask if you need one um [Applause] remember there is a team on blue and they have snipers and they may be moved should not be wiped out [Music] as long as we can move in he's getting him go don't hit me don't hit me don't hit me down to him watch out for people in the house but we have to keep going [Applause] sad you can get up again in the in the house down that's the guy that's nice [Applause] [Music] are we confident that guy dropped down from green there's no one on that [Music] [Applause] natives [Applause] oh that was close all right three three get ready for it um we kind of deserve no we don't they have this nice one they get the zone unfortunately if we can get some snipes now that'll be decent [Applause] okay i'm a guy again i'm down i forgot your [Music] [Applause] safe zone relocated you know fully played yourself jack he's in the warehouse stop yeah yeah he's got to be probably right corner for mine [Applause] [Music] as well walking around aimlessly for the longest time couldn't win it was some decent games today yeah it's been fun two dubs so far two second places which is sad oh man especially that first second place where you both had tried the guy um i wonder if i should have just got my hdr out then just try one shot oh yeah so the zone would push the gas mask would go on your gas mask would go off your gas mask would go on your gas mask would go you also didn't know how far away it was and then when it ended up being on the back side of the building there snipe could have been good but he tried to pan him through though yeah the crates uh what's the far build uh here it is that's not it there it is jay god recommended that so that's what i've been testing today it's really good no suppressor though so they can see you know they can see you on the mini map when you fire uh that's the hdr as well if you want to copy that right we're gonna drop uh some more codes in the chat oh i just need to copy them sorry bear with me a second okay so we're gonna drop pc playstation and two xbox codes

something no no better stream up maybe a joy dig a giant tag a giant egg a giant egg actually sound like a sample it's just the same every time you say it just a simple man what is this i am a simple man accidentally quit the game button there yeah we won for that one as well we were definitely going to win that game 100 i mean to be fair most of the games we actually win like that uh hot drop at uh the ship yeah yeah is that we haven't had a line that's gone over the ship once today so i'm thinking maybe they've moved it we lose the majority of the players at the start of the game otherwise oh look again it's miles away from the ship generally you think they've done that because everyone's hot dropping it so you lose all the players you have done on purpose yeah we haven't had a line go over here once today all right we're gonna drop more codes in the chat here guys [Applause] pc xbox playstation the codes are coming in hot buy yourself a gun skin buy your brother a gun skin buy your sister a gun skin by your pet labradoodle a new operator whatever it is yeah the ship has zombies out there yeah that's right all right that's enough [ __ ] about now we do this for real now we do

on spawning uh voodoo it's a advanced gas mask you can get it at the ship if you do the zombie thing gives you 30 seconds in the gas apparently they have been in the game already but they were just super rare you could find them in bunkers sometimes they had a very small percentage chance of spawning second loadout if you guys haven't done that already oh yeah [Applause] yeah we've we've shot ourselves in the foot here if we want action yeah we shouldn't have gone to the ship should we it was quite far away though yeah i'm out of the way [Music] um [Music] [Music] tracking your location
