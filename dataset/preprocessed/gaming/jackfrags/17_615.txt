today we're taking a look at the top 50 most upvoted clips on the cod warzone subreddit there are some absolute gems in here and there's a content creator that i watch called museok who did this with fortnite so i thought it would be quite interesting to see what the top 50 looked like on the warzone subreddit i hope you guys enjoyed this if you do leave a like let's take a look right then here we go clip number 50. when your duo's partner and you are scoping downtown and the lights go out there are two snipers here they've been spotted by mr frank dog and his mate here they timed that one perfectly it could not have been any better all right number 49 the smoothest thing i've ever done in a video game put c4 down on the bridge enemy shooting at him from the right times the explosion perfectly on the jeep and gets the finish on the guy shooting him it's impressive right this one's called oops i turned the wrong corner right i understand the title now there's an entire squad there down's one with the car 98 they're pushing him down's the second really nice gets a finish cracked on the third pretty low hp though oh beautiful very well played playing trios the guy in the hobby center right next to him right here next to the door watch this he's right there idiot do you see that i spray painted myself on the door i've never seen that one before it's impressive so we've got a jeep up at the gulag you spot some people on the mini-map there's one down very nice there's two very nice oh there's an attack rover coming surely not is it three in a row it is nice three rockets three hits very good this one's called everyone falls for it i mean he could have easily killed this guy already he's completely unaware [Music] is it another spray on the wall yes it is every time gets them every single time apparently this one is from an average gamer dad who was really impressed with what they've done there's no audio with this one though sweep through the window pulls out the mp7 gets the kill average gamer dad i'm proud of you bro after being chased i ditched my vehicle and put c4 on the helicopter oh you could see that one coming from miles away always check the helicopters for c4 this one's called i will never teabag a knocked player again there's two what it's a review one thing i wasn't happy about that bro there's one other team left he's got a couple of knocks there gas is moving [Applause] hits him with a tea bag i think they're learning lesson there my best play so far 200 iq and the video quality is great there's someone behind him right i think there's two two guys there with riot shields he's put c4 down the right shield team is coming at him he can't get any shots on him put an ammo box down oh i see right okay so put his own ammo box down shot it makes a big explosion kills them this one is a movie style most wanted takedown looks like a solo match most wanted bounty in the truck see from on the front that's right that's a classic classic battlefield tactic right there so i imagine he's gonna try and hunt this guy down can still see the guy right on the edge of the gas there in the truck lines it up perfect textbook c4 quad right there so this is one of this dude's most favorite kills that they've ever got apparently what's going on the roof down's one can't quite get the finish there it does with the follow-up shot remember oh i see hit the collat headshot nice yeah that was pretty pretty tasty i enjoyed that oh it's the ladder of doom these ladders man this guy is taking things really slowly though must be playing on a controller as well because you can't do it on pc enemy uav over here all right we've got one enemy at the top on their own got the dog oh the takedown made his character model fall down the ladder that's unlucky what we got here taking fire pin down on the roof iron sight car 98 that was a little gap there come on hit it hit it nice iron sight versus scope einstein wins this must be one of the earliest gulag kills that i've seen because it's like right after the game came out claymore down he's missed that first one [Applause] surely you're gonna get a second there we go help that random guy out well played [Applause] you've got gas inbound oh no are they glitching in the wall or something yeah come on guys don't don't do this hopefully they fixed that because this post is a few months old so apparently this is a one in a million way to die they're being sniped by someone at the tower i think you've got a loadout drop loadout dropping come in yeah right on top of that perhaps the water tower hang on that wasn't 25 that wasn't his loadout draw that was someone else's random loadout drop that is unlucky right after the gulag this is parachuting back in it's a 4x4 down they there up at a buy station i think i may have seen this one before right he stole the stole the 4x4 and just wants them all over right this clip was called a zero percent chance i don't get reported for hacking this building heartbeat sensor [Applause] a couple of guys in there guess one armor broke on the second nice i mean that's really well played [Laughter] cheeky double kill there impressive oh there's someone else in there there's a third guy no way so this is from someone who is almost 50 years old they said they have a 0.7 kd and this was their first win they're putting down a lot of fire with that growl got the down got the finish it's kind of hard to see how many are left oh there's only one other person left at the moment where are they gas is pushing in bit of pressure spotted him nice gg first ever win congrats all right this one is called gulag round two i think i've seen this one before end game they both go lagged in there's some unspoken agreement here and then they just go at it it's such an awesome clip you just feel the tension in that moment all right this one's from three months ago when the snake shots were in the game and they were really overpowered right he's picked him up there three teams left taking a second to heal teammate goes down in the building we go this is going to be horrible i know it they're reviving actually reloading one of them gets one down jumps back in quick reload again i think they're right on the other side that wall that's another down that's another one [Applause] oh man they were so broken res on the left how many kills was that yeah i'm glad that they got fixed he had too much faith in me so some random player in plunder has put a load of targets on a tree okay he wants him to stand there and shoot the targets he's trying to shoot above the target right i see i see so it's like the apple thing good job just some random guy you've got him to trust him do you have to be the target now i know he just wants him to go further back okay stood on top of the rock this is insane i can't believe they've done this do it oh he doesn't want to do it you know what's gonna happen don't you oh he got it who are these guys i never find players like this oh dear right that's a tricky one did he get it i thought he was gonna get shot in the face then honestly i did so we hit the third one is that it mission complete nope oh i don't know about this one there it is oh that was great that was brilliant maybe rest in peace he's going your left his one yeah you're left with this one some good call outs here your left mid ah that guy yeah that's one that was my right oh dear we've all been there this one's from four months ago it's titled well shizzle gets the load out oh i think i've seen this one before i won't spoil it though yeah lance on top of the light just trying to figure out how to get it shooting it works yeah down on the ground and you're dead they are deadly man they are so deadly this one is called sorry guy i use the cod warzone subreddit too i've got a gulag 1v1 put the spray on the wall he's not falling for it yeah right there that's the spot that was that famous cliff wasn't it fresh out the gulag coolest thing i've done yet you're gonna get through that window aren't you mate yeah and there's a sniper in there take down do it oh oh that one's good i've not seen that one before and gets the second guy too bit of john wick there i think i shot this guy irl what that was literally a three-year-old that was a toddler right so these boys have just come out the gulag and they've got a most wanted contract there's a helicopter chasing them down trying to get him with evr there difficult shots though get into the ditch go to the ditch get low this guy is not giving up oh there you go no the molotov surely not it's gone super slow-mo oh yes he's got him he's actually got him oh my god that throw was brilliant not what i expected to happen but definitely the coolest thing i'll pull off we're in downtown edge of downtown i think there's someone below all right him have seen this one before so he gets that kill goes down for the loot i don't remember what happens here it's something good i remember this one being really good and then there's a 4x4 that comes over [Music] oh yeah he jumps on it he's got the self-rest and he's just pushed along it's so good that this can happen i think i said that the first time just nails the guy that killed him hits the down gets the finish it's a brilliant clip that one this one's quite a new clip it's called why you should use cali sticks in warzone gets one kill gets two gets the third i mean i've unlocked these but i've never used them but they seem pretty powerful and you do feel like a ninja turtle i mean is this guy going to win the game two other teams left i love that they've got the ghillie suit on as well being a proper ninja here has he spotted someone there oh no it's just some tyres the video compression is terrible someone's shooting down here surely not the takedown with the cali6 switched him up with the knife oh the guy's behind him in the gas two people left so he's playing this like a single-player game how have they not seen him man him with the thermite armor break gets the first there it is that was really well played oh this one's called this game is freaking incredible i've seen this one i remember this on the airfield and they use a tetsudo kind of thing where one of them puts a right shield out and the other one covers and they move forward get the down with the corner yeah gets the second one gets the third and then the gas is coming they've got to push and then i think that's it gets all the finishes and as you can hear they're quite elated it's really well played very good all right this is called i dare you to type this in the plane at the start good luck have fun oh i can't i can't show that on youtube not my channel at least basically it's everything that's wrong with the internet this guy got an execution win apparently hit him with a stun ah this guy's done oh that's cool so he made a montage of all his kills in that game was that an execution only he synced up the animation as well nice that's a really awesome clip this one is called the gas visuals are terrible blind everyone or no one right so there's someone up on their roof and because of where that guy was stood no way look at that kill cam there's barely any gas there [Applause] yeah that doesn't seem fair look at that yeah there's a bit of inconsistency there isn't there yeah they've not really addressed that either have they strange this clip is called honestly i give up so i can't imagine that something good is going to happen there just been redeployed from the gulag this is gonna be like the one that we saw earlier they're gonna go through the window straight down the ladder that ladder is the deadliest thing in the game this one is titled psa always descend from the roof just jump off don't use the elevators uh just two people waiting at the bottom and we all know how that went squad pinning down my teammate only ten bullets left so i think they're up on the roof use of the elevator there oh it's the high damage m4 isn't it i think i've got one mag left there's a whole team here take down on the first one finishes the second there's one bullet left hits the stun i think just got it nice genius really thought about that one i thought i'd finally made a friend this pregame lobby just chilling out in the air i seem pretty friendly i don't know what's gonna happen here they're just kind of bumping into each other being shot from the ground what's going on when he landed ruined by a helicopter friendship over me before it even started aimbotting peasants versus right shield hero this guy's got 52 kills obviously cheating oh my god look at this yeah massive cheat he's gonna lose i don't think it's 52 kills man how is this guy not been bad c4 oh the right shield's coming towards him he can't shoot dude oh he's going with the knife did he just do that that was actually sick kind of getting towards endgame here running the ground is the last memory squad oh is that three riot shields [Laughter] i mean that's impressive you wouldn't even be mad if that happened you gotta give it to him okay number nine oh i've seen this one before yeah this was in one of my uh crazy things you can do in cod video three helicopters i don't know what they're doing i don't think they're even on the same team but this guy nails them with one rocket so many kills so many vehicles destroyed just like that it is insane that's an insane clip right number eight is called that felt good we're outside stadium there's a whole team camping up there in quads hits the first with the hdr here's the second that guy didn't even move it's the third fourth guy's rezzing come on yeah that's clean that is so clean right number seven got a guy at the playing a bit of plunder hdr again all right there's someone in the air traffic control center he's got the variable zoom spot someone that's a lot of dip on that shot surely not so 2500 meters that was hold on look at the dip oh my god headshot as well brilliant all right number six max rank hacker versus one wyatt shield guy who is gonna win this dude's got 31 kills please i was just shooting everyone through walls about horrible the right she'll go up here he's right there you just can't damage him can you get him when he reloads i think he's right in the corner it's kind of hard to see there is sounds gone he's got him he just nailed him he's bashing with the right shield i mean it is satisfying to see that isn't it right number five is called this is what fear looks the like guy on the roof no he doesn't want to die he does not want to die what kind of dpi is that guy got his mouse though look at this that's some rapid head movement right there boys quick right number four my duo partner is my six-year-old son i'm not that kind of man that just hides around and not like you really is this guy actually six years old [Music] this kid is six years old and i found the problem he's making call outs and everything he's pinging they're fighting each other some grenade i got heartbeat is this kid really sinks he's pushing him so i think the perspective is the dad and that guy there is the kid thank you he's making gulag call-outs as well this kid's insane all right let's go right so this is the kid now we're just beckoning him he uses a stone gets the tag [Applause] this [Music] i'm sure we'll see him in some esports competitions or something when he's older all right top three it's a down with an mp5 there's a truck coming oh i see the dumpster actually stopped the truck and he's jumped in the truck hang on let's just watch that again so there's a tiny little gap there look yeah the truck can't get in there [Music] nice thinking as well to get back in the truck get the squish good job okay number two i remember this one this is the blueprint for the ebr that was broken okay so now here so that's a normal ebr and then they're gonna switch to this one which i think was called the the line breaker it was a blueprint me put on the armor and it was bugged at bug damage one armor so his teammate puts three armors back in armor obviously in this case it's not his teammate it's an enemy that's joined the same game but it's someone he's on comes with and it's a one-shot kill it was bugged but they did fix it pretty quick to be honest i think it was fixed within a week and that brings us to the top voted clip of all time at the moment on the cod warzone subreddit i know what this one is it's titled excuse me what the frick but i mean i've seen it before but it it gets me every time here's a truck it's a one-on-one battle right now the truck's having a great time trying to run this dude over throws the gas at him backs up i don't know why this happened and the guy's laugh just makes it man truck what are you doing so good it almost like flies through the air towards him as well as if it's got a mind of its own it's brilliant it should never have happened and yet it did that's why i love it without said that is it for today guys do let me know down in the comments below what your favorite clip was out of the top
