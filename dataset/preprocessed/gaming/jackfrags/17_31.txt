i think that i found my new favorite thing and i had no idea that this was in the game sniper elite five it's only just released but there's a new game mode in it called invasion and i bet you can take a good guess at the what this is you click play you start the matchmaking and then you're thrown into a random person single player level as a sniper jaeger a sniper hunter your objective is to kill the other real player sniper before they can complete all of their objectives and their mission or they kill you instead i love this concept and it's very satisfying i've played for about an hour already and i can't get enough it's ingenious so simple and i hope you guys enjoy this leave a like and let me know what you think down in the comments below so here we go then i haven't played any of this yet campaign on multiplayer but i'm going to do some evasions because it looks fun i can customize my loadout here i've only got the rsc for primary mp40 i can actually customize the gun what i didn't expect that items couple of grenades bandage medkit lovely i've got skills here as well what does this do i have no idea i'm just gonna jump into a game and see if i can go kill some people the war factory invading an enemy what the hell was that i don't even know the controls i have to be honest with you there's dead people here does that mean the players around here i can hear the gunshots i have a map as well look there's me i suppose they could just be anywhere on this level then is that how this works where are they oh is that them there dying on the ground [Music] okay uh did the game go easy on me then i think they'd been down there were self-resting or something right first one in the bag not a very clean shot though just went right through the elbow didn't it put a different sight on it maybe very fast aim speed what's my current one 6x we'll keep that for now jump into another game the atlantic wall oh this looks pretty d-day vibes uh what the i spawn in and there's literally an aa cannon or something on fire in front of me but this guy has been at work already behind me though in front of me i've got no idea do i just follow the fire oh got a dead guy dead german soldier is that them i mean there's definitely something going on there is that a player maybe that's the player can i get through this little gap in the fence prone i feel stealthy am i stealthy i don't know they were running around here weren't they it's a dangerous game of cat and mouse hold that [Applause] is that it one bullet surely it's not one bullet maybe they were just on low hp or something another one okay same up again is it going to be in a different location it looks kind of the same oh gunshot already over there lads watch out there's an enemy player about this is like the same spot isn't it oh did the npcs just kill him so you have to opt into this because obviously if you're playing single player and you don't want to be invaded you can just opt out so it doesn't happen but i think it's on by default so you have to turn it off oh look at this oh this is where i started isn't it dead body it must spawn you near them right or maybe not i don't know the map is massive the trailer bodies here the players definitely being this way at some point recently though i don't know what these phones are either can i interact with that oh more dead soldiers oh no what is this activate booby trap so the player must be able to use the phone for some reason an ally player can get your location by using the phone i see so that's what it's for there is a yellow thing here on the mini mouth i don't know if that's an objective or some kind of activity honestly don't know you're friendly aren't you left out to stay sharp makes them more perceptive now you may be wondering what's in it for the person playing single player to leave this on and i asked in tommy's chat earlier and he said that they just get xp so i think it's like a bonus xp if you manage to kill someone that's invading you you actually get more xp ow what the hell was that hold q select a med kit is that mine or something i'm gonna heal myself i think i just ran over a mine well they're gonna know where i am now okay so i think because it's been a certain amount of time i can use this and get their location oh they're over there 130 meters and they've revealed my location as well it's not like a real time mini map ping or something like that it just looks like it's a rough approximation of where they are [Music] oh this is tense they've ran away i'm gonna push oh maybe i startled them okay good another one this is addictive oh mate stay on guard right stay focused i saw a cheeky american snipe around here at some point lads remember stay on point and here's me just running across the open so it's nothing so i think they do actually get a warning when i join their game as well so they'll know that i'm here hunting for them oh they'll know nothing gonna fire now it's raised go on a day three two you went early why did you go early okay so i wonder if they've just started this level because there's actually a lot of alive germans right now i suppose if i tag those and the enemy player kills them i'll know about it honestly i think this player has just started this campaign level i haven't seen any dead bodies yet how god is that that's a friendly isn't it oh something happened something's happening what oh so they just completed an objective where is that i don't know the map that looked like an a gun that blown up maybe here there it's interesting that it shows me that i guess that's a way to kind of figure out roughly where they might be okay i think i can actually use this phone now to find out where they are just call up high command lads you see any snipers around here get the uav up boom over there 200 meters right you're dead if i could just if i think the ai have actually figured out where they are is that them there maybe i want to get a clean kill on this one where'd they go they were right here i think that's the right there isn't it i just no scoped him i actually just no scoped it i didn't think i'd get away with that to be honest oh this is so much fun i just can't believe that more games haven't done this yet what's going on another one lots of different skins here as well look the humble sailor [Music] that guy looks pretty badass i'll go with that guy headgear helmet that'll help me blend in a bit same level again that's been blown up over there lads what did you see yep totally understood that because i've not played these levels before i don't know where you would go after you've done this because this is obviously one of the things isn't it come and destroy this a battery maybe you can mess with that truck and make it explode and distract the ai so where would you go after this i'm gonna go post up in this tower for a bit do some overwatch and just wait patiently oh he sniped someone up there look there's a sniper rifle there too so where are they my location was revealed so they must have used the phone then right i'll booby trap that i'm sure i can hear someone shuffling around but it might be the ai it might be one of these weird generators that's going off oh no that's ninja your takedown gave it away i heard the knife go in what are you playing at i think i'm actually addicted to this it's just ruining someone's day simulator isn't it that's all this is chateau de beringer occupied residence mission 2 don't think i've played this one yet looks like hogwarts or pogwarts if you want to call it that i wonder if whatever difficulty that the host is playing the game on affects my stats as well like my health and stuff all right lads there's something going down here hi hello they're looking over here why are they looking over here and i suppose i could use the ai as bait couldn't i all have wall hacks [Music] what the automatic piano oh my god there's a lot of friendlies here running around i've been revealed not like this wait could they be in a disguise can they disguise themselves no i hope not it's like hit man can i use that i could actually use that machine gun if i wanted to just see if i can attract some attention i'm over here come and get me it's a snipe off it's full enemy at the gates this really isn't it [Music] oh what is that are they just baiting me what are those ai firing at maybe the guy's in there i'm gonna go use the phone over there 145 meters okay they've got my location as well you could use this as bait couldn't you you totally just bait someone like as soon as you know that they found you you could move and then look at that position where you just were and snipe them which hopefully isn't what they're doing to me right now this second maybe they were spotted here and they went down look there's a body there okay this is it isn't it this is the trail of destruction they're gonna be in here i think or they're left or right i feel like left's a better bet no there's a soldier here though maybe they went right oh god in there whoa oh oh my god that gave me a jump scare actually scared the crap out of me oh my god what what is this is so much fun okay same map again but we spawned in a different location here we've got overwatch already should we stick to the high walls here oh i thought that was them they all look so similar no they're all friendlies this does have a 5v5 mode as well but like i said i've not played it yet not played any of it yet really i just saw tommy playing this and thought actually looks really good gunshots over there oh man i'd love to get a long range sniper wait that that come from in here oh there they are so they're shooting at they just shot that soldier's helmet off come on kill him now this guy isn't going to expect me to be here i think [Music] and then moving in look oh god so wait for them to come into the open is that friendly's pushing him i think there's an ai there pushing him look he's shooting at him puffer blood there have they been hit [Music] here we go bit low got a lead a bit got him oh i missed the first three this is gonna be a headshot oh oh my goodness the long range kill that is brutal bitching trigger i'll be there baby all right we'll do one more secret weapons okay i've not played this map yet we're at night time there's a wagon rolling in got some tanks here there's actually a machine gunner on top of that tank truck here hmm i feel like this level's just started again i marked these friendlies here in the little motorbike sidecar look at that it's adorable gunshot right over there what's over there um might have been in that building let's have a look quite a nice looking game as well i don't see them very moody an atmospheric this i like this i think they're just taking people out over here friendly okay they were shooting down here oh wait are you just doing target practice you are aren't you i just got baited hard by that didn't i it's just a bit of target practice oh this music man something's happened up there lads good patrolling keep it up infantry here are shouting why are they shouting oh man there's lots of long lines of sight here okay that didn't sound like target practice that sounds like fully automatic fire over there and there's a road leading up there by the looks of it let's get some elevation could be somewhere here he's right there can i do a takedown yes crept up behind him he didn't have a clue no idea whatsoever god you would absolutely crap your pants did that happen to you i think but there it is sniper elite five that right there that's the money i like that right guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye
