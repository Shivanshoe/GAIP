take a very close look at the footage on your screen right now would you believe me if i told you that this was a video game released in november of 2015. that's coming up on almost seven years ago and it looks better than other games that are releasing even today now i know that the title gave it away but without that you might not have even realized what you're looking at here this is star wars battlefront created by dice at this point the stormtroopers would be a dead giveaway of course but i want to focus on the graphics and detail here as in my opinion in that respect this game was well ahead of its time and it's a testament to the work and passion applied here by the developers obviously a lot of time care and attention went into this and years later that effort still shines through i mean just look at this walking through endor here the streams of water on the ground the waterfalls and rocks the dense foliage all over the ground it just sells it all as a living breathing environment to get lost in in the daytime endor comes to life the reflections in the water change the light rays beam through cracks in the tree canopy illuminating the battles raging below and there's a ton of wildlife here to find too from strange hummingbird type creatures to butterflies and even adorable ewoks and larger beasts up in the trees and looking into the sky we can see death star 2 star destroyers all sorts of ambient details filling in the space and when it rains the mood changes again here in a storm and you'll notice that it's not only the visuals making this special but the audio design in this game too was phenomenal turn your volume up and soak this in for a few seconds now whilst we don't know exactly how long dice worked on this game before it released in november 2015 we do know when it was first announced and that was at an e3 press conference on june 10 2013 and there the studio unveiled a teaser trailer for this title built on the frostbite 3 engine so it's at least two plus years but judging by the level of polish here i would assume that it's closer to three in total and thanks to a couple of behind the scenes clips we came to know how some of this level of detail was achieved dice was apparently given unprecedented access to the lucas cultural arts museum and archives to capture highly detailed photos and scans of the actual models and props used in the original trilogy of movies they were photographed extensively and some of them 3d scanned they also visited the original locations where the movies were shot to capture the environments and the emotions of them and they leaned heavily into a technique called photogrammetry where extremely high resolution photographs are taken of objects from multiple angles this could be rocks vegetation terrain trees anything really and then those photos are mapped onto 3d meshes after that they're imported into the game engine and they can be placed as assets on a level according to a gdc talk from 2016 dice took over 100 000 photos in total for their photo scanning work in this game now whilst i am playing this in 2022 on a modern pc at maxed out autographics and a native 4k resolution you could have had the game looking this good when it released they didn't add any extra graphics options down the line or anything and i'm not running any mods here either the performance is great too it's a very well optimized game considering how good it looks in fact the game ran at an almost consistent 60 frames per second on the consoles it released on at the time the playstation 4 and xbox one albeit at a lower resolution with some of the bells and whistles that you can see on this footage disabled the details had an impact on the gameplay too this is the battle of jakku one of the only references the game makes to the new sequel trilogy in the sky battles rage overhead the skybox is full of capital ships x-wings and tie fighters blasting each other laser fire fills the air making an easy distraction from what's happening at the battle on the ground the game does a brilliant job of depicting the battle of hoth too and we can experience things here that we didn't see or hear about in the empire strikes back movie it's a cold and harsh environment and the front lines of the trenches must have been hell to fight from on either side you leave footprints in the snow as well so do the other soldiers now by today's standards this is pretty normal but in 2015 that was a cool detail and what of the 8080 the sinister walker slowly clunking its way toward the rebel base the giant feet at the bottom of its legs leave craters in the snow that you can actually dive in and use as cover should you be so lucky and of course you could be crushed by them too if you were in the wrong place at the right time for a bit of trivia dice also created the look and feel of the planet solus for the star wars universe in this game as you can see here it was mentioned only once in return of the jedi but with no context of its appearance and they opted for a black lava planet with a large buildup of imperial forces and military installations wrapping things up the gameplay itself was very arcadey for some people it was a fun star wars experience that they could hop in and out of but others were looking for more depth teamwork and progression akin to the original battlefront titles however there's no denying that even by today's standards this is an incredible looking game that's why i think the technology used here was ahead of its time and it's obvious that a ton of love detail and resources was thrown into this project before it released now i'm going to leave you with something that i recorded this morning it's part of the game that many people didn't know existed in a tutorial section and i think it ties together everything that we've talked about today only with a bit of scripting and narrative thrown in to make a cool single player experience a window into what could have been or what will be perhaps i did it first time too i promise that's a lie but if you showed me this next week and said it was for a new game that they showed off at e3 or gamescom i think that i'd believe you and many others would too thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like and a comment below sit back and enjoy some lovely speeder bike action on
