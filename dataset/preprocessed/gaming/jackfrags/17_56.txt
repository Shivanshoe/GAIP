so i just played a match where i came third i got my butt kicked and i hated it very few kills on the board right towards the end game shot in the back rowand hopefully this game goes a bit better i'm starting to learn them up a bit more now as well especially like this area they're going to be above me here jumping jack rabbit there just came flying through the door i'm gonna switch here see if i can get this guy [Applause] one more ah imagine just imagining anybody hit that just as the head was dropping down there this guy above me this is phoenix three strike him bound not coming down [Applause] hmm no enemy hits on that run well they went in there instead still there now just in case enemy uav active [Applause] drop out excuse me watch the skies just beating himself off the roof there interesting when they come back weird there already got one get to the new safe zone gas is closing in the building oh unless that's a bait enemy uav active what do you reckon they dropped out that was bad got there as well they just disconnected or are they still there [Applause] i didn't expect to just push me there though that's another one no that's the same guy again the old resurgence timer okay right you're out of the game won't be seeing you again enemy cluster strike what's this right somewhere down here you're being tracked carefully where'd you go [Applause] i don't know why but it looks a bit on the roof they behind it spend some money there now they're in the building now what is going on right underneath me apparently that sounds something like from the godzilla movie oh there's a guy down here [Applause] some kind of device that you used to control godzilla i know your game mate they got a respawn as well this is why i like massages i wanted to do a video with the owen gun i remember two or three warzone videos ago [Applause] i posted a game where i came second i think it was the first time that i played with that snoop dogg skin and the guy just shot me in the back and i watched it back and i died so quickly against [Applause] oh my god he blended in so well there almost got me turned up that battle pass skin isn't it everyone's got it and it's like so dark it's easy to miss it hostile dropping into the area watch the skies that's a different guy run across now on the roof of course i'm literally like what seven minutes into the game or something i think the whole time i've just been here i moved away a bit yeah but i want to do a uh proper owen gun video i'm not really using that much i mean this is someone else's but yeah the damage of it is just like it's crazy i feel like it is just the best smg right now i'm gonna wait for this guy okay i actually nearly messed that up i've got time for loadout maybe without a gas mask though are you kidding me i took in a mess why did you not finish me off how did i just get away with it it's the end game resurgence has been turned off dude absolutely and then just closing in didn't go that is ropey you can tell though the damage on this really really good on the owen gun [Applause] that's probably the gun the roof in it got me i'm gonna check on the right here i would all that pds could come in handy although i should put plates down first two over there yes he's moving no one on the right enemy uav not really a bad pull because i've got this uh cover above me here i think those footsteps we're just on the roof again um oh wait i feel like i should wait like not having a gas mask here sucks oh this is really good cover i can just tuck it under the stairs here five left this is in that guy can stay on the roof just moving in new safe zone highlighted let's come back to me okay five remain finish this once and for all my gap there could be a bit risky i know someone just fired down there [Applause] i might just wait in this door and just hold that angle that person's gonna be coming up there was that inside or was that on the roof again [Applause] two left i know that one is still on the roof there's one could try for a kill maybe oh they put pds up look at the mini map oh my god they got the mask give me a second maybe [Music] [Applause] is my god that was so stressful 11 kills my heart is pounding man those are the wins though that feel the best you know i hate it but at the same time i love it like that's so much fun i've got to get me a decent owen gun build though man whatever that guy had on that that was nuts the damage has it always been that good or what anyway guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed that if you did leave a like subscribe if you're new as always thanks to everyone using my creative coding cod store your legends jack frags and caps right i'm off see you next time bye
