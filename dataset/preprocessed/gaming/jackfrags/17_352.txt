hey guys and welcome to some bf5 live gameplay commentary a couple minutes ago the official battlefield twitter account tweeted this here are some words that rhyme with soon june and boom pretty much confirming that vf6 will be revealed in june and we can take some of the previous information that we know from investors calls and from the blog that they released that it's much more likely to be revealed in the first or second week of june because previously they said spring and i looked on google this is something that i've never searched before but apparently the end date for spring in the us and the uk is typically the 19th or the 20th of june and the rumored ea play date obviously they're not doing ea play at los angeles this year it's just gonna be a online event like it was last year the rumor date for that is the 14th of june now does that mean the game will be revealed at ea play i would guess probably not because with this being battlefield and would there be so much hype around this new game i imagine that they probably want it to have its own time in the sun and its own little event man these headshots are popping pretty good start so far so i reckon there'll be some kind of online event or they'll just drop a teaser in the first week of june and then ea play we'll get something else some more stuff i don't know that would be my best guess and that is really exciting not long to go now at all steve what's he doing back there i'll miss that one damn it i mean the hype train is already in full swing at the moment definitely on social media loads of people want to see this game learn about it what it is and you know we just haven't got that long to wait ugh i'm dead ruined leon phil got me though can i get a rest there's a guy oh sir jane nelson's coming for me so it's a very exciting time if you're a battlefield fan even if you're not and you're just into fps games or gaming in general huge just so much hype for this game and i'm going to be covering the reveal probably live i'll do a live stream of it see how that goes and there's a tank there isn't there well i'm dead there's no way i can get across here what do you guys thoughts let me know down in the comments below are you excited how do you think this is going to turn out i'm hyped man i'm really hyped we've got that plane's coming for us [Music] oh no right i think this is the end this has got to be the end for me oh i have to hit the headshot peek again i'm sorry that wasn't a headshot all i could see was the guy's head oh my god i'm right here oh no i missed it missed it again i'm out of sync with this wookie i'm gonna go pro i swear there's still someone over there oh god i can hear them all around me got him two more over here oh they flanked me from behind fair play i mean i think i definitely outstayed my welcome there didn't i old willy milner there how do we do 13 not bad not bad at all this is iwo jima breakthrough honestly in bf5 i think this is the best map game mode combination it just offers so many good things this map in game mode no going around that tank i've got the car 98 here by the way definitely my favorite sniper oh god big bomb are the graphics going to be like in bf6 as well this game came out in what 2018 and we've had next-gen consoles since then they've said the game is being developed you know to take advantage of the next-gen consoles it could just look insane you just look absolutely insane it's only on next-gen and pc a frostbite engine they've had a few years to develop it put new technologies in it that's what five is it five dev studios working on the new game they've said could be insane [Applause] oh no so john nelson's dead again ruined will it be on previous gen consoles they've never exclusively said in their investors calls or in that blog hey the game is just for but they've next-gen said that it's being developed to take advantage of next gen i think that's the language they used what is hitting me there but you know maybe that player base that still exists on xbox and ps4 xbox one and ps4 is too big to ignore the consoles have been so difficult to get hold off the other guy that i want that's that wookie from before isn't it that i was out saying let me get around here i thought for sure he would have been here already there's someone looking at me there isn't that wookie again ow [Music] damn it there's a tank on the point huh they're up in the air so many people right there i've got knives i thought i had grenades well i'm gonna fall back from that i think we lost that point hello sorry nice yeah i'm dead oh cheeky headshot is he still there yeah there's someone there you see the guy's mohawk and i just sheared it off with that sniper shot fancy a haircut mate he
