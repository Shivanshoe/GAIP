drinking a beer in the background what is going on we're on the planet already oh yeah it's yeah all right oh god why do they attack you i don't get it well we can park further away and use the apc if you want this is cool man all right we'll go over here there's a bit of creaking there that's fine there's a bit of a problem yeah well no then we are straight oh god why is that not what's going on what i think there's a hilltop oh okay there's a hill behind us our ass is up in the air okay all fine no no no crashing i'm getting in the seat hey guys we might need a tractor beam i'm coming yeah i'm coming with it that looks so stupid what's your view right this is a giant ship let's use the tank i'll put this back in here then we can use the tank watch out i say we use both pretty let's use both all right let's use both do you want to drive one how do i turn it all on well you press u first yeah does it go okay wait are the ramps up oh yeah here we go baby are we going to the bunker what are we doing right now dude yeah you bring that well right where so where is this bunker now i i have no idea get in tom oh i see it i see it i'm leading the way we can be like a patrol convoy oh tom what is that i've got a turret can i fire the main cannon i'm sorry yeah how do i do that well hang on i'm in front of you guys and it's pointing at me no i didn't i think you're just aiming it right now you are aiming it yeah but how do i shoot i know you're aiming at me stop it that's not the main character tom's just giving you a tickle that's fine just find the main cannon over there there you go fine who's firing it did that hit i think that here it's pretty cool if you press p the turret will like fold up because it's in there it turns off the um oh wicked it's like storage mode you know turns off the the weapon [Music] we're being shot by the turret destroy the turret there it is i've got nothing hold on we're getting a good position here tom i think we're gonna get crime stuff for this bang up a bit ready yeah engage bang oh it's it's obliterated did we get it are there hostiles inside this yeah but no jesus below we can't get them from here now do we need to park around the back for this tour it's fine i can hear guns yeah all the hostels are going to be dead by the time again this is all right now we can bring the box what's in the box is that so we can put stuff in it yeah i see so this is the bunker mission yeah are these new no no no no they're just now they have sometimes have loots okay there we go do not shoot any men in white armor but they're like security okay no white armor whatsoever if you shoot them it's over really there might be different color on this planet don't shoot the guys in white armor get the ones with in the green turquoise color oh there's yellow armor on this planet yeah it's yellow you can see him don't shoot the yellow guys don't yeah don't shoot yellow is that guy dead what there's a blue guy here jack blue actually the yellow guy oh yeah yeah yeah that one kill him okay blue guy dead nice guys this guy's a friendly i think yeah is he yeah yeah aim at you i'll be honest nice there's one down there isn't that what was that small blue guy is that guy stuck in the geometry muffled no one authorized personnel we can't go through that i dropped two more need one more remaining here get it okay blue guy dead objective complete we've got them all we killed him look at him he's dying tom see if there's loot boxes around don't observe the new game play luke all right i'm right next to you down there oh cool what is it yeah there's the box oh oh oh what's in it what do we get sniper rifle there's a gun there's guns in it oh baby that sniper rifle you can't buy in the shops anymore jack so it's literally only loot one of those rare helmets i got people are selling in-game for like 400 000 credits 400k so it's actually a good money maker to get rare loots let's just check if there's any other cool looking boxes around i don't know i don't even know what half them look like mission success well yeah we've got lots of loots i'm trying to see if there's those red boxes there's also like white box oh this this guy's helmet's good look see this guy's helmet oh that's the one that you've got yeah we can take that look love that put that in our little box nice so you basically took all the loot that was down here and put it in that giant box yeah and we're gonna put that back in the apc yeah i've just got another a few helmets i'm bringing watch out for the deadly box will that kill us yeah yeah we can now kill you no problem it's stuck on the man there you go that tank is so loud whatever that is well we almost dropped it down the [ __ ] elevator shaft then [Music] oh that would have been terrible jack i'll call the elevator you imagine if i just jumped it down the shaft then and all that for really just lost everything no there is actually nothing down there yeah jesus christ went straight over there i'm not oh my god he was all right look at this nice light in here that ain't gonna fit oh god did we come in that way oh nice [Music] yes got the loot box can i get him with you tom what are you firing up testing the range of it it's quite cool isn't it how it looks that's awesome i love it all right you're shooting at my ship uh obviously there are ships but do you think they'll ever do like hovering vehicles like attack helicopters and stuff um what do you mean well there are sort of inner atmosphere fires that can do that yeah that's what i mean like something that can't go into space but it's just in atmosphere like uh apache or something this is fine [ __ ] god what is going on you just blew me out are you in were you in front of me did you just hit something um what oh no now we need the box you killed will uh uh oh at least the ball is still there i i i just thought you i thought it was i thought the turret was going to fire over him but it turns out it's just no that's what i mean it's that's a minimal loss that is that's fine where's the apc gone wait i think i vaporized it oh oh no i don't know if this will fit i'm fitting is that that good you could have to ride the tank as well jack because there's no room for you to get in hang on i've got an idea i got an idea put that down there okay drive it's fine it's fine let's drag it along mine i think it's don't cut i'll scroll in now scrolling yeah i am i have to keep doing it as we drive i really rapidly do it oh sh what the levitating boats can't believe this worked tom [Music] all right we made it i get the time back in time [Music] okay the box is in wait what if what if we open the ramp when we're in space and i use the tank can we shoot a ship down while we're in space with the tank is that possible are we going towards this guy's last home position jack is that turning the turret i don't think that's turning the turret though in the driver's seat yeah it's on you just fire left click oh yeah that works open the room i mean the lamps aren't even open on my screen they're malfunctioning or something okay so when you fired yeah earlier did it just it's internally i guess it yeah must have been are they open oh god that one's opening yet one's open it's only done one it might be broken no i think it's been i think you've shot it with the tank jack and it's broken it yeah i think maybe i did you have to just shoot out that side then okay well i've got a very small window there you know possible put the back of the ship up yeah that's it that's it a bit more yeah i can't really see it yet stop it's it's pretty close okay down a little bit up a little bit oh god oh god is that it that miss is it him let me get right close to jack okay you see him right right right right stop yes [Music] [Music] security we just killed what'd you read yeah it was the wrong one get it right tom right right so close up a little bit [Music] ow up a little bit stop stop what's that hitting it's so close god it's really difficult i'm gonna end up falling out of this you're going to be fine what would even happen if you went outside it's placed around do you want me to see is it are you in space i mean is it close he's right there in front of us i think it's smoking in here firing out the back might be easier because it's a wider angle that's the wrong way [Music] face [Music] i don't know i lost control death again help me i'm just drifting away help what happens if you shoot does it make you like thrust forwards well like the team yeah i'm gone am i gonna end up falling down onto this planet i'm gonna have to scoop you back up hang on don't worry where did that happen you are quite high up i think tom if you could pull this off honestly if you pull this off i love how i can still control the tank god it's so difficult wait can i stop my spin no this is like interstellar [Music] in space in a tank all right all right well that ship is awesome though man it looks wicked yes there's a good thing you're just staying there now and just turn around gently that's it that's it that's the one that's nearly backwards backwards yes yes oh really you nearly swallowed me in there oh oh hang on is your ship on fire a little bit where's it gone you've flown away quite a lot you're heading towards an asteroid am i yeah where is it i can't see oh you're in a vorpal spin now disable couples make it decoupled it'll be easier for you you're trying to catch me on the top oh you bounced me away oh no ping pong okay you need to be more careful okay this is good this is a good angle i just gotta get ahead of you yeah then line it up okay i'm not gonna move i'm not moving at all that's it that's it that's it then down down yeah come on come on back a bit back a bit back a bit okay yeah oh my god he's actually done it he's actually done it that is unbelievable what a pilot what a legend tommy rage the tank catcher i can't believe it let's close the exterior close the exterior christ okay all right let's get out was this that was extremely interesting i'm closing that ramp i thought i was gone for good there have you explored the top of this ship no have a look look at this look at the damage on all red oh i thought that was just because it looked cool no the engine seems to be spewing particles i'm not sure yeah it could have been because of the tank shot oh no is that because we walk drive yeah this is where we sleep it did take quite a beating i'm surprised it's oh no it's a little cuddly apc toy down there that's cool looks like the uh the mako it took an internal tank shot as well didn't it yeah it did yeah what's the recognition about this is just like fun and games in here i don't know a recreation room i don't see a monopoly anywhere well this is like a coffee machine okay we're rhyming oh this is a fast quantum drive yeah bridge there nice this compartment is filling with smokes completing this fire back here i mean in the tank i did see the smoke and i didn't mention it but i thought it would just go away uh this fire is causing it nice volumetric smoker i'm um i hope the cruise control is not on full speed otherwise we're gonna crash into the planet and die let's go check sounds like it might be what's this what it's actually got different different lighting modes on it there we go where's the box by the way did we lose oh we didn't lose the but there it is the box with all the loot is safe somehow it made it right here we can sell all the stuff now sadly i can only sell it one by one so it's gonna take me a little while just to get it and then how much money are we gonna make i'm on 731. let's see i'll sell it and i'll give us an equal an equal cut what will what are we doing thirds or half how much money do
