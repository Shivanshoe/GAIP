I'm in my mom's car broom broom I look at this guy whoa I'm gonna give him the hot joke ring here we go he's actually coming over it ah mate you got about three seconds it's so good it's so good I have to take the Joker in solo mode because stuff like this happens the only decent loot not really see that on the map guys there's another one over here look at this is he coming here he is he's coming over frag out come on you just driving straight to walls but I gotta get out of here are you dead oh man that is just that is just too funny too good hi everyone hope you're doing well if you watched my live stream or video yesterday you'll have seen me attempting this tactic in solos now solo mode in Cod war zone I think it can be a really county experience just everyone hiding in buildings all the time not much movement but the way I like to play solos is this I find myself a vehicle and I go hunting that's what I do now as I was driving up in that TAC Rover this rude manner here shot at me so I had to get revenge the great thing about this tactic in solos is that the cars in general tend to have a lot of health and it can be quite difficult to shoot the driver in the face so if you're careful you actually have a lot of time to drive up to people and survive without taking any damage while you can just slap them against the wall it's great rest in peace ghost now before we get into the highlights of an absolutely mad truck game that I recorded earlier I wanted to show you some of the crazy clips from yesterday this is the kind of stuff you can get away with by doing this as a guy here donkasaurus [Music] [Music] yes a lot and what can you do come on bro she's army where are you know years somewhere Arius literally right here as that self res going for you so as you can see the solos at least it is a valid tactic I don't think it works that well in squads because you've got three people potentially shooting at you which means more chance of dying and also your vehicle will just die a lot quicker but in solos yes this can actually work out quite well and that brings me to this game with you're about to watch and I set out attempting to try and get as many kills with vehicles with the truck in particular as possible so I've dropped its storage and all I found is an RPG but the mark played this I realized RPG is actually really good you can want bang people with this thing but I took that guy down quite easily picked up the mp7 which by the way I think for solos is absolutely monster of a weapon especially when you're playing this type of playstyle where you're driving up to people jumping out and you're really close range because that's where the mp7 excels yes you will probably lose mid range to an assault rifles but if you get up close and close that gap mp7 can be really good so can the mp5 just may be worth considering so you saw me pick up my third kill there with the RPG yes it was a one bank I meant what I said you could maybe use the RPG as a secondary weapon to just instantly delete people but at this point in the game I found myself a truck and I like to go hunting I like to go for the bounties get as much cash as possible but I spotted someone in the corner here I'm sorry mate there's no escape side crush I love that we're gonna watch that back in slow motion check this out so I missed the initial head-on assault doesn't matter smush that one that one will sting I love how he's trying to just scurry away our truck kill number 2 is a game of cat and mouse I would say so I've located counter truck here it's an enemy they know how to play solos but they jump out and this shows how useful the Joker is because I fired a shot I don't think you even get a warning you know if you're in a ground vehicle you'll be when you're in the chopper but as you can see he's been forced to jump out because otherwise he would have died I go for him these fences aren't destructible unfortunately trying to reverse into him no still don't work but I'm actually covered like he can't hit me if you reverse into them they can't hit you like they can't shoot through that truck the only way that he could have killed me then was if he repositioned or if you actually blew the truck up so you can use reversing to cover your actual character model though it's a bit further on in the game here I'm still roughly in the same area looking for dots on the mini-map people shooting and as you can see even though I've been in two engagements I've still got about 50% HP of trust with this guy in the train car nice little Dodge there but this is another way you can do it so if you jump out they just focus their attention on the truck itself they don't realize that you've jumped out so while they're shooting at the truck you're just hosing them down with the mp7 without taking any damage I think he had been a engagement so I drove over maybe I was looking for a new vehicle a new truck or something but I spotted a guy in here and this is why I love stun grenades to stuns going you get the hit marker barely took any damage in that engagement at all I think that's the most important thing in Cod warzone though if you're taking one on ones in solos your aim as a solo player is to take as little damage as possible and you should do whatever you can in that particular single engagement to try and ensure that so this is a really important part of this tactic if you want to get kills by tracking people over you've got to get UAVs they're only $4,000 you can make that quite easily by yourself whether that's from a scavenger or an engagement or just a few crates UAVs are the one and they will help you locate targets this is a really funny fight though what's this so I knew that he was going to camp behind the ball so I got out the truck do down the proximally mine he takes me out I start to self rest he triggers the mine which detonates and kills him but it also blows up the truck and that kills me and cancels the self revive so I'm sent to the Gulag just one of those moments where I didn't really think about what would happen because the explosive radius on those mines are actually really really big and I think they can one bank any vehicle in the game that's a pretty straightforward do like their origin 12 get the kill nice and quick my strategy in gulag is usually just rush the middle get control of that as quick as possible so we land back down I get myself an mp7 I still fight with this dude he had a p90 I think but mp7 was actually better there now I find another truck of course I'll go straight for the truck it's on the map I'm gonna get it now I like to call this kill the blue whale because it reminds me of a blue whale jumping momentarily out of the sea to catch some prey so majestic it's getting pretty late into the game now 22 players left I've got 10 kills and of course this is a small area and somewhere high like this monument you know there's a player camping up there and the truck one of its advantages it's got a massive field of view so you can use it to peek over walls almost behind buildings at times and of course you can use it to prepare or assaults so I just snuck up on this dude I would have done a takedown but they turn around at the last second so just time to give in the old hose down with the mp7 checking the loop here this guy parachutes again just it's absolutely wasting I don't think that guy's any damage to me but that's a really unfortunate landing right there chilling out at the monument here and I noticed an enemy vehicle on the mini-map yes that's a big disadvantage to doing this kind of thing because people can see you at all times if you're near by them but the Joker he doesn't mess around the joker does not mess around and while I'm buying this stuff I know that missile is gonna hit and it does fit further on I'm back in the truck this one didn't even see that happen completely by accident there was just a guy camping in a bush and I happened I just happened to run them over unbelievable carry on driving I think I saw this dude having a fight no getting away from that now because this is a Down you've got an opportunity here guys get out I'm a quick cheeky spray finish the job it's cool but it's so much fun it's so much fun let's get back in the truck so I'm just driving round and round in circles there's only three other players left in the game this one I call the hangover oh that's good that was a good one I really enjoyed that one but no one was shooting at me I think they were just scared maybe and I see this guy parachuting down I've got to go for that and I know that if I go down here protect the truck I'm gonna get out I just jumped out he was actually looking at the truck as a distraction so that thing that we talked about earlier worked quite well but I do get back in the truck and I managed to get out of there before the gas pushes in so now it's just a 1v1 it's me versus this guy now this guy seemed pretty on the ball he was damaging me seemed like he had good aim hiding behind the van and I want to say at this point guys at this point I finished this guy off with the mp7 won the game 18 kills happy days if I said that I'd be a liar but you decide if I won the game or not with that said thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like and maybe a share if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and before we go I just want to show you this last clip that I recorded yesterday as a reason not to use the Joker when on the side of the helicopter enjoy on the left on the left left button up here nice in happen then Jack I think the rocket at the top of the roller and killed mate yeah yeah but without true today [Applause] [Music]
