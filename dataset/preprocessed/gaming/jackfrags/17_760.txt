everyone hope you're doing well and welcome back to some more call of duty modern warfare season 2 so we played a couple days ago it's good fun getting stuck into the new content but today I'm going try hard mode now if you know me I'm not PIM I'm not being serious right now but basically I've changed up some of my gun loadouts went on Google I went on Google I was ok what are the best one of the best loadouts in the game now a lot of people really like the m13 right this one here this bad boy that's the m4a1 this bad boy and unfortunately I've not really used it that much so I haven't unlocked all of the like recommended attachments for it but I've got a few so I want to use the m13 a bit but I've also got the trihard mode loadout here as you can see that is the m4 and if we go into the gunsmith here most of the stuff that I needed I've unlocked now apparently a lot of the pros use this setup the only thing that I haven't unlocked that they use is the stock here the m16 grenadiers but everything else I have I even put a little gingerbread man on the side because you know why why the hell not right why but the gingerbread man it's got to be there but a lot of the other stuff is um it's legit so I'm gonna try it and just see how we do and I've also gone for frag the flash and then these perks apparently I'd like the go-to perks and that's supposed to be like the best secondary in the game subjective of course but there we go we'll see how it goes I might change things up but I'm really hoping that I get to play Ike here today because we didn't get to play on the stream the other day yeah this is a live stream at the moment and I am looking at the chat so if you're there right now say hi I can see a few people here already we've got Daniel last J rev o

him come flying around that corner it's like a jumping jack rabbit what is a jumping jack rabbit I don't know they're all these phrases that you hear from time to time and more often than not you don't know the history of them like where did they come from where did they go where did they come from cotton-eye Joe one of my favorites nuclear I used to love holding this area here like this was my jamm in cod4 this bit here last stream we were using the two new guns a growl and the striker I didn't realize this but the striker is basically it's the UMP isn't it I don't know maybe for some reason they couldn't use the name UMP though they had to go with striker because I know that some weapons some guns have like copyright on them don't they so games can't use the actual names of them there's a guy absolutely camping me right now it's still there right I'm sick of that we're not going that way sorry George thank you for the five what takeaway goes best with this stream I'll get a Chinese I reckon a Chinese Segway I would go for beef and black bean sauce with green peppers and mushrooms I'd get some boiled rice maybe and then maybe some chicken balls now that's it that's the UK Chinese takeaway right there I don't know what maybe the Chinese takeout in other countries is different oh of course the ran straight into a claymore rob film does the empire have different reload animations um I think it does Daniel Island said it's not actually the um-hmm oggi no I've not really played overwatch much recently no not played over what you want to say 15 years one behind me as well it's been a while I know that they've added a bunch of heroes in that game but no I haven't actually tried it for ages it's just not really appealed to me to be honest I got played it loads in the baser I make it round here yeah played it loads in the baser and then obviously it came out and I'd played it a lot then but I just got kind of bored a bit to be honest I don't know what it was obviously they've got overwatch 2 coming out soon I think the main focus of that though is the single player isn't it whoa I'm not sure I needed saying down the site there but I did anyway big problem for me in this game a be rich thanks to the 20 that's very kind here I appreciate that people's are tacticals out I think I hear them yeah so we go in full try on those today guys you're gonna be getting a sweat on you know it's nice about this map though because it's mostly indoors you're not constant you know I wasn't gonna say you're not constantly getting killed by explosions and beetles but you know the second that I said that some guy shows up with an RPG and ruins me my teammate so maybe I was wrong eh but it is nice to not get killed by these halls and cruise missiles all the time like I [Applause] didn't check right can't believe it gamer boy what are you thoughts on bf5 Eastern Front you mean like Russia if they actually do Russia I think it'd be super cool I'd love for them to do the eastern front one you like they could either do Russia versus the Germans or they could do I kind of want to see more of the u.s. in France you know us versus Germany and if you think about it they already have the US and the German models so they wouldn't have to make new models for the Russians although I think a lot of people would like to see Russia seeing as its World War 2 right and it's the world would see again so it makes sense see you later Star Wars done thank you for coming along puffy and I played the campaign twice it's great on this game yeah yeah the campaign on this is brilliant really really good [Music] why would you want the burst perk he's correct my ignorance but why would you want that Lord CEO Jack anything new about battle royale I might want to get Modern Warfare then I don't know I mean obviously there's been a few things that were leaked or shown in the last couple days but the only thing the infinity would have officially shown was what was in that trailer so I don't know I don't know what to say at this point I don't know what's real and what's not Elijah thank you view the to man hello Texas man how you doing so how old hello from India what's up how you doing Evan will you be my Valentine of course I will what's up Santo representing the Megalodon there thank you hey Tony was it Michael hatch hey infamous have you got the new guns yes I have burst of flavor makes the gun better I'm gonna try level this one up this map the m13 I know that syndicate uses it like I was watching syndicate stream miss I think it's one of his favorite guns but I don't have all the unlock spirit I like this map though it's cool map any gunfight later maybe I think they got rid of the they got rid of the sniper mode didn't they move you through snipers house one I played a bit out at the end of the last room hello I'm just gonna turn my game volume up a little bit so I can hear it better there we go what's up Dan extreme a be rich gives a legend thank you for the training again man where's that grenade come from I think there's someone on the other side of this wall here is this 10 B 10 yeah you know I've never actually played this map on 10 V 10 I think I've always played it on ground war and you not get round here you can it's not much going on it's such a big map isn't it have they ever done 20 be 20 on this map guys you know I'm sure you know when they did the reveal for this game Wow when they did the reveal for this game they had about some bucks on 20 v20 right or am I just going crazy do I want to go through there I feel like I don't let's say alright no one appeared there's usually people I haven't seen a single enemy out guys what's going on where are the enemies I mean apparently there are 10 of them now there's one first anymore see he gets me hey Mike what's up cruise missile that's for me what'd we miss yeah I feel like maybe this map needs more players flight works on ground war although I just get a bit hectic doesn't have a broken machine yeah it is a bit bizarre deep Alice isn't it you guys remember that map from bf3 that was the aftermath DLC right with the earthquakes think my memory serves me correctly buzzing noise I like that take your bet revenge there I wanted to get back in there how good is the growl ja I want to know because I will be out on it later and play using the first time the grouse okay it's alright I'm not leveled it up fully like I don't have all the attachments for it yet but I was using it a bit in the video the other day and also on the stream it's right I don't think it's gonna replace like the m4 or the kylo like I quite like the kylo think it's alright now this map is dead quiet man with this like little people this one else killed him I'm just trying to level this gum up right now so I can get the attachments that I need a sniper over there I don't really want to pick that again kind of do though because this sniper no I don't I'm scared I stay coming this way he's still up there ah someone else killed him Oh yet the blue laser beams in this way come this way one more for good luck thank you rich the really bad position oh come on yeah he's got like lasers coming out of him I saw the other day what is that son thank you for five I can drop shot too and I'm I'm a true Call of Duty planner I've learned the way I have learned the ways of the call of duty the ever triplane with south-african to see how it's like coming from a country that isn't really good when it comes to games and gaming if I ever played with the South African I mean maybe in public service yeah I'll see you up there I know that South African players have problems sometimes with service because there aren't that many in their region so I know like with with battlefield for example in the past I've actually done a couple of videos talking about it and asking for more service in that region for people that friendly or enemy underneath a man if you peek the wrong angle you just don't have time to get back in I it's so punishing to this game but yeah I know that um South African players sometimes have issues with servers and I have actually spoken about that before in a couple of my videos and I see a nail I swear I saw a nameplate down there no maybe not heat stroke it's a cool name they got a veto Jenny me that I slide bro sit right into my dams I'm not going in there he just ran up me I should have known he did that yeah my worst enemy defeated yeah this goes quite nice you know it's one of those ones that just barely used but once you start watching other people playing you read online like what's good and make a big difference like my favorite SMG in this game is the mp5 but you have to play so selective with that because of the range the damage at range is just not good with the smg's which is to be expected right do I have a snipe in this game very rarely I like sniping in gunfire ah I've got the wrong loadout I keep thinking I've got the flash just waste my stems now Wonderwall of unlocks y'all losing though on champ cruise missile I don't have one of these for years games gonna end before I use it over yeah I knew it I knew it we did it right and I'm in top bragger on my team that's fun Syd one I rock the mp5 as a secondary a lot are you saying the perfect I'll let you have to yeah the venomous you're right yeah the new SMG is is a bit more long-range it's cool Chris would would Jack keep up the great content thank you Sebastiano what's your favorite color black meanwhile I'm constantly getting my cheeks spread across the map for the mp5 scavenger and dead silence is a muscular rook have you watched Marco Marcos narcos Mexico season - no I've never seen narcos track the Odin the Odin hits really hard isn't it Pro Mode Jack gets stranding by or not you know what promo I didn't really play it that much I kind of got bored of it but I'd check out some reviews I've heard there's a lot of fetch quests and lots of walking but apparently it gets good towards the end but I don't know I'm the wrong person to ask I think for that the heroic sloth thank you for the - man we'd love to see more he'll let loose sure for sure really enjoy that game take it to rust and lever look quick Tony rust is insane though isn't it rust is just a crazy map like you either get killed all the time or you're the one getting the kills and you just get a Vsauce right away and then it's gg I don't actually unlock anything for it okay try it out wiggle wiggle domination okay they've got the stings down didn't they in this game the audios things still very good that was one of the best bits about bottom warfare and modern warfare 2 the audios things so good what are you oh man I should have dropped should have gone pro in there is this game free no it's not free I don't know how much it's probably still full price I would guess I'm not sure if they've had a sale or anything for it but no it's not free thought he was in there [Music] ah see how about a little hunt showdown on ps4 when it comes out you know what I've thought about that so hunt showdown is out on xbox and it's out on pc already it's only just been released on ps4 so I might maybe I don't know I was telling my friend Adam that I play with all the time I think a really good video to make right now would be a punch showdown beginner's guide a Playstation there's gonna be a lot of new players picking it up I don't really want to make that kind of video because I don't know how many people would want to watch that on my child because most people already know how to play on showdown that watch me sir are you gonna come up he's a guy just outside here I might weigh in here a second just there is right there they just capped it he's gonna capture that I'm gonna chill up here get it that's a big Kobe there I reckon didn't get a thing in here someone outside here trying to play a bit defensive here I could try and get a go dead silence ah dude it was so amazed I was gonna die in the way then I think feel like I should made that again I knew it if I donated it I may have not been killed then say sometimes you got to go with your gut go with your intuition that's nice pre-fire there that guy's just running around like an absolute mad lab with that who's either I don't like that I didn't realize that you could open that door every patients sometimes feel like there is someone there still securing prowl come on dead silence get ready you can't shoot through that car where doesn't it he's done it without cyber would be cooked would be cool to see you in tag in a 3v3 gunfights ornament look and maybe yeah you have a free bundle available in the in-game store you could possibly get a legendary mp5 flood variant I don't what that is why did I come out of a deer so now I do please scandal as I'm scared someone in here dead silence I mean it's it's strange because sometimes I feel like it

sniper here as one there's another one my brain was like too slow who killed you I used to know all the set knaves on this Moor on this map cod4 promod I think I've said this before but like when I used to play counter-strike competitively something that we did to blow off steam was just play cod for promod it's the organization that I was in had a pro Cod team as well so we would scream with them and they would teach us like their call-outs and the setting aids and everything let's go up on my right so that's what we would do we would just play Pro Mod and this map was like one of our favorites this go and just drills people how do they have an angle on me there sounds like the Golden Age yeah chill someone ran past there I'm just dead you dead yeah you're dead he was blending in

[Music] okay again down again I get down there pretty long trying to kill that guy Keegan hello from Alaska Joe CR said Jeff watch respects summer specs on this PC I nine nine nine hundred K and I've

I've not changed my spec in a while though I'm not like upgrading in ages anyone I [Music] think you've got a stem addiction now right Chris Stenberg I could never talk and play like you did it's difficult Chris but it takes practice it takes practice because you have to try and concentrate on most like three things at once right because I'm trying to concentrate on playing the game I'm trying to look at you guys talking in the chat and asking questions and then processing those questions in my head and then commentating there's like three things that you've got to worry about but it's just practiced that's all it is honestly when when I started doing this when I started YouTube and started live-streaming I was terrible I was like how do I do this like what what am i doing but the more you practice you get better you get a lot better on it so what's um where's gun game Kill Confirmed capture the flag gun game oh I'm glad that they just call it gun game I like a bit of gun game me

when they started indeed when Daisy came out it gave us a load of experiences that no other game gave us but there were so many problems with it and it just was so stagnant for so long I had my fun with it but I think it's done now unless they come out with like a brand new game or something you know Moonman thank you for the tank you win some you lose some indeed it's a big mark for gun game

they're gonna have to play it safe go modern-day and release the product that is bug free and has a ton of content they've got more time to make the next battlefield game they've said it's not coming until fiscal year 2022 so that probably means that it will release October November 20 21 they've got far more time on development than they had with bf5 and they've probably already started working on the game like years ago so it just got to play it safe I think go modern warfare go next gen brand-new engine show us what the new frostbite can do and just hit it hard man okay it would be cool if
