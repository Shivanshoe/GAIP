you want to check it out for yourself and we I'm gonna take a look around London stop harassing that man no punch the wrong guy I'm sorry no oh he's punching me now right now he's okay dived on him get off just relax okay I gotta go there we go so this is Westminster Bridge I recognise this like they've done it so well the detailing everyone it's very good that's a McDonald's in real life I think and that's an aquarium yeah I went there last year I don't live in London but like I've been there a fair bit and oh it's so cool to recognize these places still chasing me back off oh you don't give now hey I'm Jack we don't take any prisoners these pigeons do it cuddy pigeons or seagulls I think they're seagulls I was never any good at wildlife May but this is the Millennium wheel welcome to London good please from that so I'm gonna go find a lady that are profiled and the reason I want to Gary is because she's a spy and spies in this game I've cars with missiles so I've hacked this drone here and I can now fly this is one of the quickest ways of getting around London wouldn't recommend doing it at the moment I don't even know if these drones are real to be honest with you but the shards looking good from there I found a spider bot and I'm gonna try and put the spider bot on the drone I just want to see if it's possible miss the jump right come out of that now and then go back on the drone is it gonna stay on there when I fly it's working so now I've got a drone and a spider boyfriend and here's the woman would despite rate one a time recruit he's good talk to me oh so you are that sec I've been wanting to meet you we see you've been patching up holes at the NHS you're pretty good not good enough to stop Klan Kelly they store many hundreds of organs before I was able to seal the exploit well that doesn't sound good I want to take back what they stole but I'm hardly a match for these gangsters on my own yeah all right I'll rally the comrades okay so she's been stopping people stealing organs using me an exploit in the NHS so we've got to go and find an ambulance that's got stolen organs in and steal it back and give it back to the NHS there it is I'm sure they'll never see me come in put it down what can I do with this little spider bot then can I attack people with it have a go you can I attack you know I'll be detected no they just kill the spider bot right you gonna pay now I've got my paintball gun bit of a destruction cover him in pain that's a hard hit paintball girl let me tell you tell you what I've been paintballing it didn't knock people out so I don't know what's in this right here's the ambulance I suppose my friend would like it if you took the organs to a hospital you eat the organs maybe I should upon this I don't know how I don't know where to go okay there's the exit for its locus so go figure out how to open it up you could have made this easy I know that was an expensive jacket and I was covered in pain not hoodie you can't wash that out mate right here it is if only I'd have just spent two seconds plumbing excuse me our blogs commentary I just like to hide things as I Drive see what happens hacks act like a bracelet I jump the bus oh no I didn't that didn't work check this out Tower Bridge this is awesome like it looks so much like this strange there's the gherkin I recognize all of this so weird civilians move God good job it's an ambulance all goons delivered well done I'll let the hospital staff know about this special delivery while you call our hacker friend sweet so we've done her a favor and now we recruit her so we can switch to her after business guys the only reason why I wanted to get your own business a car with missiles can you get any more James Bond guy this is too much that was an exactly likes a barrister but they'd sorry I can't just drive around willy-nilly shoes hello whistles more like fireworks I found a really speedy moped stop people in their tracks like that oh wait wait no I want to raise that raise it up hey Kylie are we cool you've got the wrong guy no this is a mess I'm out there bye what did I just do I'm not so menace his moped is rapid move but airborne I'm airborne how is that not killed me that's fine is it spies also pretty good espionage reverse the car into the explosive barrels boom and now we're going in an town calm that's not good but a few beers good sound that is and they've done a good pewpew there so yeah sounds good the next I want to see if I can drive this giant bowl some kind of military bow if a hacker should be able to jump up there let's subdue the driver let's chill oh I didn't I didn't mean to kill him but yeah you can drive the boat there you go big military boat on the Thames that's cool check these guys out this dude's got a nice heart got old-school bowler hat Shakespearian he's got slow hacking and frail why don't never crew him oh she's another spy dearly they put her on the list for layer maybe no I'm doing a Batman thing now for reconstruction so our contact was here and they got jumped by an armored van Jesus yes it certainly doesn't look like his best day does it analyse the clues in the AR workspace to find out what happened to him they kill him this is a non-lethal weapon so odds are he's still alive though he may not want to be that's painful we picked him up [Applause] put them in the truck and where did they go they've taken IRS contact away but they may still be nearby I can reconstruct the vehicles path from Hunter short CCTV recordings that should allow you to follow it I've completed a thorough analysis of the vehicle have concluded it is a van what else well I could also mention that the my new traces of sanded the tire tracks indicate that it's been on a construction site recently but you know me hate to sound like a smartass hmm so the contact was taken here but because I've recruited someone who's a construction worker I can now switch to her and that means that I'll be able to get in the construction site and walk around a bit incognito cuz it looks like I fit in kind of like a hitman thing this woman also has a giant wrench which I'm big fan of in fact I'm gonna use it right now smash oh rip there really did you have to hit him there nothing the contacts in here easy easy I'm with dedsec you called us of course you shouldn't have come here now they know for sure effort rayful we just saved you [ __ ] no you've just done just both that was rude good shot oh nothing to see here they're out there that's quite a straightforward thing because I have that costume on and this is a shard it's the tallest building in London I've never been in it though but I've heard it's good because they've got restaurants and apartments and shops in there all sorts but in this game it seems it's uh it's been taken over by Nexus whoever they are right you ready for some sick moves boom send me everything over and they said it was restaurants and shops but I found nothing but pain they don't want me here maybe it's cuz of the guns I don't know well I think I'm gonna leave it there guys thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed that let me know
