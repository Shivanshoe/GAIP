sit back and let me tell you the story of how this website teasing the call of duty 2020 reveal was discovered it's a bit of a crazy winding journey but certainly an interesting and unique way to begin marketing a video game over the course of the last few days myself and other content creators were sent mysterious boxes in the mail on top of each box there was a unique serial number a mechanical dial lock and a letter the letter warned not to open the box until monday 10th of august at 12 pm eastern time it also requested the recipient to text the unique serial number on the box to a phone number at that time to receive the correct combination for the lock and open it to see what's inside and so that time came around upon sending a message to the number a response was received and the combination for the lock on my box was 38 right 24 left and 38 right and with that i could gain access an inside was something i was not expecting on the top a confusing letter that read as follows these are top secret documents containing compartmentalized information essential to national security you are requested to immediately distribute the provided intelligence to your operatives in the field these materials are to be used in the investigation of site redacted in the euro mountains please ensure that your package contains the document listed in the column marked manifest you will also be supplied a projector to aid in distributing the materials and then on the right hand side there's lots of letters and number combinations with x's next to them and underneath all of the protective packaging a projector and a box of slides filled with 35 millimeter film in my case the projector was the vintage gaff 2680 slide projector and i believe that this model was manufactured in the 1970s as you can see they've gone for that faux wood finish on the top and luckily for all of us it came with a manual and so we set the projectors up loaded in the slides and this is what we saw rings of letters grids with hollow circles and coloured circles pictures of paris london tokyo moscow and new york with numbers on them what looked like satellite pictures of a mountainous location very confusing indeed it was soon discovered after that that each content creator had received different slides some of them were the same but some unique and so the community began to collate all of the information and compile it together with the vain hope of deciphering what this was nothing came up but then all of a sudden a random update dropped for black ops 4. this was no coincidence and looking back at the slides some of them were portions of a multiplayer level from black ops called summit this level was in the first game but as it turns out they also made a version of it for black ops 4 2. and so if you loaded up that level and took a look around you may have noticed some changes that were made coloured numbers on certain walls in the control center the computer screens displayed new images and they did bear a resemblance to those on the projector slides so what if they matched up in some way and here is the kicker on the wall in the same room there are five clocks hanging up frozen in time paris moscow tokyo new york london the same locations as on the numbered slides obviously these were all connected in some way and so the community set out to decipher a puzzle without going too in-depth into the process two coded phrases were uncovered from this if you rotated the slides in certain ways and matched them up with the red dots and then overlaid them on top of each other and used the in-game computer screens you could spell out the phrase turn 11 white and then the clocks well each of them were stuck at different times and by figuring out which clock related to which coloured letter wheel and number you could use the hands of the clock to pick out letters and in the correct order this spelt at the phrase bish you were here bishop here is a reference to a famous chess match that took place in 1972 at the world chess championship between challenger bobby fischer of the united states and defending champion boris baskey of the soviet union some have dubbed it as the match of the century and it is known for one of the worst blunders in chess ever as it transpired the american fisher won the match ending 24 years of soviet domination of the chess world championship with former world chess champion gary kasparov describing fish's win as a crushing moment in the midst of the cold war tensions were high and there's the link back to black ops so if we look at turn 11 white from the bishop we're here match as the clues instructed us to the white pawn took the black pawn d takes c5 and this is the final clue it was then discovered that if you go to porntextporn.com you end up here an old tv set powered down a map of the dansk the warzone map in the top right the white pawn defeating the black pawn a 1980s computer setup poster for chopper command which was one of activision's earliest ever video game releases on the atari from 1982 a strange looking telephone device and most importantly what looks like a vhs player or an alarm clock flashing a date and a time friday the 14th of august at midday this is definitely the right place and the final destination in the current alternate reality game so what will happen on friday at noon well i'd imagine something will change on this website or we will get some kind of video teaser here for the next call of duty game perhaps the tv will turn on interestingly these type of tv sets have recently been added in game on the call of duty warzone map so we can guess that perhaps some type of in-game event will be occurring too and only time will tell the most interesting thing to me about this though is that obviously call of duty warzone will carry on going and with that map being there in the top right and being connected and teased with the new call of duty game this year that does tell me that it will continue and potentially be updated with a new map or to look and feel like the cold war era of the new game how they do this i've got absolutely no idea i don't know if they've got the capacity to do live events i hope they do i think that would be the most energetic and dramatic way of doing things imagine if you were in game playing warzone all of a sudden there's a big flash in the sky and newt goes off whatever and the entire map changes and you're left somewhere completely no how cool would that be with that said that's the end of the story for now and i hope that you've enjoyed this look at the latest cod 2020 reveal easter egg and congratulations to everyone that worked hard on putting this together i'm sure it was a massive task and
