star wars squadrons has just been revealed by motive LucasArts and ei we got to see a gorgeous cinematic trailer just now but sadly no gameplay that will come at a play however there was a ton of gameplay information released online and plenty that we already know about the game so in this video I'll explain everything that's revealed so far and I think there's enough here to get a good idea of what the gameplay will actually be like so this game is pitched as an authentic Starfighter combat experience set after the events of Return of the Jedi the Empire is on its knees but still has an army to fight with after the fall of the second Death Star the Emperor and Darth Vader so in this game you'll be flying for either the Imperials who are still intent on stamping out anyone that oppose them or the New Republic in terms of that gameplay then well Star Wars squadrons is said to be an immersive first-person space dogfighting experience that will feature 5 vs. 5 multiplayer dogfights monumental fleet battles and an original story set during the final days of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the New Republic after the events of Return of the Jedi the game will launch on October the 2nd 2020 only a few months away really on PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC on Origin Steam and the epic game store it's nice to see the EA are diversifying when releasing their games and it will also be playable via virtual reality on PlayStation 4 and PC with cross-platform supports and that one was quite a surprise to me I thought that VR was kind of done for this gen but it's cool to see this game will still be supporting it I don't know if any you guys played the PSP our Star Wars mission The Criterion created I think it's still one of the best VR experiences that you can have in gaming at the moment so this could be really something special also at the end of the trailer it did say in small writing that it was made up of frostbite engine cinematics so perhaps it's safe to assume that this game does in fact run on the frostbite engine 2 which means that it would be the first cross-platform frostbite engine game I imagine that it's also going to look pretty incredible too if you remember in 2017 when battlefront 2 launched we had Starfighter assault and back then the graphics on that were just insane so in 2020 with engine updates I'm really expecting something nice here also motive the studio that developed this have worked on the frostbite engine before as they created the single-player story for Star Wars Battlefront 2 now in regards to squadrons in Frayser who is the creative director on the project had this to say we created this game for every Star Wars fan who's ever dreamt about soaring across the galaxy in their favorite star fighter through the collaboration of the teams that motive and Lucasfilm we've been able to create a high fidelity star fighter experience with an authentic storyline that invites Star Wars fans to explore never-before-seen corners of the galaxy in their own ship when everything begins you'll enlist as a Starfighter pilot stepping into the cockpits of iconic star fighters from both the New Republic and Imperial fleets and then your planned skirmishes with your squad in the briefing room before taking off for space battles across the galaxy players will engage in strategic 5v5 multiplayer space battles with the goal of demolishing the opposition flagship in fleet battles and will feel the rush of first-person multiplayer combat as they work with their squadron to defeat as many opponents as possible in dogfights pilots will triumph as a team adjusting the composition of their squadrons to suit their playstyle as they progress pushing their opponents and completing objectives across known and never-before-seen locations including the gas giant at Yavin prime and the shattered moon of gala time the game will also offer rich cosmetic and gameplay customization options with rewards and bonuses that are earned solely through gameplay as players move up the ranks they'll earn components such as weapons holes engines and shields to customize the performance of their star fighters and gain cosmetic items to customize their cockpit ship exteriors and appearance of their pilot so that's really interesting it's almost like your ship is the character of the game and you can add modifications tune things install different components to effect I guess how it handles the speed versus the damage the agility accuracy the payload or that kind of stuff it sounds like this will be a highly strategic 5v5 competitive space game in addition to this as we mentioned you will be able to squad up with friends and play against other people regardless of what platform you're on cross play will be supported on Xbox one Playstation 4 PC and VR it's great to see that what about that single-player story then will it's said that that will bring to life the events that follow the Battle of Endor that's in Return of the Jedi when the Rebel Alliance has successfully destroyed Death Star - and through that story players will learn what it means to be a pilot as they battle from the alternating perspectives of two customizable pilots one of them serving in the New Republic's heroic Vanguard squadron while the other fights for the galactic empires fearsome Titan squadron the authentic story features a diverse cast of original characters as well as some cameos from familiar faces in the Star Wars galaxy I'm pretty sure at one point in the trailer we do in fact see wedge antilles who's featured in several Star Wars movies and also come on that has to be hera syndulla from Star Wars rebels if it's not then who else could it be in terms of the ships that you'll be flying in and against I definitely saw x-wings y-wing bombers you wings a wings I saw a tie bomber a tie interceptor a TIE fighter there are a couple of transport ships in the background too as well as Mon Calamari Star Destroyers and Ventus and that's about all the solid gameplay information that we have so far but I think from that we can extrapolate a few ideas and thoughts about what a 5v5 match of this game is actually going to be like well I reckon that the key part of this will be picking your team's composition so there's obviously different classes of starships in here you've got bombers interceptors your average x-wing and TIE fighter and within those you can modify them to adjust their attributes do you want something more tanky do you want something that can do more damage a bit of a glass cannon something in between I found this on the websites as well it says that you can modify your ship and divert the power between its systems and destroy your opponents in strategic space Don fites so not only can you set up your ship before the battle begins and coordinate with your team but also during the battle it seems that you can shift things around to try and turn the fate of a dogfight in your favor and just going back to the team composition I'm guessing that you could have a couple of bombers but at the same time you could have just three x-wings or do you want to x-wings one you wing one bomber and then an a wing to run interference because it seems like the 5v5 mode all revolves around taking out the opponents bigger ship which I'm assuming will either be a Star Destroyer or a Mon Calamari in my head I'm thinking it's a asymmetric PvP game where you think of each starship has its own class or character with different skills and abilities and how well does that work against the enemy team's composition I suppose one of the biggest questions from most people watching the trailer today and consuming all of that information would be how much depth is there going to be in this game because with it being a Star Wars game you have to assume that it should be as accessible as possible or have they just completely thrown that away and there's a ton of depth and strategic plays and all sorts of different things that you can do here we just don't know at the moment replayability yeah that has to be a really important consideration for this kind of game because once you've played the single-player would you want to play through it again from the other perspective how many maps are there going to be and also they did mention these bigger fleet battles does that mean that you'll be able to go in with more than just five players could we get like 32 versus 32 space battle that would be pretty crazy but I'd love to see that I have to be honest with that said do let me know your thoughts on star wars squadrons down in the comments below are you liking the look of this game not liking it let's see what you have to say if you enjoyed the video
