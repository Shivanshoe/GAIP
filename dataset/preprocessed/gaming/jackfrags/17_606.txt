hi everyone and welcome to part three of uncharted 4. so we left it on a bit of a cliffhanger over here myself and sully we managed to climb the tower break the floor went down we solved a little puzzle and figured out our next location but on the way up rafe has found us and he's on the way over so we're gonna have to get out of here fast see if we can meet up with sam and get the hell out of here slowly i think that's sam's tower that's definitely sam's tower come on this way it blew it up me excuse me how long you think before rape gets here let's not stick around to find out all these

i mean this is so cinematic right now i'm loving this hey that's my get out of my truck i think i have to wait until it's a bit closer and be mindful of the chickens that's the most important part that's really difficult to aim ah where'd you come from go for it yes we're in hello hi we've taken that vehicle now it's us well sam's up ahead i've got to get a bit closer i think hey stay away nice oh this is tough get up there nate quick get on punch him ah i think i have to like shoot a couple of them first and then i can move up a bit oh we got a good checkpoint there that was nice [Music] yes i just like one of those bikes that'd be great keep moving up g by g hey sam oh that's hey get off please get off how do i stop you okay get out my jeep all right someone's in for a bashing here

nathan just grab there we go there we go no blooming we could have survived it right chanted that's not good all right we're gonna have to shoot these dudes that was close [Music] oh no [Music] i'm sick and tired of this stupid thing here take this hey give me a little microwave oh no die already oh that did a bit of damage i think it actually did how we doing back there i'm trying my best oh we can see the engine come on we can do it i hate this truck i do as well i do as well david why won't you die right it's on fire keep going keep going holy [ __ ] finally yeah you good oh yeah all right let's get out of here oh that was intense it kind of was like having a t-rex chasing you yeah oh hey what there's some serious armor piercing nine millimeters yeah all right i think the coast is clear yeah all right this looks like a simple cipher forgotten liberty it means their damn motto all the paradise references i can't really miss them see you two made it out okay way better than okay we found libitalia liberty flipper what are you libertalia seems avery founded the legendary pirate colony i was more of a pirate utopia really okay but what about the treasure see as the story goes this place provided a safe haven for hundreds maybe even thousands of pirates and they they shared everything property resources and they kept it all in one common treasury building okay so where is this commie pirate sanctuary right here that island just northeast of kings bay the reef has a copy of this yeah well by the time ray figures it out we'll be well on our way to libertalia i'm telling you that treasure is as good as ours [ __ ] lol how's the malaysia job going nate i told you they always know seems like you're a hair off course elaine it's it's not what it looks like really because what it looks like is that you're searching for henry avery's buried treasure and given the shoreline soldiers that are all over town i'd bet you're not the only ones looking for it all right well i i guess it's kind of what it looks like but but i can explain look it's going to sound crazy join me well for starters um this is sam it's my brother sam drake my brother i'm sorry i i thought he had died in a panamanian jail but i was obviously very wrong he's been stuck in there for 15 years and it's because of me and the guy who broke him out wants a lot of money and the only way we can pay off the debt is avery's treasure that's the good news we found it it's it's on an island just off the coast stop was there ever a malaysia job it was a lie it was all a lie come on wait elena wait i don't get you look i i wanted to tell you you know what enough no i wanted to but how could i i don't know just say it i had to protect you that is [ __ ] nate you just didn't have the nerve to face me again i knew you would react like this how would you react you lied to me for weeks if you were killed i i wouldn't have even known about it and now you have a brother who are you come on i'm me come on it's me it's different this time i have to save him i don't even care about the treasure the look on your face when you walked into this room if you're done lying to me then you should stop lying to yourself ruined i got a plane to catch you do what you have to do [Music] how did you find him hey hey what are you doing go after her we're not done here well maybe we should be what are you saying i'm saying maybe there's a smarter way to save sam such as such as we give him a new identity we we put him in hiding somewhere right he's been in prison for 15 years he's not going into hiding okay fine you go after your wife sam and i will head off for libertalia without me come on you'll get both of you killed really kid i've been doing this for a hell of a long time i think i might be able to hang out you want to be helpful sullivan go keep an eye on her the team's falling apart it's ruined dream's over whatever you say you need a hand got it let's go pack your bags [Music] [Music] oh this must be the start of the game nathan well there abouts [Music] we think about that that's pretty cool take the wheel for a second all this running around surviving by the skin of my teeth i think we've actually taken a moment i need to step back and appreciate just how far we've come sick part of this man supervisor yeah listen little brother she will get over it and we bring back a treasure like that anyone would i don't know maybe i've uh done this one too many times huh somehow i imagined it bigger yeah well we're definitely in the right place it'll find us a spot to set ashore oh i mean at least there's an island right yeah at least there's an island just keep an eye out for anything man-made ah you mean pirate bay sure i don't know if that is the one from the start of the game i don't think so maybe libitalia is more of a small beachside shack yeah maybe it's a treehouse maybe avery spent his entire fortune setting up this treasure hunt and ran out of money to actually build never tells you oh that's man-made clearly thank you up there well that definitely qualifies as man-made pirate maid all right let's check it out i mean a pirate that's that's a man isn't it or a woman so yeah that's man-made pirate made though i don't know about that it's dangerous yeah hold on look at this water look at this this game does several different biomes extremely well you're traveling all over the place and everywhere looks great it's a stark contrast to where we were in madagascar with the desert are there any crabs surely there's crabs there's always crabs there's no crabs guys uh [Music] oh maybe i can't get up there oh look at this whoa wonder what this guy did uh maybe he wouldn't stop singing the c shankies yeah that's probably it yeah that's it let's have a look around here there are some stairs there that we could climb up oh my goodness look at that wow i'm half expecting to see a skull like caved into the rock somewhere oh yeah there's some more man-made structures over there it's fine bit of a cave here could head over there but there must be a way up here i want to check that out the crabs are raving is that what they do i've seen a few crab raves in my time i'm just having fun exploring this place looks awesome what are you doing sam you came over here in a bit of a hurry didn't you yep yeah i can't climb up there [Music] looks like there's a small bridge there that i could use maybe what's this treasure huh it's a door of some kind oh covering a chamber a massive chamber for storing a bunch of treasure no way not with his ego wherever avery put the treasure is going to be the most elaborate place we've seen yet and it would be well protected too that makes sense he's been quite elaborate so far let's see if we can spot something from up there okay up we go it's assassin's creed time again this one doesn't look that tall watch out for seagulls heck your eyes out see this way i don't know if you guys have seen that movie the lighthouse bad luck to kill a goal that's all i'll say i never insult a man's cooking this looks promising it's the star trek logo huh some kind of symbol engage chevron arrow yeah looks like a compass arrow how did you know to do that well there's one thing i've learned from you press everything down there it's the same symbol another arrow it's pointing over there let's go find out where it's pointing huh come on boat's right below us yep right let's just jump in why don't you use the rope and rappel down yeah you know what sam that's a great idea way quicker that way there was a mission that i played in sea of thieves that this is reminding me of but obviously this was a few years before sea of thieves so who copied who huh over there next hopefully i've not beached this follow these arrows see where they go pointing over here isn't it hey look another arrow over there that one's pointing over here out to sea oh there's another one there is that television to dig there or do i just keep going is there another one up here there's one okay we've got to go left i haven't seen another one yet unless i've missed it i wonder if it's the shipwreck here nathan over there it's ship it's something oh it's not the one that one's telling me to go back we'll just have a look here there might be some treasure here or a clue oh my guys look at this this is under here the whole time are you kidding me wow i think maybe i'll miss one of the arrows but we'll go back i just want to have a look at this if i can stop being stuck that'd be great marco hollow is that the only reason that you come here just did the marco polo i remember that from i think that was uncharted two [Music] marco who's marco forget it sam can i can you let me back in join our little adventure yes i'd love that thank you yeah i must have missed one whoa it probably asked me to go and land i'd imagine i guess that one is going to point over there somewhere i'm sure there's an uncharted game where you're swimming around in a pool you do marco polo that one's pointing over here i'd drive over it again slow down a little bit there it is looks like that one's pointing to that cave over there hey we can take the boat in there sam's all right it fits oh wow secret cave stairs this looks promising yes it does there's another one there man we're lucky no one ever found this place this whole thing would be a tourist attraction yeah this place would be covered in instagram influencers i suppose we could dive under here i didn't see anywhere that we could climb up did i just miss it what about this big pillar in the middle of the cave that looks climbable yeah that could work get all the way up there where's the first grabby let's see one we might have to get the boat jump off the boat move it back a little bit we put it about here like that that's fine i think you can jump on top yeah here we go you got it got away seagulls pretty cool what climbing this cliff yes climbing this cliff on a giant secret pirate island i mean come on yeah that's cool well i think it's pretty damn cool nathan's just seen too many awesome things he's just like ah nothing excites me anymore apart from treasure and that's it imagine the calluses on the fingers scares me to death do you reckon this avery guy beta tested all this stuff and was like yeah if i can do it someone else can do it [Applause] all right back in business okay hold on just gotta not fall to my death over here it'll be fine oh yes avery wasn't much for subtlety or understatement was it well he had the money you got it flown it right so does this qualify as the most elaborate place we've seen yet it's up there that's damn impressive who built all this for him he must have paid someone to do all this right he didn't do it all himself so he had all his construction workers sign nda's pirate ndas back in the day picture perfect postcard that is oh look the main entrance is blocked by debris again well i guess avery's builders clearly didn't take hundreds of years of erosion into account clearly gonna need to find another way around see climb is here nature has been kind to us hey sam come on give me a hand with this yeah sure lots of lifting and crawling under things huh the glamorous life of a treasure hunter treasure hunters nowadays walk around fields with metal detectors pray that's what they do i think we'd jump onto that ledge there i've never found any treasure in real life i feel sad and i still wish that billionaires would just build this in real life as a piece of entertainment you suppose this place was there's somewhere to go archers remind me of the saint dismiss cathedral but i don't know [Music] oh rope bridge up there come on see what you can find up there you got it well there's a path but i don't see another way up yet so hold on that's gonna break his neck and fall down [Applause] you okay at least i'm on the other side okay i still need to get you up here hang tight too predictable sam anything damn hey you still there god damn it has he left me let's see here i ruined my marriage drove my best friend away two psychos in their army after me and now my brother's gone missing good day his nights no one around to tell me i'm an idiot i can just hear sully saying it now oh there he is you're already up here where were you finding a way to get you up here all right let's jump across in thanks everything all right yeah everything's fine let's keep going okay i have a feeling i'm going to need that box for something now he wants to go check out the view there's a rappel there that we could use nice view you didn't hear me when back there i called out to you i didn't hear you why were you worried i was worried you got distracted i'm distracted now what's that supposed to mean nothing shall we yeah let's can i i was gonna start i was just about to jump onto that from here but maybe you have to use this move out the way seagulls nathan drake coming through will anything hang on a sec sam no good it's a dead end all right we're head on back then that's strange that was bait [Music] why would they do that now what there's got to be a way across spider-man i mean i don't think i could eat myself all the way across there just gonna check this out here there's a weird cross here it's above him okay thanks for telling me again maybe there was something i missed down there have a look i could try and swing to that maybe that's too far go down a bit [Music] we try and jump on that there i don't know where that would lead though swinging around try a big jump i'm not gonna make it not that way he didn't do the grabby thing could i drop down to that there now what there's got to be a way across no no no [Music] i don't know if we could tie anything to the box we don't need that you're already up here let's keep going no you can't if i go this way if i put the rope here and then drop down maybe try that i should be able to get to the ledge this way yeah that's it so we can reach that now there's a path down here right behind you there we go right there's a swing there so that's going to be a big jump isn't it and now we can reach it look at that get to the top here watch out son go go yeah ow i just broke both my elbows they're shattered how you doing not this way how you doing this is interesting because usually it is quite straightforward sam in here but this is almost baiting you into trying different things i kind of like that it's not so obvious requires a bit more thought process all right looks like we're still on the right track sweet there's another tower here that we can check the hell did no one find this i'm going to assume there's another symbol up here or an arrow maybe again pointing us somewhere else there's nothing at the top could be something in here you just see the island down there that almost just pushed me off the edge that would have been nasty as treasure it's a hat it looks like a beanie hat or something oh yeah it's an ottoman helmet i thought i recognized it right that looks like the right way there what do you think son we just give it all up make a home here it's a nice place you he doesn't have anything to say you sped up with me that looks like death down there that's the way that i just came up isn't it yeah that's where we started [Music] oh there's a hook there i see so we've got to get on there and then jump across and we can swing call exploring oh big slide oh come on game you could have given me that one you could have given me that one we looks like we're heading down careful ah ah that worked out it still works it's the advert isn't it the guy drops his mobile phone he's the second biggest sister i've ever seen wait wait where was the biggest i'll tell you later come on let's get down there slide [Music] sam come around this way we're in holy [ __ ] all right you're doing okay yeah piece of cake get down here now right this second it's so tropical look at this place wow what is all this it's hogwarts sam check out this diorama uh that looks like a city street i think they actually built all this stuff these guys i don't know anymore is that ever oh no really well made what's it say don't tell sam look hey uh maybe they were planning a massive yeah that's what i'm saying dude pirate why isn't that come on disney amazon someone bill gates build it please we've already looked at this did i miss something on it oh maybe you just pick it up and have a look at it is it swim time water is calling me where are the fish that's what i want to know why are there no fish here this game doesn't have fish ai one out of ten did some come through there lots of supplies in here tools seeds provisions probably past their cell by date they don't need anything some dangerous all right it's getting a bit more ominous down here this looks like the right direction i've seen that before here we go mechanism is busted or something no no no no no no one way or another we're getting in there let's just lift it together all right okay dale okay let's do this oh come on this is heavy just think about all that treasure yeah mostly just thinking about my back i think it if there's a load of treasure how are we going to get it on the boat someone's got to move it whoa well looks like we got ourselves another trial that sure looks like it looks like a pirate ship whale let's see what these do right so does one of those have that symbol [Music] i can rotate what can i symbols all right that'll help but the one at the top is rotating so you have to put it on one of these things to turn it like that symbols on the spheres don't match the ones in the light okay so that one will go in there right what's that rotating is there a light on the top bro no it doesn't look like it come back a bit [Music] so i thought that m1 was right i don't know what happened there is it it has to go the other way around maybe like that well that's correct there is an arrow there one side dark one side light hmm the left needs to be a half moon okay i'm struggling to understand what i have to do here i thought that would maybe i'm just looking at the wrong thing here [Music] like that oh i see i get it i get it [Music] but it needs to be the other way around still yeah i see what i have to do now so that's a yeah that's the wrong way around we put that one there rotate it like this there we go so that's step one i think that will do something there we go yeah there we go we got it what is that oh look statues pirate captains there's bonnie uh baldridge oh i can't look at that guy's name so we've got a diagonal one so who was this al basra character uh he was a muggle one of the soldiers on the gun's way what's he doing teaming up with avery he got free during the battle and blew up the gun's way he's done that one's right spinning both symbols at once yeah keep going so that should just spin that one and then we can put that back wait all the way around like that [Music] is there another one no there's not another one so what's wrong with that then [Music] oh i see the big bit i get it i'll get it it has to be the other way around [Music] there you go now you just gotta get him into the yeah lights gone too far there keep going one more that's it [Music] nope that's not it i wish they would turn quicker it's so annoying they turned so slow the one before that isn't it [Music] went too far again [Music] oh there's number two here we go again we got let's see ferrell and how does it i mean his history knowledge is so good hey look symbols on the ring are constantly rotating oh good so now i've got to get it on the right rotation there's two oh yeah there he is what's he doing so far from the barbary coast tell me where the action is [Music] try that oh that needs to go a little bit further there maybe [Music] okay gotta track how far off they are when they're in the light that one's fine [Music] a couple more times i think you got it there we go oh that was an annoying puzzle and the last of us richard what edward england and thomas what's up boys look this that's where we're going oh wait wait wait a minute that's only 11 pirates missing our star pirate uh-huh it's kind of weird where's the main man there's guy brush escape from monkey island there's nothing there sam sorry let's see it's an elevator that's cool where to now [ __ ] you're missing avery statue you know i'm starting to get the feeling that our friend was a bit of a nurse 100 you think let's go see what he's got in store for us he's got a spyglass he's looking over there jump sam you jump yeah deal yeah he's off he didn't want to jump so nathan and be honest with me how does this stack up you know compared to your other adventures ask me again when we finish get on the zip line don't snap don't snap don't snap it's fine come on son didn't snap sweet get your butt down here right now come on down votes down there it's always easier on the way down isn't it what's your problem sam get in the boat right now there's no sharks it's okay okay island with monstrous avery statue is to the right i'm so excited my hand my hands are literally shaking yeah i know the feeling guys either that or i just i need another cigarette maybe a little bit of both there he is he's talking about larger than life yeah he's big he's a big lad oh he's pointing over there i think we should go and investigate there's a bit of a storm picking up isn't there looks like he's got a spy glass maybe he wants us to look through it okay i'm sure i've done this in sea of thieves yeah i don't like this uh storm here not a big fan of that this was right now like where we started hey come on sam oh no no you do the honors i insist come on okay eat me up there what are we looking at it's the island from the start of the game [Music] joe big skull-shaped island what big island no skull that's got to be it the battalion that's optimistic considering everything you know it is just us here you're allowed to feel just a little bit of excitement over this well i'll get excited when we get alcazar's noose off your neck come on okay what i said okay no no no no your okays are never just okay it usually means the opposite is okay who the hell else [ __ ] how is he tracking us we destroyed the phones and everything unless sam is working with him or something hey guys ah all right come on marooned i gotta get off this beach sam sam can you hear me it's nice and dry here i'm just staying here oh [ __ ] sam god damn it just assembled no megalodon are you there they do look like megalodon teeth don't they sam is not here oh thank god our supply box oh my gosh of course everything's gone it's all been taken why don't we just swim out to see an end all just i'm sick of treasure bright side can't lose anything else besides my life talking to myself that's that's the first sign of crazy i think you were already crazy night jesus okay i'm all oh right just push through just push through it come on gotta go across he's got no strength you can't make the jumps that you usually make he's got to climb oh look at that keep going that's awesome looks like the thundercats logo come on nate you can do it all he wants is a big mac milkshake and some large fries that's it i'll reach it what oh there's one up there i didn't see that one that looks slippy how are you holding on to this i don't understand yeah i was going to say you should slip nice bit up now it's gg gg no ray uh yes i sick purvis magna sam where are you crap [Music] that's exactly how i would describe it i'm coming to you well i've got normal speed back now he's had a bit of a rest he's feeling better he just pounded six liters of g fuel it's fine we're on track to meet deadline oh i wonder if he imagined that i don't think so uncharted doesn't really do that kind of stuff but he didn't in the past at least that's hell down there still another row no no come on why did he just go no no no no no no no no that's fine just calm down everything's okay okay what nice hey off we go i don't know where he got the strength from oh [ __ ] come on it's a tiny ledge there's no way i said that's a long way it is a long way i'm kind of glad that you don't have to press the button to leg grab and they just made it easy because i i reckon i would have fallen to my death several times already i don't know if i'd drop yeah if i drop i'm just going to fall off there try going around here instead i think there's a way up here jump to this one maybe yeah there's the thundercat space over there that's where sam's chilling out [Music] there's a big patrol out there reef ah damn it watch your back sam that should hold the top oh awesome look at this waterfall i mean that looks real that actually looks that's photorealistic i didn't expect whoa where to now across i guess it yes i mean it's a simple beaker dwarves use that to drink beer i don't need to inspect to tell you that yeah we got to get out of there up and out get to the top over the cliff i wonder if that model we saw did avery actually build that oh that's uh that's the way i came in isn't it i think i thought there was a bit of a lighting bug there there's a path around there if i go around across there ah okay he's put the light on it's not reassuring that's fine isn't it take the sword you don't want the sword mate come on look at that awesome sword does that say no quarter for thieves uh is it slidy time i think it might be slightly time jesus very satisfying this is it is really satisfying ah refreshing there's crabs i knew there'd be crabs you seem shiva then that's the spyglass confirmed ah no no no no i wondered if you could dive down there have you even got prism effects on the water did you say that as i jumped up there was a little prism effect oh hey seen anyone come by here tall lanky filled with big stupid ideas for fire treasure he knows nothing i know nothing nothing are you trying to climb up there in those boots ah come on he's a pirate or she was a pirate they got to work with the boot technology of the time all right drake we can't all have steel capped climbing boots steel cap that doesn't no they wouldn't work very well would they pretty sure you don't need this oh cool i've got a pick a pit on reach towards the porous surface and press square to jab it in cool it's working i mean it is climbing simulator now yeah you have to jump and do it at the right moment so you can use it as a leverage point almost there cool yes advanced tactics right here okay it doesn't look as scary now the storm's gone but i mean it's still quite ominous isn't it oh adorable you're not going to make me drop down are you you gonna make me drop down maybe yeah okay we have to do a running jump and stick it in cool why didn't i have this the whole game i love this it's great i think i can make that one yes [ __ ] what were you firing at boy saw something maybe move went along the tree line the jungle over there eh it's all moving i don't see anything damn it all right everyone false alarm but keep an eye out i don't see anything here mate nothing to worry about okay i'm basically the predator now i'm okay with it oh it's all done wrong [Music] i just wanted to be the predator that's all i ever wanted i think we'll get an opportunity to be the predator again though it's fine [Music] oh right they've lost me yes i'm gonna jump across see that one coming i do like the fact that they flanked you keep you on your toes a bit you know it's fine dead nothing to worry about nothing to see there's more bad guys down there can i jump to that i don't think i can i could use a swing here though that could be fun it's fine it's nothing to worry about that's right we're all clear nothing to say no sign of him anything i'll take that [ __ ] oh yeah off me dude all right where is this prick you're next [Music] kobe oh snipers move nate move oh god no no that's the predecessor i didn't realize there were that many bad guys over there [Music] oh okay it's okay it's okay lights up gorilla radio okay get a bit closer where's that sniper a sniper over there somewhere i'm gonna have to jump that slide and jump yes come here big guy big guy has he's got like a combat shotgun or something what is that hello it's an assault rifle i'm gonna find you right it's time to go loud i'm afraid [Music] yes [Music] awesome combat in this game is great it's very fun m14 custom couple of grenades here at the m14 might be more useful in this jungle type environment here what's that oh the barrack yeah that's the one banger i almost forgot to press square then hey right where do we have oh there we go perfect this has to be the right way okay where to it's so beautiful so pretty what's this jonathan burns has murdered me what wow that is pretty dark dude pirates burns crew had about as much luck as me with this treasure pirates out here being pirates you know that's all i'm saying that's a dagger i wonder how many times nolan north says no in this game is there a no count i'd like to see that youtube video [Music] it's fine i nearly shut your head off saying you're okay yeah nothing i can't walk away from it's good to see you alive little brother come on we got a treasure to find hold up man i mean what are we doing what do you mean i mean our supplies are at the bottom of the indian ocean okay so we go steal some from nadine's army yeah and there's that we're going up against an army we've been holding our own so far while being marooned in the middle of nowhere we were trying to get here remember we had an escape plan just hear me out crazy suggestion let's go down there and at least secure one of rafe's boats the boats can wait you wanna know what we're doing here we are buying my life back okay and we're gonna do that by stepping into that jungle and finding libertalia have you even seen any signs of a massive pirate colony because i sure the hell haven't he's a little late to start developing doubts don't you think can we at least acknowledge the chance that maybe avery's idea for secret pirate utopia didn't pan out and maybe we're just swept up in this fantasy when instead we should be looking for a real way to save you i'm gonna scour this island inch by inch if i have to until i find that treasure now if you're confused about what you're doing here then you can go home nathan wait wait wait i can go home are you kidding me do you have any idea what i put on the line to get you here about what i put on the line okay the last 15 years of my this has nothing to do with that it has everything to do with that what holy crap [Music] you still want to go home let's just see what else we can find we're on the right track oh the lemurs are back and parrots [Music] this way i'll be dead [Music] is get in there son let's take a look sam up here coming well no one's home this place has seen better days huh yeah the roof could use some work sam this way hey this is the game cheating and loading new areas hey nathan i think there's a way through here no this way it's the tricks the developers use the high loading oh this crawl is a good workout for my quads do you want to come down perhaps that's the wrong way this place this is no straw hut yep some honest-to-god masonry in here but where'd those masons come from i mean your average ship might have some good carpenters among them and coopers but that mason feels good to stretch out again yeah you said it you keep working on those quads son hey there's a way out uh it's too high even for a boost let's uh find something to stand on i saw a box around here that we could push down there's a crate i got an idea here we go it can't be this simple all right we're in business oh maybe it is you're going to want to see this stop that nathan oh wow i recognize that screenshot [Music] it's that place he was building no houses wide street clearly a commercial district of some kind yes thank you for that nathan come on what do you see you just want to hear me say it don't you really want to hear you say it say it libertage libertalia the long-lost legendary pirate utopia discovered after 300 years by one samuel drake and and his younger slightly less charming brother oh come on for the right you know i always knew you'd make something of yourself one day yeah just so you know it's not my first lost city you should just enjoy the moment take it in so where you want to start how about that building right over there oh you mean the one with the massive guard tower yeah i say we go see what it was guarding works for me aliens ancient aliens that's what it's guarding i'm speechless holy god damn [ __ ] nathan that's your idea of speechless god how long do you think it took them to build this place years decades how the hell did they keep it a secret all that time i did i did say pirate nda didn't i hey sam check it out it's like a pirate code of conduct he who deserts libertaria in time of battle she'll be punished by death pirate ships had their own rules yikes where's captain jack locked of course you better start believing in ghost stories you're in one uh it's some g fuel in there nate down it let's go candy floss flavor that one what are you doing there hey it looks like there's a path or something through there we squeeze through that or no that's blocked off there not been down here yet captain avery he's wondering when you turn up i bet he had a really fancy ship didn't they the fans just ship on the sea uh i don't like the jingle jangles oh they got armor in here check out this it's a forgery i made spears there's even a pirate utopia needs a place to lock up riffraff can you imagine who pirates put in prison well i guess every group has its [ __ ] that's true dead end nope no way to go there what's this symbol i saw a few of them when i was coming to find you who's marking these places is that another sigil no not that i know of maybe invaders i mean i'm sure these guys had plenty of enemies out there good point hey nathan check it out what chop off the head i would totally get a picture of myself in this thing if we had a camera that is well hey i can sketch in my journal really yeah i've got to see this nice drawings nate i love that one that's good very good that's back in the jail now i was climbing up there because i think that might be the way through a musical instrument this was a nice little utopia that avery was building hey look at this there were families here yeah so where the hell did everyone go i mean are they all raptured or something for the bobby you not jump up there now no he doesn't want to go up there this is amazing and all but how do you suppose we get to that big building with the tower uh oh it's that underground route from earlier we looked at it from repair didn't we this way follow me oh careful hey sam come here this looks promising right behind you hey guess we're not going back that way it's like a hideout of some kind what would they be hiding out from themselves look at this looks like the layout of the commercial district boom there's our treasury right there see there's the tower what were these guys up to the mystery before our very eyes i'll shine it in your face time i don't even care look yeah that's right yeah yeah you like that there's that symbol again yeah stop repeating me sam you know if that symbol was from an invading force we wouldn't have found it in an underground hideout maybe there was trouble in paradise secret society or rebels all definite possibilities i just like shining the light in his face that's blocked oh there's a treasure there ah get me some pirate treasure well you can't get it from there can you i must have missed something there's a ladder cheeky didn't see that the first time treasures around there i think yeah fallen angel nope don't like that that's our way out here i see some light down below how long is this rope oh we stopped there oh my god i pressed x to jump up and it just dropped off the rope yeah you can tell that this is a big level because it it does that loading thing when you die i suppose we could have dropped down a bit further but it wasn't letting me yeah now that one was close oh this looks like an awesome combat area check this out keep your head down hey how'd you do that i have to pay respects come on mark all these boys i mean i could snipe them quite easily [Music] hey it's me mario it's not mario it's it's nothing great what was that noise nothing to say damn it smash him dropping in on me like batman who do you think you are oh [ __ ] nope oh they've not done that before that's interesting what was the shotgun guy right there [Music] i did not see that chap i think maybe we should try and do this whole thing stealthy it was going okay it was a whole city man a rabbit up here why would why would a rabbit be up here how's it you got anything it's gone whatever it was it's just a big rabbit it's okay let me go around this way see i'm not sure in these combat bits can you do you have to fight people or can you just stealth it and get where you need to go without being seen you can hear some i thought there was a ledge underneath you know what we going loud i wasn't built for stealth i was built for war oh that's not good still [ __ ] [Music] there's nothing to be seen come out now they just can't hear it i'm right there drop down drop a down donkey day are you going buddy what are you what's no come back no nathan please oh you have to get his helmet off that's cool [Music] superman let's go wait what was that noise is that a box it's just a box it's a box that moves or it could be a rabbit it could have been a it was a rabbit all right hang on i got another one you've jumped past him there hey i mean that's not what i intended i think there's one more guy up here and that might be where did he go he just dropped down somewhere i can hear him [Music] no there's one guy left here somewhere sam where did he go he was right there i don't know where he's gone i can't find him [Music] hit the high ground we might be able to see him he's looking up there why are you looking up there some is that where the guy is shoreline all right boys it's sniping time head shot oh you didn't like that did you get the helmet off boom thank you alley-oop you see any more are we clear i think we're clear we're good all right yeah just a little winded oh franklin forgive me i dared not speak of this in the presences of our families last night i did not want to distress them i've not seen my cousin jack that's me where i'm right here like that's that's where i'm at yeah well matthew i'm i'm right here so come find me if you want me i'm not going anywhere ah where to dropped down here didn't we must be that way monkey come bars sam is that thing steady it's fine there's anything else around here oh okay so no all right all right here i come everything breaks sam you should know this by now i'm the unluckiest man on the planet yes aina this whole place is falling apart it's an old building over the edge hey you ever done anything like this villages we need to get up a bit higher let's go oh he's right there oh god that's it come to papa come to papa okay say good night sweet prince i am vengeance i am the knight in that grenade [Music] schwing can we swing on that oh i don't know it might be a bit too far away hey i'm glad that was there oh this guy's having a great time look at him too late mate what do you want what was that noise old snap of the neck i think this is the right way are you gonna grab on to something if i jump here [Music] i don't know get out the way sam get out of the way maybe that was the right way that's a good climb that there just drops off let's go back up how did the soldiers get here one extreme i ask myself that question all the time oh it's just down here isn't it i think they must have helicopters and they just follow me around that's it they get dropped in okay thanks whoa jeez making progress [ __ ] that's not progress but we can go around maybe that's where we're headed to that giant building there that's it but now better keep moving i want my piton back please i enjoyed that and i go batoning again ladders busted in the middle we'll make do keep heading up you know the only time i've seen nate eat anything was right at the start of the game how you doing back there how old are you he must be starving it does pound g fuels like no one's business though so that's how he gets the energy might have a jump across here there's a ladder we can use beautiful up we go i'm guessing it's that ledge there yeah we got it oh man yeah i don't believe they built this place and no one knew about it i've got interiors and everything covered in mud now as well okay now what trust me follow my lead okay aim for the parrots do all of that then yeah something like that you've already done half of it he survives off gamer girl bathwater i don't think it's that jury we're definitely in the high rent district now not residential though i think some kind of administration building it's nice probably maybe libertalia had a zoning committee maybe they paid taxes who knows pirates don't pay taxes come on you should know that no way through up here either but there's treasure it's a small perfume pot look at these materials this must have taken years and years now it's great piles of money comes no responsibility of course not what they say yeah well money can't buy taste too slippery we've got to get up around there i think this is a realistic depiction of what civilization would look like if nature took over it feels real to me that door was locked though wasn't it snowy up and over try up here well that's a symbol isn't it i can't jump up there where do we go some no we can rope here is there ah wow the only place i haven't looked really is over here i thought this is the way we came in there's another sword do you not want to take that come on surely oh wow this reminds me of gears of war [Applause] holy crap and there was a battle here some of them anyway jesus something went down cannons improvised barricades what the hell happened here some kind of battle it's a rhetorical question real question is who's fighting who why it's a diorama of war some of the bodies are older though man this is impressive uh to say the least there's no way that's open here we go hey he's lost his head it's empty where's it gone of course it is anything rafe no nothing's been touched in here for hundreds of years right well search for clues yeah search for clues count to 15. the thieves of libertarian some kind of a revolt happened obviously thief avery was the thief this whole time he's depicted himself as an honorable man maybe that wasn't the case oh my god is that no fancy clothes got a uniform you were a guard here weren't you nice job i have a feeling we're going to find the skeleton of avery here somewhere look at that painting that's worth millions nowadays good question what if maybe there's no treasure left you know they spin it all on marble floors so the colonists find out their money's gone and they get pissed and maybe so and bonnie didn't have thief written on her painting the rest did what's this old manifest lots of treasure they're giving it for war was there anything on the back i don't think you can flip that one get on top of these bookcases i don't suppose i could climb this oh no i thought maybe i could that's his head isn't it captain avery yeah i've certainly seen better days well he's ruined i mean his head's head's come off it's a nice chandelier another thief what happened here hey nathan check it out what what you got the battalion money says avery sigil must have melted down the gold minted his own currency so based on that all the manifests on the shelves the treasure was here yeah leaves the bigger question where is it now okay so we know that there was fighting outside yeah dan inside you think the colonists stole it no i think they were trying to reclaim what was theirs look there's avery two founders are libertarian all marked with the word thief not murderer not tyrant thief so by the time the colonists busted in here treasure was already gone yeah because these guys had already taken it for themselves pirates will be pirates right pirates will be pirates huh i know where they moved it where what where oh look at that that's a map yeah right there that's our treasury it's a map of liver time all right so follow it to the other side of the island look right there new devon [Music] avery was from devon england he sure was man those are some seriously large mansions each of them has its own sigil too because that's where they lived you say we uh climbed that watchtower huh get our bearings new devin here we come new devon you know i've never been to devon in real life i have no idea what it's like how do we get up there well i didn't see a way earlier unless i can climb that is that treasure there yeah maybe you can climb these i just did it a bit too early you give me a hair with this okay what are we gonna do with this okay ready okay that's step one step two yeah i jumped the gun didn't know the chandelier good idea just take the compliment all right now the place is looking classy let's get up there rope's not going to reach it from down here so you just have to go in the bookcase okay oh nice one tarzan paws on it's an insult this one i'll do it i think because it's swinging over there yeah see hers doesn't have thief on it i reckon i can just swing straight over there now maybe grab it let's go a little bit lower sorry content baldrige what you're stepping on baldrige no so i am they're not gonna highlight i mean i wouldn't i wonder why maybe it's just ripped off it's deadly apparently that's not the right way to go [Music] this is the right way to go i've got to get up this tower here now you're done hey then all right up we go i'm sure there'll be a staircase at some point that isn't intact jinx us like i said all right nathan you seen this tower sure am what the dome [Music] can't quite reach that yet feature now [Music] the rope physics is so good now very good sam yeah all right just making sure you haven't plummeted to your death sure is excited need to lift go on get lift come on ready ready all right i found something stand back here i mean that's the treasure box isn't it should we not look in that probably millions of dollars worth of treasure in there or something there it is thundercats quite the crow's nest huh there it is just on the other side of the river now what do you say we go rob from the rich huh give to the poor hey is there a path down there uh of sorts what that's precarious isn't it how long do you think it'll take us it looks awesome yeah a couple hours depends on what or who we bump into along the way excuse me i wasn't expecting rpg either rpg the first time that they've done that you're all right yeah come on it's popping up i can't drop or anything don't let me drop down then [Music] you all right the character model said that while he was dead [ __ ] night rpt [ __ ] jesus what am i doing wrong here isn't it obviously you just dropped down there you all right jesus blowing [ __ ] up don't think down here there we go where are you controls don't make it obvious sometimes jesus something tells me they've had enough of us really what gives you that idea down here quick don't wait just go i think it's the rpg stuff i think that's what it is ah oh oh my god the building is falling thanks oh this is nuts keep running don't stop gotta go okay oh sam no not more we are oh everything is falling apart i mean that was a bit intense wasn't it all right let's try this again life just keeps kicking you back down and then you die okay solid ground i'm a big fan of that i just missed my pit on so much it was so good oh no not nadine where did she come from hey nadine great to see you guys okay mango mango what are you on about mango oh that's my safe work all right oh you're always that's clever i have my moments yes you and your brother have proven yourselves the more capable treasure hunters on the island shame we're not on the same side still time trusted drake i'm not falling for that again good job she's actually crazy okay that was a bit rougher than expected i'll just uh leave so far just leave after everything you think i'm just going to let you walk away that'd be the wise thing to do oh come on nadine really we know you're a badass and all but there's two of us [Music] i don't think my men are on their way here right now all i have to do is buy some time that's if i don't finish it myself oh i mean she's basically jane wick you know that's look at her i'm tired of silence i'm tired of your brother how do i deal with such recklessness rude it's just rude isn't it we're gonna have to do some kind of epic superman jumping punch i don't know something just gotta put a stop to this i can't get back in that way she's just killed him think i was too slow sounds dead guys sorry that's the end of the walkthrough oh my gosh popped out of the wall here we go flying sleeping on punch oh what's this oh there it is you're fast but you're not that fast hey forget about her come on we gotta get out of here before they [ __ ] everybody just just calm down okay well this is interesting nate samuel put your guns down all of you no reef this guy's on edge oh don't worry about him nadine these guys don't kill anyone in cold blood it's just not their style you wanted to bet her life on that go ahead then shoot her sam i die you both died not another step i mean like this sam put the gun down i warned you do it hold your fire don't shoot put it down it's done okay it's done don't worry nadine it's not their style i say i didn't think he had it in him samuel you okay i guess you knew this moment was coming huh hey come on man you already got us take it easy not your business man let's just just work out a deal oh i do oh yeah love to hear what you have in mind oh you can go ahead i'm listening i just you want to find avery's treasure we'll help you find it in exchange i let you live yeah that and a small cut the gauchos on this guy just enough to get him his freedom okay his freedom nathan yeah he did hard time our time and the guy who broke him out hector alcazar he owes him a lot of money whoa what the hell are you talking about nate hector alcazar died in a shootout in argentina like six months ago what i'm the one that got samuel out he lied oh no wow what did he tell you [Music] sam what kind of story did you cook up alcazar really you lied you lied to your baby brother we're wasting time just a second thing is nate i never stopped looking for avery's treasure i just kept running into these dead ends and then i hear that our dear old samuel drake an authority on avery is alive and somewhat well there was no breakout i bribed the prison warden and your brother he just waltzed right out the front gate he spent the last two years tracking down the second saint dismiss cross you know what he did it all with me oh okay that's [ __ ] oh sam care to refute nate awesome she's snowed oh listen avery's treasure was out it was always ours i left my life for you [Music] hey look look nate if it's any consolation he duped me too he pulled the houdini on me he brought you and that old man back into the mix and i cannot lie sam that really pissed me off but well behind us now you don't deserve it you do last i checked we're all a bunch of thieves digging around where we shouldn't raise what one way or another end it or i will well you heard the lady hey you missed one clue and you can kiss that treasure goodbye said it yourself keep running into dead ends why don't you face it ray if you need us [Music] no you're right you're half right no i just need sam wait now you're making a mistake [Music] oh my god nate hey nate dude sam got shot look like it hit his shoulder ah there it is the hell lives here anyway uh no idea but this is definitely the address been scoping the place out for the past few days no one's home and here we are this place is humongous where do we even start we'll start by finding our way in and then we can take the grand tour i wasn't sure when we were gonna head back here because right at the start of the game they do a flashback do you think this place has an alarm let's try and find a way in it is the front door [Music] it open worth a try i thought they'd come back to this point a bit earlier than they did but i assume this will be a stealth mission that's going to be locked as well isn't it okay give me your hand yeah i'm not big nathan drake anymore i need help all right there you go i can't jump that high oh this sucks follow me it's weird it's just taken away my ability to jump i hate it why is that window open why would you go away and leave a giant window like that open whoa spooky well here i brought a spray spoopy so are we looking for any particular room and just keep an eye out for any books journals any kind of research papers you know nothing in here it's a box i don't know what sam wants from this nope what's he looking for the boxes are filled with old traveling and camping equipment oh check that out [Music] what you got sam way down there we go i said it so how do we find them want mom's notebooks i mean don't you remember she always used that off-white leather binding yeah i know but it's such a large place here we go white leather sam i think i found one for real yeah no it's not one of mom's you have the right idea though let's keep looking so it'll look like that this is a big place the rooms that they've created in these interiors are so realistic they're some of the best looking realistic interiors in video games maybe the best it's just the sheer amount of detail and it's so intricate you don't usually get that was this your house hey these boxes remind you of anything every place we ever lived exactly i remember dad was always like why bother unpacking we're just gonna move again in a month yep always the [ __ ] that's where we came in once you game a pool or foosball hey sam me crazy but this looks like a ming dynasty vase nathan who in the right mind would have a ming dynasty vase just sitting around like that oh budge here let's do it together you ready what is that that's putin car moon is it it's some sort of sarcophagus yeah look around this whole place she's filled with sarcophagus or sarcophagi plural sam this is real what is this place well let's go find out so many secrets

go sup to shima uh hollyhock leaves are um let's see don't tell me don't tell me uh tokugawa clan yeah right you are surely that's really heavy too big for a kid oh you were gonna burn this one well you burnt half of it is that a letter that means it's important left of it someone wanted to buy their stuff i guess they said no not like they needed the money i wouldn't want to part with the stuff either can you imagine being the one to actually uncover these things must be something right oh it's an old gramophone nice liven up the place since when do you like classical music excuse me i am a man of many tastes are you mom's stuff might be in one of these rooms we gotta find another way in can we go out the window nope oh you want to go back down there'll be another route here somewhere

looks really expensive oh my god the game knew didn't it it knew i just knew i don't want to break this one either nathan don't break it please climb the wheel that will do now this is some kind of mad secret room in here surely there i'll see you on the other side okay it's a good thing i'm not claustrophobic he's like a little spider-man isn't he why is it gold as well you need interior gold air vents is that necessary well it's like a hospital in here my son was sick i'm in can you get the door open locked ah it's locked from this side too yeah codeine is an opiate can really mess you up there's a photo here there's the k got it it's a nice looking key old school anything didn't see any journals all right well we still got the other lock door so come on is the key going to work yeah

our mom's your cassandra morgan's boys uh hi my god i could have sought you yeah yes you still might so uh do you mind you knew our mom she worked for me as i'm sure you've noticed i'm a collector of sorts that's sort of an understatement so mom was like your translator your mother was the most brilliant historian i have ever met we could have accomplished so much together but then her illness i'm sorry no it's all right happened a long time ago of all her discoveries this would have been her crowning achievement greatness from small beginnings so francis drake's motto yeah latin and historical figures those were our dinner conversations we were a weird family did she ever tell you her theories regarding sir francis drake and his heirs sir francis drake didn't have any ears that's what history tells us but your mother and i believed otherwise [Music] learning that old pirate secrets is just one more adventure i have to let go i guess there's a lot i have to let go forgive me
