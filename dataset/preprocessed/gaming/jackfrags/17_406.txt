hi guys hope you're all doing well today we're back on battlefield 5 playing on rotterdam a map which i hadn't touched in a while as i played it way too much when the bf5 beta was out but this match turned out amazing mainly because i decided to switch it up to a sniper class using the enfield i won't spoil it too much but there were a lot of headshots in here it was a fun game to play now a big thanks to rock app for sponsoring today's video they sent over some of their new gaming peripherals for me to try out the elo air wireless headset first pro mouse sense amo mousepad and the tkl pro keyboard i'll be using all of this stuff in the gameplay today the headset features 7.1 surround sound with 50 millimeter speaker drivers and promises a 24 hour battery life with a removable noise cancelling microphone the burst pro mouse is lightweight at 70 grams and can push 16 000 dpi if you want that option as for the mouse mat well i've never had a customizable rgb one before but there you go such things are available nowadays out of everything they sent over though my favorite is definitely the tkl pro keyboard tkl stands for 10 keyless and it means that there's no numpad the theory being that you get a compact keyboard more room for your mouse movements if you use a low sensitivity in fps games like i do and you can just focus on the important keys it also has linear optical switches and is low profile and since using it it has become my main gaming keyboard and if you're interested in checking out any of these rocket peripherals there's a link down in the description below that you can click on with that said let's get into the game enjoy i haven't played rotterdam for ages it's been a while and i wanted to get the head shot but i also wanted to use the scg today keep it classic i've got that nice mint finish on there get off that point mate oh he's dead right let's see where this game takes us then that white house is actually based off a real building as if that here i just thought i'd go for it let's just clap someone in the face there it's based off a real building called the it's called the white house but i think it's dutch and it's like vitter house something like that you know my pronunciation is terrible in the window lovely but i've seen some like in-game screenshots and real-life screenshots and it looks like dice did a fantastic job getting the lightness of it right ow so i'm jumping more because i've been playing too much uh wall zone you can jump and shoot in this game but it's nowhere near as effective as it is in cod stg just shoots true though man it's really really strong it's probably my favorite gun in bf5 to be honest took a while i feel like out of all the guns in the game the stg was the one that the gun designers spent the most time on here again such a good spot doing it i don't know just the way it feels well at least we've got one wasn't it one of the only guns in the alpha two it wasn't that many it's like that though like it's yeah obviously i took a lot of shots to kill that guy but the recall i don't know it's just something about it's nice and predictable you can feel it you know where it's going yeah i remember it dominating the alpha but the ttk was different then like some people prefer what the ttk was like in the alpha you know i'm going to change up to an enfield just fancy doing some sniping looking at the map i might have a good opportunity here i'll do a bit of snipers there's the first headshot i love that look at them all running around in there like rats it's like the okay corral stand still hey we got him all i want is for one of them to stand still he tried closing the door it's adorable the vehicle over here i love this site though oh that tank is not having a good time so far this video oh my god there's so many it's just been me trying to take this white house hasn't it steve stop sliding around ow what oh hit the box pick me pick me yes got him no we're attacking this could be spicy because there might be a load here it's the only point they've got missed the drag shot there just goes prone i love this yes oh no i missed the second drag shot as well oh rest straight away aod snipers thank you on aod like a big um a big battlefield clan like they've got a huge community or something right all the way back to bf3 and bf4 and i know i've said this like a thousand times but that's sniping in this game oh this game in bf1 amazing it's even pretty uh satisfying console too and i'm terrible on the controller but you know how recently i've played a lot of xbox battlefield v so different but i've even tried a bit of sniping on it too and it's uh missed the gunner it's really good fun i actually bound the key for slide as well again just because i slide in all the time in warzone and i never really used the slide function in battlefield 5 but you can find a separate key to it so i've just got it on mouse 4. so if i'm in trouble and i need to get in color there's more here i just double tap that button and slide away so another one there i'm getting a bit too oh god that's about to say i'm getting a bit too pushed out here bit too confident i'm gonna get killed i've got throwing knives here too as well i don't know why i've got that in my class anyone down here still dropping back to be dropping back to b these guys sound cool put that little ap mine down there's people on the point cheeky little guy here went for a nice little sniper spot there oh same spot different guy yeah we've got a but they've gone behind us to get b bloody white house i'll be careful here i thought there might be an angle there sniper in the back yes come on medic feels bad man feels bad i think my character actually started counting the head shots then too ow that's mean i'm dead swings and roundabouts on radham isn't it i feel like i've been in this situation so many times on this map though where axis just have the control and it's just a and b for the uk team i wonder if there's you know some kind of the balance issue with the map or do i just have a good team here but yeah i just i swear this has happened like so many times on rotterdam maybe it's just uh imbalanced towards the germans long reload in it gone inside the shop could hate that one you pick it again there's been a lot of headshots this game hasn't there there's been a lot all the way at the back ah i wanted that one oh my god a tank right i'm going bye there's 70 kills [Music] yes hello oh got him this one watering us like what's going on here artillery style okay it's getting crazy it's prone with the type 2a cool right that's all she wrote gg those guys were actually using voice comms as well oh thanks cute i don't think i've got it bound so i
