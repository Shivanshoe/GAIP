this is one of the funniest games of war zone that i've ever played very fun this one and we ended up with a really high kill count and there was just a lot of great moments i wanted to share with you guys i jumped on this morning 10 a.m uk time don't usually play that early in the morning but if you want to have fun on warzone you're going to play early in the day so it's just a solo match and i dropped boneyard here that dude nearly wasted me he almost got me to be fair and i never dropped boneyard in two hours or quad so i thought you know what let's do it could be quite fun typically i don't come here though because it's so messy but i found myself a heartbeat sensor that was just unlucky for that dude i've got the ffa part my loadout as well it really is just the best assault rifle in the game right now in my opinion really far i think it even beats a mach 10 up close but here i was being hunted changed the double threat so i knew this dude was around and luckily i still got a heartbeat center so just throw it up here get the direction over here somewhere listen up the footsteps and get the kill avoid that bounty now it was at this point that i thought you know what i'm just going to full send this match first game of the day let's do it so hopped in the tack rover over to the bike check the building nothing there get that load up straight away and we're going to buy a uav pop the uav and i'm just looking for fights now i just want as many kills as i possibly can i think that dude was running over to the buy they've got a ton of cash there ready to get the load out but it ran into me unfortunately it's already over here on their own not much cover here is there unlikely they're going to have their loadout and i just went for it [Music] with the squirrel now watch this just trying to get the finish launch this guy into oblivion he went flying in the air there sent that dude to the shadow realm got a button at the uab spotted this one over here in boneyard again dropped out my tracking was a bit off there we did get the kill eventually going around just making enough cash as i can making sure i'm always topped open to be fair it's quite early in the game here and i'm looking at 17 000 almost upgraded to the truck picked up a bounty on the way two dudes over here having a little fight i was just feeling it but i was just feeling a bit bit sassy i don't know spotted the guy on the roof he's gonna know that i'm there but again just chanced it got stuck on the roof there crouching not to make any noise he was still looking at the truck for some reason even though jumped out and i thought that was the bounty but it wasn't but there's obviously a dude underneath me with the bounty as i get shot at from the side there jumping off the roof but oh just i'm being an absolute menace here just double check that roof in case only one place i can be heard the door wasted right man as soon as you get those ffa headshots just going down it's not a bit of a roll here really and my strategy in solos has always been attack people get uavs get as many as possible and some dude precision air strikes me there from the top of the train station but i managed to save the truck just can't play solos where you're just sitting there building i can't do it my brain just starts to melt so i always have to be on the move and looking for people to kill checking the heartbeat here and i had a feeling there was someone around we got recovered as luck would have it right there and that guy could have easily killed me but i had to punish them because their name is better than you and as we all know it should be better than you that's grammatically correct so i think that's definitely why i won that battle we're driving around some more there's a load out here got the notification someone was dropping in and that dude just stood there and took it like a boss i think they knew that the end was near fresh out the gulag spotted another one on the uav and i've got that dead silence so of course i'm going to push in there peek the door slowly open it so it doesn't make a big noise the guy's in here still catch him running in there and i was considering do i wait for them to come out let's attack use that dead silence to full advantage stupid debate whether it should be in the game though some people like it some people just think it's too rng but it's there you're gonna use it on you now this is something that i see often in solo matches one truck followed by another truck the trucks give you a lot of protection obviously hard to hit the driver inside but i swooped down got my ghost load out and look check out the mini map another truck i didn't want to really give myself away i could i've picked up the strela there and gone for the kill but just trying to remain incognito requesting recon pushed over to boneyard uav entering the air zone's heading over this way and if you look at the mini map there's a dude hiding in that raised up airplane just around the corner here it's not a very good spot to hide to be honest because you just pigeonhole yourself in there i didn't want to waste my new daddy just wait for the perfect shot there it is nailed them truck pulls up behind though i'm not sure what this truck is doing i'm looking for an angle so i know there's not much room in there so i was like what the hell's this dude doing and that is as easy as the kill you'll ever get i think that we're just stuck there trying to get the truck out and then i jumped in because i was like i want a truck and then i quickly learned their predicament it's a bit it's a bit tight in there unfortunately i don't notice they respect me so pop the horn jump out i'll give the old thumbs up in a second here oh lords thanks for the truck well i got it out oh yes zone is pushing in this guy's 100 on his own here again just feeling feisty feeling confident my truck is 45 50 health so i'm going to go for this one for some reason just tried to take me out shouldn't just hit behind a tree but the disrespect with the squealer oh good i should change that horn one day but it's too funny way too funny at the moment tried to get back in the truck and got beamed in the back by an ffa are as i'm jumping in redeployment ruined but we got to the gulag just before it closed and there was no one to fight got released after a minute dropped back in a free load out here it's very lucky that it landed on the roof there because it's quite easy to get hold of only six other players in the match and you know even though there's not a heartbeat here i'm still being careful and that's why if they were peeking the door when i came in lady killed me because i was looking to the right but maybe they just turned away for a second and just turned back when i opened the door i came on top there got some loot back got myself the satchel but i've got a bit of a nasty push here towards the final remaining zones not much cover to get across the road i'm using a gas station and i thought there'll be someone running out of storage that later the game people always love to count their solos so many little holes you can hide in just checking the windows because i thought someone's going to be looking at me aren't they fight going on over there with a couple of vehicles and i just went for it it's my chance to go bit of a distraction if there's anyone in the building they're more than likely going to be looking over towards the vehicles anyway i made it to the wall and i'm just looking to put lots of cover between myself and the big building check the office there sometimes people camping there creeping around i didn't expect to see someone there because that's not a great position really if you look at the zone there's just no cover out there so not sure how that dude ended up in a position like that but sometimes it does just happen like that you find yourself in a bad position and two of the players left they're gonna know that i'm here but i've got to go in the building saw that dude out the corner of my eye as i came around and i knew that they were expecting me because they heard me just kill the dude out in the field with the dmr last guy left now didn't expect to see anyone on the heartbeat center there either because i'd already checked it but maybe they were just out of range pop the dead silence we're going to full send this keep looking at it just in case they move and i thought they'd be right there they weren't obviously on the roof so i stayed low circle bounced luckily for me it didn't go west if it had gone west i think i was ruined but it went north so that's fine being quiet looking for the dude i know they're above me still keep tabs on them we're gonna peek and there it is that's all she wrote got the win that was a really fun game and enjoyed it i should play more solos i really like doing them and every time i post a solo video you guys tell me how much
