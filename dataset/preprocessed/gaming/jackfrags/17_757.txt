absolutely no get the hell out there I think showdown is all the exercise I need which rifle is that you using but early 71 with the bayonet I would take a Mosin over it but I haven't got any money at the moment so it's just one that I had oh no jack you've made the big life angry like to annoy de for being blood a hot name here mother put him down yes look I thought that was a zombie that's just a man that's been hugged with no head roughly oh it's horrible no he's dead Randhir and he's burnt to a crisp so bad death eyes well I think we've done very well there I think we've both excelled in our respective fields but stinky cold well Lister die another day right so I've got my friend John on board now and you may have seen him in a couple of other videos before but he's not really played hunt showdown maybe like once before and I think that we just died straight away so it wasn't good but I've got me back on now and he's playing with me and Adam and hopefully we can get a decent game now I've got this heavy knife thing it's in mad look at this alright I'm not so good when you miss that's quite good though Adam if you use that sticky bomb on the boss since the latest patch it does like 75% damage that's pretty good but just make sure you don't miss hello you get him right in his heart is he stuck there oh yes all right [Music] I'm not fine there where some of the stairs at the back I got that dog is a dog he does a swipe Johnny as well say that can actually damage you best thing to do is keep an eye out on zombies try and keep an eye where they roughly after they move chances are they've gone after someone but they'll generally Potter around but if they start hooning away because they found someone behind us to the southwest close yep how many hey Bri leave to Jack mr. Jack oh we could just run south for the extract if you want or do you want to fight oh we should fight them let's have some spice about our lives gonna see a frame of a human being and then die the other boss has been done we want to go to it oh they're fine right there there they are see em I see him already just extract who is not like them you wanna go mind oh no war is right here somewhere there's a guy here watch your back watch back you down him yeah well I gave him something good like me to give a to were there down one was the other one in the same spot him my sights gone now but yeah I say army tagged down good job what's that I guess the route army behind me where we came from you said out of sight no Johnny of you yeah by me enough where we came from like I think he means up 34 meters of a sparks he might got to revive me around a wall where I'm mark Jack yeah I've got a sniper city careful wasted in front of me here yeah right here okay round these comput Ruiz I'll keep cranking right [Music] down stuff that you reckon it's right to start looting so they're gonna pick up the other bounty let me sleep in your arms I know I said something else that night I thought he said something very different term of service warning all right now if we look at the map let's see what they're doing they just go into the extract I think yeah it looks like it we still had a lovely time yeah it's good fine well that's two successful runs I think we can be proud of this who would like some bees you violet hey I just hit level 100 little voila [Music] [Music] you [Music]
