hi everyone hope you're doing well today I've got a really intense solo much of Cod war zone for you it's probably the best solo match that I've ever played I reckon and I managed to get the highest number of eliminations that I've ever got in a solo game my new personal best here's the loadout that I was using and I would say that this is my new favorite go-to for solos and trios in particular we've got the overkill perk selected so you can take two guns I've got the CI 56 otherwise known as the gal and as you can see this is how I've got that bad boy built on there and then also the secondary is the fennec otherwise known as the vector and I have changed this slightly based on my original recommendation I think this build in particular is way better for those close-range engagements and it just melts people so look forward to that I promise there's a ton of great intense firefights in here and also we'll be taking a look at a brand new Easter egg that's been discovered in the game at the end of the match if you guys like this leave a like and subscribe if you want to see more enjoy ah well I was gonna go for that scab but that dude's already there so I see if I can get a gun instead of shotgun horrible hate that thing grams right there stick with that I'm sure that I just heard someone here now there I missed hit the Box my lock I only hit me once up there maybe Josh the warden Phil mk2 barely ever use that by myself a nice little mp5 here though sniper but I want to go for that with the Recon there I just saw someone oh he's firing back okay didn't expect that kind of push I've been trying to use the mount a bit more toast is there anyone else I don't think so alright now you mark him like that you do get a little live track on them for a few seconds he was coming this way I think I hear him someone else as well now going pro like that doesn't really work in war zone from my experience someone else is here I think a lot of cod players still do that because it what's that oh that's the gala I'm gonna take it a lot of cod players still do that because it does work quite well in multiplayer but because in warzone you've got much longer time to kill I think it just makes you an easier target you need to get Shah Bano is one of those places though anywhere that can just happen he was just running towards me in a straight line and this is the one else just gotta go over there chops easy that is not a bad start all right there it's a pretty decent start get out load up get the self raised is this a good place to put it I reckon maybe back here because I've got the war get that gal Oh typical okay I'm just been absolutely ruined I'm not really doing anything they're closer teachers have ruined me did I just kill him I think the trike just build in and beyond the grave right that's funny I'm good about that load out then I didn't pick it up so that's his body here but there's all the loot yeah they strike actually got him there's a better look on my side today I think all right the vector just melts people man I think it's as good as an mp5 there maybe even a little bit better all right get their signs back pop the UAV right okay we've got someone else over in the boneyard keep this with the gunnel I thought that was the semtex are they coming this way yeah they all right yeah good night stills not mess around as it by Athol fire sale what should I get self res I'm gonna get three UAVs just cause they're so cheap one more I'll hold anything else let's have a look one more person in boneyard another one to the north I'm gonna go see how I can get these dudes he's in here I'm gonna pop that sign let's just in case wasn't even looking at me that one was pretty easy I think the dude that's hunting me is over here cuz I just went double threat oh that was a nice fight Earthman that was good well okay then the Recon is in the fire station but I don't know if you guys have played many solos people love to camp in the fire station so I'm dubious about going in here but I kind of won it no one is so far but I didn't check the tower and I haven't heard any footsteps maybe this was a fire station that just didn't have any one influence putting it across here circles on the way I'm gonna move a little bit are there in truck at the fire station it's too far for c4 no chance I'd stop and power in so why did they jump out then that was weird I shouldn't just kept going I am really glad though that they put vehicles back in solos cuz after the patch earlier this week they just took all the vehicles out solo so I didn't really understand why they were they did that because vehicles are a great way in solos to get around and create action create little bubbles moments just do it over there beat too far away at the moment I'm gonna try to close the gap here self res I need to get a new angle here don't think there's anyone behind me are you up there they didn't change position there should have changed or maybe ran up the hill somewhat we've a cluster strike going on down there I don't think it's worth shooting that dude well there is one on the right there see mounting is so good I just completely neglected it before when you've got a weapon built like this you mount up just makes it so easy to drop people at those kind of ranges I'm just gonna stick on the edge here because I feel like this slide isn't clear I've got a big gap to cross now I feel like I should try and get this load out because I'm still on my overkill loadout which means if anyone's got a UAV or a heartbeat sensor I'm gonna be lit up like a Christmas tree it's already Jude I think we're clear should I yeah I'm doing it go get my weapons back thank you very much right yeah we're just gonna move around and there's a dead silence there I think I might need that thank you well there's not many left but I'm gonna play this really passive because I want to try and win this one there's two people left and I've got two people watching me the pressure is on but I've not heard a peep from anyone in the last minute or so I'm guessing there's someone in that building there and I reckon there's also someone down there there's one maybe there's no one else on that side what have an angle there there you go [Music] that's good for me guys dead 1v1 think he's just on the other side the building here yes get in but that was a lot easier at the end and I thought it might be well the ex had just toasted absolutely toasted in that game and the gallon is low for those long-range shots that was really good fun that's a great game I mean it's bit hectic at the start slowed things down as it went on 18 kills I think that's actually my highest ever kill record for solo match I'm pleased with that one anyways I hope you guys like that that was really really good now I did mention an easter egg earlier on the new map trench if you look around you can find little numbers and symbols on the wall the first one that you'll need to find is right here and this will be different for you my first number was number 3 and then over here by the bunker the next number is number 4 and then you come over to the box here take a quick look inside number 1 next number is on the brickwork here number 2 and then finally under the plank of wood here number 7 is the final number head over to the bunker and input that code so for me it was 3 4 1 2 7 if you do it correctly the bunker here will open up and you can go inside and take a look and the easiest way to do this Easter Egg is just play a custom match trench and you might want to put the health up as well and I'll show you why in a second you come downstairs into the bunker and there's a table with teddy bear Captain Price there smoking a cigar and friends or pushing around toys on some kind of strategic battle plan very cute there is another aspect of this though if you look on the phone you'll see five three one two five that code is the same for everyone as far as I know so come back outside shoot that on the keypad five three on c5 go back downstairs you'll hear a phone ringing answer the phone and look behind you what's inside it's a teddy bear juggernaut with your mini guns you better watch out they're covered in armor places well for some reason and then it just self destructs and the elevator doors closed and that's that you just killed all the teddy bears what a shame but either way I hope you guys liked that and enjoyed that solo game if you did enjoy it please leave a like it's a really great way to support my channel if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
