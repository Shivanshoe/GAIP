back to call of duty black ops cold war today we are playing on pc i'm on a new account as well separate account to my playstation and i think because of the version of the game that i've got it's given me unlocks that i didn't have on the playstation so i've got all my 10 classes here but i can also pick some of the later level guns and for some reason my account's already level 50. i don't understand if that's like a pre-order thing or a code thing whatever but i wanted to test out some of the new guns today we've got a couple new smgs that i want to try but more importantly we've got the fam ass and the qbz which i thought would be pretty interesting to try we've also got 10 codes to give away today so yesterday we did playstation today we're doing pc and xbox so we've got five pc codes and five xbox codes to give away and we're gonna have some fun it's gonna be good it's unlocked all my like i've just got loads of stuff don't get it it must be a special code or something maybe it's from the beta could be score streaks i've got all the score streaks unlocked as well the game should be out now in all regions what is that vtol escort the gun ship level 54 right so what do i have at the moment i've got the spy plane the care package and the attack chopper i want to get the chopper gunner war machine is pretty brutal as well then should we go spy plane for the third one let's do that right i don't want to play vip or search and destroy are we going to queue and get some games in thank you for coming along guys i appreciate you being here tonight i hope you all had a wonderful friday i'm looking forward to playing on pc let me tell you that funny story yesterday when i streamed on my playstation 5 i was actually playing the playstation 4 version of the game completely the honest mistake but for whatever reason when you download the game on playstation 5 it also downloads the playstation 4 version and puts that one on your home screen target dropped so that happened but i did pin a comment on the stream saying you know this happened it was an accident but when i'd finished the stream i looked and i was like oh yeah that was actually the playstation 4 version it's the playstation 4 version it looks better it's definitely native 4k sorry the playstation 5 version is definitely native 4k it's got ray tracing effects and you can play it at hertz am i throwing that but i'm gonna do a video on 120 hertz because i think it's awesome that both the new xbox and the ps5 can run 120 hertz now it's it's so cool for the console games we've had that on pc for like how many years six or seven years and it makes a massive difference to how your game looks and feels and it's not something that it's not something that you can describe you just have to see it to me it's a it's a big a jump as going from 30 to 60 fps it's a big deal so i'm gonna do a video on that tomorrow but i am releasing part two of my walkthrough tomorrow first and then we'll have a video on 120 hertz 120 fps in the evening the campaign's really short it's only about three hours long but i enjoyed it the ending's a bit weird though there are multiple choices i'm not going to spoil anything but i think it creates a couple of problems for the developers [Music] uh roughneck thank you for the 20. love the content for years you're a legend thank you so much terrible thank you for becoming a member that's kind of you this famous is uh pretty neat isn't it for some reason it's called the ffar not quick enough this is the famous yeah one of the new ones i don't know why but for whatever reason i've got a load of stuff unlocked on my account it might be the code that they gave me that pistol is nice a cosmo i'll just be dropping the codes in the chat my friend is detected i'll just be dropping them in the chat i will say though when i'm going to do it so you know artillery targeting ah they're camping all the way at the back hey ben so far this looks a lot better than beta it definitely feels way way way more polished than beta i can tell you that i've not played this version of this map before i think it's just an area of the bigger map isn't it on combined arms nice little death match map though i don't think it's quite as small as something like shipment but a small map ow these stuns are for xbox and pc oh you scared me oh no i just slid into them damn it sentry [Music] nice to be playing on pc that guy's good gotta watch out for that helicopter i must be on uab there or something hey daniel i think you need more bullets in it keep just running out of ammo i shot them many many times i've nearly got my war machine hostile attack helicopter inbound no not the attack heli yeah you burn through ammo in this although it just ripped through people at close range really fast rate of fire style out it's a nice little warmer ah do i still have it i lost see those bullets raining down from here sandwich jacob thank you for becoming a member man that's really kind of you i appreciate that did you guys watch any of the easter egg stuff today on zombies it's crazy i was watching a guy called geeky pastimes who uh solved a lot of the easter egg stuff for the porn takes one website and he was doing it with noah jay earlier on some crazy easter eggs in zombies i don't know about the main game though i'm sure there's some a jack russell yeah we got five pc codes to give away today so shock story adam the pc codes you use on battlenet and the xbox codes you use on the xbox store simple what's up male man how you doing got a few unlocks for it there let's try the qbz next uh loadout that bad boy there you do get that in the campaign at one point i could make an mp5 that looks like that that's kind of cool i don't know like are there even loadouts in this like blueprints how do i get them i'm pretty sure when i loaded the game it said that i'd unlocked a couple blueprints what is the resolution on 120 hertz darius i'm gonna guess and say that on playstation 5 and xbox series x it's 1440p and then it scales that's what i would guess just by looking at it you know the graphics don't look as good but it feels it's all about the competitive feeling of it where's ghost that's what i want hey jacob from arizona what's up ibrahim it's up to you man you like cod games do you like older style cod games because i say that that's what this most resembles what setting am i using like a mix of medium and high kiwi lad at 1440p say they might put blueprints in later salman interesting i swear like my my phone just i say things that don't sound anything like siri and it just goes did you just want something no [Music] domination so here's the qb zed capture the objective they've got some cool weapon inspect animations aren't they in this game not sure about that iron sight sensitivity feels okay though i don't know if that dude died losing a securing bravo oh how did that do not die mp5 on that's one thing that i've noticed the mp5 is clearly probably the best gun in the game i lose so many gunfights to an mp5 but i haven't leveled it up like i mean on this account it's a fresh account so i don't have any attachments for it but the meta builds will be mp5 100 the hipfire in this game smg's in general really strong milano could end up being really good as well actually we've pulled ahead we i think with this going you've got to sit back a bit though i'm missing the scope oh there's someone there that's just some smoke can i get up here so when you're crouching in this game you're almost completely inaudible hiding behind the bar so we're gonna drop two codes in the chat right now we're gonna drop one xbox code and one pc code these are call of duty black ops cold war codes first come first serve if you get one tweet me let me know that you've got it nice dude sounds so unenthusiastic about that see even from that distance the mp5 is good pouch move speed seems busted well you can slide that's the move speed it depends what gun you've got as well i'm a bit quicker with my pistol detected you dead yeah there's a care package there losing b the winds in sight maintain their momentum yeah two codes coming up in the chat is that i was trying to find it i was looking for it on the minimap just then i was like where is that it just got stuck up there can you not shoot it down i'm getting distracted i don't think i can handle another year of mp5 dominance we will take this objective losing a cod's always been favorable to smg's because of how fast they are you know and the fact that you've got really good hip fire on them so you don't need to aim to a certain degree because there were no bots to get the codes just you gotta be quick you've got to copy paste really fast i see that so many times it's just not true like loads of people i do loads of giveaways in the chat and the people that get them all the time they tweet me they're real people you don't get it i'm sorry you know there's a lot of people watching but there aren't robots scanning people's chats for codes i've got to level that mp5 up man enemy care package above oh nice that frag actually got a kill you just set me on fire i feel like this is was about to say the most obvious spot to defend objective from then you get flanked did not get the uh elimination for that weird i'm not enjoying this gun as much as the amass that i just had tile expired yeah it's not great so far it might be one that you need to level up because eventually this will come to war zone i guess because they said that in december there's going to be a load of cold war stuff in warzone so it could be that they put guns like this in does warzone have a qb z i don't think it does right losing charlie securing me enemy destroyed every time mp5 [Music] are oh typing one two three in the chat guys it's not doing anything it's just um please stop you guys are crazy sorry where did all those bullets go dice what the hell was that crosstalk was right on him i know i was stunned but that's crazy you should change weapons yeah i'll change weapons for the next game like i said this stream i want to test some of the new guns so i've got we lost bravo i mean this one's not great so far just keep getting out shot by mp5s the iron sights suck every time i go there that happens it's like three times now the numbers mason what do they mean no one knows what the numbers mean care package inbound [Music] every time ready to taking bravo that's it not that i played particularly well that game hello dealer what's up hughesy how you doing uh we did ps4 codes yesterday soggy today's just xbox and pc how do you say jay-z like that jay-z uh right we'll try one of the new smgs now that's an ump that's a bison i guess but the there's an out in this game what that's crazy what's up tacos very different to modern warfare prawns really different hey ryan what's up late uh 50 today mate 50. yeah streaming in 4k checkmate it's not really an smg map though is it hey serena what's up muhammad [Music] how was that siri i said serena stop my phone's op you want to use the arg yeah we'll try it out black yeah it's uh it's a different engine the modern warfare this engine feels a bit older at times oh let's play some games did i try the haptic feedback on ps5 yeah i did it's really good when i'd actually loaded the ps5 version it's crazy every gun feels different the pressure on the triggers is different the vibrations different it's lighter it's hot it's harder there's vibration in the middle around the edges depending on what you're doing or using it's really cool the ps5 controller is awesome not not that xbox needed a new controller or anything but the new ps5 controller feels next-gen it feels like something new team deathmatch all right so this is the ump mission clock is running i think every second kind of looks like an um it's a long range map though isn't it one it's burst fire right okay i don't want it i take it back i don't want to use a burst fire especially on this map there must be a mod for it some grenade out not sure about that why would you want a burst fire smg it's like a it's a three-round burst as well it's not like the vector or anything vector you can have a five five round burst right target dropped out oh come on he finally pushes me when the the spawns flip are you using chest cmason all the time all the time is this map saying poland is it hey michael what's up pavardi how you doing right there's quite a lot of spread of that distance on it yeah this is it's not the one that's the kill i'm going to change up i think yeah so the other one was the pp bison wasn't it or the bull frog why is it called the bull frog is that where the bullets go on the visor is that how it works enemy spy plane inbound stun grenade out use the m16 yeah we might later i want to see if you can do like a full auto version of the m16 taking the lead am i just playing around the rosie with this guy apparently all right we're gonna drop two codes in the chat right now the last cxt song requesting spy plane testing where's the audio yeah i feel like they've uh reduced the footstep sounds a bit established here the footsteps were really loud in the beta they seem like they're a lot quieter in this only that's because of the audio setting i've got up i was gonna jump over him and do 180. kind of like that little rc xd driving by like that's cute what all right let's go and then what's the frosty how you doing mike air see what you did there good effect on target hostile mail kill confirmed oh is everyone me are there people in this game enemy spy plane inbound someone around me exertion noises over here i think what if it could do with some more players a map like this [Music] [Music] package and no one finally shot there for so long as if you had another c4 run into my proximity man go on i dare you they trying to napalm strike on this level enemy attack kilo above i wonder if um going prone would work well you can sprint and go prone can you sprint an abs no there's a bit of a delay on that throwing grenade [Music] i think we're going to win it though just hostile spy plane established overhead what the hell was that movement that was weird [Music] you hate how everything is blowing up all the time well it's cod isn't it i mean that's that's what cause like everything blows up all the time is there a problem contacting servers there we go no i don't want to launch war zone [Laughter] this map is from cod modern warfare no victor they removed the jump shooting no crates you can jump shoot perfectly fine in this is there a mode similar to battlegrounds it's all i play in modern warfare what's battlegrounds i don't know what that is liam m16 in the single player you get a variant of it the it's full auto inside the alg uh no problem mark let's look in stream out there good we need battlefield vietnam i think they've already done that though new boy is there a p90 in the game i don't think so i would assault it's kind of weird that the algae is listed as a marksman rifle capture all the zones get out there and take that zone this is burst fire as well what's with all the burst fire weapons i hate buzzfyer weapons i should read the instructions shouldn't i enemy i mean that dude went down in one burst will this game be playable at 4k 120 technically yeah i mean you can play a 4k 120 on pc you're actually you can do a native 4k res at 120 fps uh you can't do that on console though it's more like a 1440p 1080p res depending on what's going on yeah it does run it does run at 120 on both consoles just not native 4k that makes sense andreas thanks for the five use the ak-4 is it ak4 in the game contact um objective zone marked you know what to do oh tfm not certainly some grenades detected there's a guy right behind that dude that's been rapid fire it must be resistance just get creamed from everywhere on this map capturing the objective oh my god that's gonna kill everyone here to the next zone our momentum's building the creek is the ak-4 oh i see yeah the creek's in again confirming female huff tile down my god dude everything is blowing up all the time grenade spam is real it's not just about how many kills you get here [Music] hdr no we're not playing with hdr on sound slow motion i don't know why i'm such high level can someone look this up is there a a pre-order code of the game or a code that you can get or a version of the game you can buy where it just puts you to level 50 straight away because i was given this code by activision it's a copy of the game on battlenet but it just looked like the ultimate edition of the game does that actually have a perk where you just get 50 levels or something so the aug was uh kind of weird uh dmr 14. let's give that a go oh i like crosswords cool look at the tank it might have done it so you can use all the weapons yeah maybe that's it maybe it's a special code or something i don't know if anyone else has got that if any of the content creators actually said hey this is the real thing that's the reason why i'm level 50 because i honestly i don't know because i played the alpha is that why is that what it is assault the dmr 14. capture give thank bliss i'll try the dmr soon i just can't turn down the tank the tank is so opaque say good night anyone gonna fire a rocket at me that tank going well i hit the snow in front of me [Applause] anyone down here i want to try and get that tank the tank is my biggest concern right now why is it hitting there that's so frustrating this dude isn't even looking at me in that tank i mean this should be an easy kill providing i don't do something stupid you can't hide that perk it just means you don't get one shot by the tank if it's a direct hit oh connor we're gonna post the next campaign video tomorrow it'll be about one or two p.m uk time tomorrow there's someone else in there see that little armor symbol that came up then you guys think it's weird that tanks are in this we're taking the zone and they're very basic but it's not really a cod thing is it typically how is that a double kill oh no i'm gonna die well we can try the dmr now you're gonna sub draco thank you i kind of wish that it had a first person view you know so i could actually see what i'm aiming at you move really slowly when you radius with that that's horrible you can't repair this thing it's not possible i think you need a sign on it really is there helicopters there is a chopper gunner yeah i think there are helicopters in dirty bomb you know fire team the new game mode that they added i think there's helicopters in that you can fly around one person flying it and then another person on the gun i saw a clip from aculite where he was playing with stone mountain and they were doing that and it was pretty crazy so slow i know you can get perks that will improve that but by default i mean look at that movement speed it's awful or dark thank you for the five again from oklahoma me and the boys are always trying to be as good as you and acolyte that's funny oh thank you for watching man i appreciate it look at this moving speed horrible in such a fast-paced game i don't really see how this gun has a place maybe with a sight on it would be better sounds good though oh where'd that come from excuse me no it's gonna get me again we'll try and take it down if i get to respawn without stinger [Music] oh god wow what did i pick up then i picked up a sniper is that just on the ground in front of me oh god tank turn round that was weird oh no no i thought i had my pistol take this zone back didn't even get to use it right we're gonna drop a couple codes in the chat now xbox and pc we have to capture that i still don't fully understand this game mode you just have to get maximum momentum i think and then you can go and win i guess i don't know a bit confusing keep up the pressure push them back it reminds you of black ops 3 the way the characters talk yeah i mean it's isn't it the same engine just an upgraded version of that engine oh black ops 3 black ops 4 engine flash them out and put them down this is the final zone i think it's kind of like operations are in retreat the day is ours dramatic music i'd like to play that map with the conquest flags look at that that's what i won i just got that in the single player smg's the only one we haven't tried is the m60 the pig and i don't imagine that being very good we'll see what's up chase you just got reconstructive arm surgery yesterday dude that's crazy i hope you recover okay i don't like that map what happened m60 piggy yeah yeah i like the music john do you think once they start to merge cold war with modern warfare they will suffer i don't know i think a lot more people will be playing warzone though hey laura what's up anderson mala taylor lewis lucas how's it going guys hey troy domination seize the objectives right i don't want that i think a shotgun is a secondary one sucker punch yeah okay whatever m6 there here it is that's big the big pig to like oh my god it bounces around like crazy [Music] [Music] i don't think the pig is going to work out on this map try and get a couple kills are we just being spawn camped into oblivion here multiple hostile spy planes detected check your fire check your fire that's the classic iron sight isn't it for the m16 you hold up we've got to watch out uh okay so i was attached to that zip line and then someone behind me got on it and it knocked me off that's cool i guess [Music] [Music] just climbed on the boat and murdered me are they still there there's a bit of revenge for you how about that how'd you like them apples oh it sounds good when you shoot two of them at the same time [Music] not like this maybe you barely get a chance to react to that [Music] dude got a shot off on me to be fair well played elijah uh okay oh it's happened again that's weird i hate that [Music] let's fire again why are there so many bus fire guns in this game i hate them i hate burst fire guns they just don't work in call of duty games i'm sure someone's got a great example of a burst fire gun that was overpowered is it 1990 again no it's still 2020 unfortunately [Music] i just want to get a nice little flank on without being shot oh shooting at me though is there just someone in the water there what the hell there's just a dude floating around in the water shooting at me yeah i'm getting melted niko yeah this is what uh predominantly pc lobbies of cod games are like uh and if you're not using meta weapons you're gonna have a bad time i'm just testing new weapons out yeah i mean obviously the m60 isn't the one for this map though especially with no upgrades on it it'll be good for sniper though this map established artillery targeting detective artillery are we losing a i don't see anyone here [Music] this isn't how we drilled it i don't know if he's faking that voice or if it's real i can't tell [Music] put that missile down oh my god that's the keenest thing i've ever seen 18 what what is with that why does that keep happening that's bugged that's so annoying i think it's when you're on the zip line and someone parachutes behind you it just knocks you off it horrible i need to fix that oh it's nice when you get a few kills though right at the end of the game when it didn't count you 18 thank you so much for the 10. i'm doing good hey team long time canadian fans since battlefield squad up always love your content you've still got the original jf t-shirt perhaps we can do some private warzone matches with subs yeah that's something we might do i've just added private games and i do have a discord server where we could easily organize some kind of event william you always you almost liked that mounting was still a thing yeah yeah i wish you could mount in this game so there's the m60 is that all the new ones now rpd was already in tried the outgoing the dmr i haven't unlocked that yet level 55 or more level cigar so i think that's all the new guns we've tried and now it's back to the mp5 we might do sniping bend it for the memes yeah audio preset treyarch mix changes to headphones i kind of wish there was more guns than that to be honest armada is a fun sniping map john i'll give it that surely some sniping may be done still no g3 a3 yeah you think with it being a cold war game you'd have a g3 a3 that'll be a dlc weapon probably you know yeah i played the story domination how fast you move when you've got it captured that's with no extra attachments as well that's from warzone isn't it a picture the mp5 is really cool on the new the s5 controller [Music] ps5 can do 120s then i tested it myself yesterday quicker as well after that would be good for grenade spam but it feels a bit clunky at times that's all maybe i should get steam as well okay that's full full aim assist there that killed me that's cool there was a guy in the tower but they just got their head blown off you kidding me throwing in the bush use the ak treads yeah we'll use a few guns tonight i've used a different gun every game so far arcade game you can play him in the single player [Music] it's like on uav then i have ghosts so i shouldn't have been maybe it's just an obvious spot yeah i've completed the campaign verse the g36c would be amazing i'll be cool your stream is helping me choose which weapons to use which ones to avoid i mean don't take this as a good example of that because i haven't unlocked any of the attachments and as you know with lots of guns in call of duty games it might be bad when they start but once you've got the attachments they're actually pretty good so you know maybe there's a version of the famas the super long range or maybe there's a version of the orb that lets you use full auto or something you know so don't just discredit them definitely need a laser on that multiple enemies i'm just getting wasted by everyone this much [Music] can't get a kill alec thank you for the 1000 crc i don't know what currency that is but thank you why do animations look two generations older but they're certainly not as refined as modern warfare i don't know if that's because of the system that they used or their engine or whatever but yeah the animations in modern warfare are definitely a lot more polished i would say what's going on i feel like maybe all of the animations in modern warfare and warzone are mocaps maybe that's it i mean they must smoke up some animations for this but a lot of them look old school right is that what you mean i get what you're saying yeah enemies just a bit more refined in uh [Music] other one hunter how are you doing this game just throws things on your screen okay you got this and that and this and that and that and not two and you got this anyone like this congratulations you got that and that and this and that and that as well and you got that and you got this new gun and you got this too and here's an ice cream that's just from one kill there must be a reason they do it a retention or satisfaction or something i don't know what monitor am i using at the moment i'm using an hp omen x27 it's 1440p 240 hertz really nice monitor very fast no input lag on it well there'll be some input lag on it technically speaking but it's imperceptible to me very very very good monitor [Music] it's expensive though but if you want 1440p and high frequency not a bad out multiple enemies by playing contacts although i've just been sent one of those asus 360 hertz monitors and i need to test that i've not had a chance to test it yet package above no idea where just exploded [Music] how's that noise is that dinosaur again from last night oh i couldn't switch fast enough i will drop another two goes at the end of this game someone asked how often stay on i just say randomly and then they appear magic enemies [Music] went about that completely the wrong way then did battlefield added dinosaur survival mode ginga stingers i really doubt that if they did then that's the best thing ever i mean maybe as a joke i've always wanted them to do a fun dinosaur mode like that just lean into all the memes uh what should we use next someone said use the ak i'll do that iron curtain look at that oh so that's a code bonus or something black jacket engineer you try the semtex i'll go with that don't use the ak why not try it out hey team have i ever seen trailer park boys or letter kenny uh i always wonder what you drive i drive a golf i'm very sensible so i would never buy a lamborghini i would never spend that much money on a car i don't love cars enough i can appreciate a nice car i love the way that lamborghinis look and the way they feel sorts of cars i can appreciate the art and the engineering and design that's gone into it but i would never i would never spend that much money on a car domination maybe i 80s action movie uh there's so many good ones isn't there don't leave me this way enemy has fox drop you just wanted the tank did you okay bravo yeah we're gonna drop two codes now xbox on pc let's just take a look at this ak it's kind of the american propaganda ak it's got a flashlight on it as well uh if you think about it like that bravo deltier lamborghini is owned by volkswagen so a golf is basically a lamborghini yeah that's it man that's it oh i do drive a lambo after all how do i turn off the flashlight there must be a way of doing it securing delta enemies taking charlie who's contesting this are they above grenade oh right there charlie lock down losing speed right in the grass loads up here we need to turn round lads oh ruined jack in the box i don't know what that means elijah sorry can i cross this without being sniped play chicken free ducati is also owned by a volkswagen okay so i've got a ducati as well are you telling me a golf is a lambo and a ducati or a ducati depending on your pronunciation in one rolled up together taking a he's secured there's a tank over there saw that dude on the minimum he's got a sniper lemon yeah i don't want to go and challenge that sniper because i've only got an einstein inbound oh i should have just aimed with the ak multiple enemy spy planes ruin my kill streak aka is pretty nice though so is it k for flashlight is that true losing e no although i need to find out losing charlie we lost e five how do you turn the flashlight off maybe you can't turn it off in multiplayer let's try all the things all the buttons it's a waypoint that's a ping point yeah k doesn't work guys i'm pressing it nothing's happening thank you thank you dunno let's make moments in this game funny moments how many pc codes left uh maybe two more codes or one more one more of each hostile spy plane established overhead multiple enemy spy plane contacts fk no it's not f i mean everyone knows that f is to pay respects right so it doesn't work i mean you can go through every single key guys losing filter 5g g's grenade losing charlie i didn't see it in the menu sir the flashlight will stay on forever i'll just give my position away it's fine okay with it there's a sniper out there nice shot all on f4 i don't think that's it gary i don't think that's the one but someone said they wanted to see the frame rate so there you go well as soon as i did that my frame rate dropped for some reason i don't know why uh we haven't got dlss on or anything have we losing delta hostile spy plane established over here the lss is crazy though it's absolutely insane you guys know what it does basically ai oppressing enemy spy player good way of saying it let me see if i can demonstrate so what you're looking at here is a native 1440p image securing and on the stream it's 4k though that's just for quality reasons it gets a higher bitrate but that's another story so we're getting 116 117 fps and then you turn dlss on and it will render the game at a lower resolution and upscale it using artificial intelligence can you tell any difference and look at the frame rate so that added about 20 fps and that's the quality mode you can go even more extreme than that let's go balance look any different 140 fps and then let's go to the extreme uh ultra performance okay right you can see that's but that's different now isn't it but look at the frame rate should be better damage yeah framerate didn't really change much there did it it's really interesting but you see that's quite blurry now because the game is rendering at a much lower resolution it's not quite as sharp is it it's just a really interesting technology mission's going pear-shaped keep fighting security yeah it's crazy i'm using it for my uh 4k stuff you know in in games that support 4k it's really good [Music] uh artistic soldiers thank you for becoming a member uh what graphics cards 39. play of the game right okay we're gonna do sniping now cheeky bit of sniping i think all right we're gonna drop the last two codes here guys one pc code one xbox code first come first serve if you got

video a team it's a good one it's definitely a good one thank you man i appreciate you sticking around and i hope things get better for you no i don't like this map at all i'm not a fan of this map it's so messy quite much could do sniping on armada i mean we could try sniping one of the multiplayer maps actually it keeps doing this thing where it's contacting servers for ages i don't know what that's about it looks like a cartoon that's interesting queen you think this game looks like a cartoon are you doing raheem thank you for coming no one likes miami it's too dark hey tom yeah it's going alright we're just trying different guns every game just want to show people the new guns some of them aren't very viable at the moment because i've not leveled them up but it's all right isaac thank you for the 20. hope you will i'm good dude love watching stay healthy stay safe that's really kind of you man thanks hope you're all right buddy hardpoint this is the lw 3 tundra identified looks like uh oh from cst well sometimes they call it the l96 don't they in other games i suppose this is what a sniper would do right i'm gonna get flanked by someone with an mp5 [Music] target dropped indeed you peeking that again huh we're camping now boys we have become the camp hopefully the next point comes over here that'd be good no it's gone that way they're gonna run across there maybe do a reload located hardpoint locked down [Music] someone's looking at me aren't they standing by i missed all the shots there what about him otherwise song requesting spy plane testing and jump over that now throwing stun how many maps there's eight multiplayer maps for him i think it needs a couple more there's two dirty bomb fire team maps zombies and this campaign what are you doing there buddy you don't get how warzone is going to integrate um well warzone isn't going to integrate at all all that's going to happen is there'll be cold war weapons in warzone but they will make war zone versions of those weapons so they won't just losing this fight they can't just copy paste the information and the stats because it wouldn't work it wouldn't be balanced you get what i'm saying oh you weren't part of the plan identified and then there'll probably be a new area of the map added some people have already rumored that it's going to be alcatraz like in cod mobile and then i guess what will happen is that the map will slowly change there'll be some kind of an event and it will start to incorporate some stuff that kind of looks like cold war [Music] yeah have some things you want things we can give you things hostiles have captured the hard points and cash guys been killed am i on the radar there maybe you heard me reload i don't know i've got ghosts so i shouldn't have been on there but it wasn't a chess shot annoying stun grenade out throwing stunts weird noises oh no someone over here i think if i play this game long term i'll snipe sniping is so good in this it's really satisfying he could build a really fast firing l mighty six that'd be sweet oh the other one the pellington or whatever it's called still not quite used to that ttk as well that noise was so weird yeah we make some weird noises here it's fine you get used to it package is secure not just a random chopper gunner on the ground syntax [Music] need to get used to it i don't like the ui strange hard point lost sure there was a guy there enemy spy plane inbound well maybe not powerpoint is secure [Music] hit the noscope again only leg shots uh mandela thank you for becoming a phantom that's very very kindly i appreciate that [Music] i need to play more campy again oh the hell was that noise that sounded like someone just smashing a dinner plate on the ground smash you can pick that angle there thing is you can't you don't get the action here i do kind of miss the parkour from the modern warfare there's a little bit of it but not much it's kind of fun to walk around modern warfare and like create interesting routes from the parkour enemy attack kilo above sound grenade [Music] ah oh the chopper got me dude please give me a break can't even see the helicopter where is it enemy care package above god got so much health i need to get a [Music] stinger lost this little window there [Music] oh my god he just set me on fire with his boat that was sick goodbye m16 that looks sick nice kill streak level 52 oh hello look at that you level up quite slowly in this that was the l96 ellington let's go magnum why are they always playing carcasses it's a training thing isn't it i think the game's crashed oh we're back it just hung for a little while moscow no one will ever play miami ever again it's ruined cheers win thanks for becoming a member now tom i'm definitely gonna be playing warzone more than this 100 i'll play this to level up the guns for war zone because they've said that you can level up guns in this and then when they get put in war zone they won't be at level zero they'll be at whatever level you've got them to in this game that's what i'll do take the objectives securing alpha danny thanks for the five why is miami ruined no one likes it no one ever ever picks it [Music] oh that's a nice looking m16 burst fire hello are you coming taking charlie you were right there marching waypoint come on you know you want it they're waiting here i'm gonna go crazy we're okay what is this skin losing b so this m16 builds actually not bad [Music] oh my god there's so many people i need to copy that build secured hold your positions i was going to go for the sliding noscope losing charlie uh i didn't purchase it lewis i was given a code by activision i think it's the ultimate edition oh why were you there grenade out enemy spy play inbound um hey amanda how you doing from australia awesome what's up hairy larry what's the best monitor for me to get from my ps5 do i go 4k 60 or 1080p 144. if you get an hdmi 2.1 monitor you can get the best of both worlds obviously it's going to be a bit more expensive though right multiple enemies throwing stunts oh that was a two-shot kill obviously not a bit random down i like this revolver artillery hey foo fire how you doing what was that about my proximity mines that's really not your budget i would go make sure you get one that can do 1080p 120 at least because 120 hertz is so nice for the new consoles but at the same time there's a lot of gorgeous looking 4k games that you you might miss out on i didn't connect the second shot is that a wing man no it's just a revolver oh i was about to light him up boom is there any way to find an xbox series x joshua i would just sign up to a waiting list on your local game store or amazon switching rally points what's up gaming poop how you going hey joshua bill welcome back holly how's it going hey chris pope seize the objectives supreme senate it's probably gone then i'll be gone by now someone would have taken it charlie secured securing bravo sbmm uh steve thanks for the five sure there's someone else here oh how was that not on losing i was crazy i like it was on him big mac i had a big mac earlier i don't think i've ever had a bad big mac throwing stun why do people just thrown on the ground man oh god i don't get how it's fun joe thanks for becoming a member artillery i am doing a video on 120 hertz go look out for that securing bravo there's a lot of people don't really understand what it means or what it does or how to get it there's a lot of people i've seen on twitter any youtube comments that think your monitor hurts is the same as the frame rate of the game and that confuses let's say you're running a playstation 5 game so it's capped at 60fps but your display is running at 4k 120. it doesn't mean that the game will then magically run in 120 frames per second it doesn't work like that it's up to the developers for the consoles at least to put game modes in that support those frame rates down i don't want that fight thanks for becoming a member let's go home how does flash damage work that's what i want to know damn it you did the work of a nation come on home a pistol only rounds no i'd get ruined how tall am i six foot one 26 rams that's right joshua 26. my name is charlie in real life so i love these type of games because it feels like i'm in them is that because they say charlie or design charlie right i think we've got time for one more match miami come on vote miami let's go we've not played it the whole night the snipers are pretty good in this game aren't they really good i'll use the creek a bit m4 food oh come on don't even have a sight unlock for it yet what cartel charlie oscar delta mike over foxtrot delta golf lemur foxtrot charlie over my no miami miami's not allowed why would you do this out those stuns are brutal and you need that perk don't you flak jacket okay no footsteps sounds cool what's up andrew hey abdullah casey what's up man thank you for becoming a member [Music] oh my god what okay siri just thought that i asked about nutritious facts about almonds when i said that how does that no a series crazy she just hears things that i don't say i don't get it there it is again what is that movement man that is crazy i think they're gonna have to look at that because that is that's like the third time that's happened where the movement is just like looks like pac-man or something really weird lost [Music] nice contesting camouflage located where is everyone [Music] action [Music] ruined joshua thank you man how is this even fun compared to warzone it's a different type of game isn't it warzone's a br game this is a classic arcade card game but i do think that call of duty is becoming war zone and i don't think that they'll be able to sustain this kind of like yearly release anymore because everyone's playing war zone now this type of cod game just isn't as popular anymore it feels like old-fashioned doesn't it because it's an arcade shooter at the end of the day so the audience for that has moved on [Music] i can't believe that guy got me i stunned him twice and grenaded it yeah i think carter kind of competing with themselves this year as well that dugout there's still loads of people playing modern warfare and now this is out does that mean that modern warfare isn't going to get any more support i don't know i don't know if they'll do that because modern warfare is still really popular so it's interesting interesting times for the gaming industry [Music] hey way on that centex is awful overhead i'm so glad i killed that first guy hard lost hardcore locked down i feel safe here not anymore artillery what the hell is going on no this is pc okay just get stunned all the time what the hell man emily thank you man above make the cia proud [Music] i do think that skill-based matchmaking is going to turn a lot of people off as well with this game war machine that's not good sounds like a firework doesn't it they want you to have a 1.1 kill death ratio that's what they want located [Music] out there's one here he might save money [Music] oh whoa whoa whoa whoa i get that nade off i did and i got a kill i think we're counting this okay i'll do it we've lost the hard point artillery targeting detective [Music] they're gonna be coming from there aren't they that's the win
