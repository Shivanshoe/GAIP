hi guys and welcome back to tiny tina's wonderlands part three today joined by mr tomographic there he is jumping up and down you can emote tommy about to die ow hold on i need to get you i don't i mean this is definitely an exciting introduction to the video i told you this would happen never listen what do you mean we literally just spoke to each other for the first time today i mean hi jack oh you're live yeah oh god i accidentally you know streaming are you a streamer no well some sometimes yeah anyways there's a man in this box there is a man in the box uh big thanks to epic games for sponsoring this one today as always guys if you buy this game or any others on the epic game store do consider using my creative code jack frags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that don't you dare shake your head tomorrow i see what you're doing i should have muted shouldn't i so we can't hear me don't forget to like and subscribe for more content like this yeah that's better that was on the sheet smash that like button um smash that like button nice with a hammer nice clawless anyways so yesterday we got through the uh the pirate section i did that on my own because uh tommo like did some like went to his mom or something like god can you believe that instead of playing games with me for free as a friend he just went and saw his mom shocking behavior anyway so there's a guy in this box here i think right we have to pull the lever his name's phil his name's stop can you hear me you fell for the oldest trick in the book believer that seems to be a release what it was it was a trap i didn't see what was happening behind us i didn't mention as well like even though you're much lower level than me the game does some kind of magical scaling where it goes everything's fine yeah so i'm level 13 at the moment so i'm fighting level 13 enemies and you're fighting level yeah do you think it means that you just take less damage from them um do you do more damage i think everything scales the damage they deal the damage ideal [Music] okay fine certificate of non-evilness what's over here tom it's over here tom and what's the other one find directions to phil's cave we can just ignore these crabs our erections yeah they're bloody annoying to fight they are i don't like them at all crab rave there's something here this map only shows where the local town is you better find a local then okay so that's the directions yeah over here but we need the certificate of non-evilness a local townsman maybe oh yeah we fought snakes yesterday as well snakes snakes on a plane big snakes yeah baby big big big snake that pirate guy looks like a local maybe he'll help us out yeah but we'll have to act the part new pirate stuff come you wrote these uh i actually hate them so much how they're resisting my attack because i've got acid damage these guys are fire kill these guys are fire bro i found the local i'm as much a pirate as anybody avast and matey and such guess yes why is she like tripping balls tom look at that you'll have to prove it there's no music thomas i shall i mean if you turn it off i hear a little bit of music yeah but she's dancing like she's a bloody glass yeah yeah do love me somebody as for phil's cave it's just down the way good luck getting in though oh and some other sea dogs went down there to try to lie already so you might have some competition you eat himself huh we've got to follow this uh surly thin breaker i know he stopped he's got it disappeared a poetry page oh he vanished completely yeah he just disappeared got a blink of an eye just decomposed into nothing coiled sand stalker before these yet yeah yeah this pistol that i've got is sick dude like it fires ice bullets and also it's got secondary fire with rockets see how it's like um freezing though because i've got a variable scope no i can zoom in hasn't got like a fire well it just changes from pistol to rockets i guess killing these is good because we'll get you xp right this world yeah but if it scales i don't think it really that spell is nuts it's just 400 damage that's the thing though my spells do a lot of damage so i get thrown very quickly this gun's nuts as well how much damage it does so it's insane it sticks them with multiple bombs and then they explode watch dead watch ready we're here am i watching this on the right left oh oh god oh yeah these are a thing now as well mimics sometimes you open chests and they turn into aliens oh yeah i've got two game codes to give away chat by the way today another two today so i'll drop those in the chat at some point and then i'll steal them and then thomas will sell them on the internet you shut up and you let the others figure out we've got pulleys in a certain sequence phil's puzzle uh box puzzle parts box puzzle parts it's a box of puzzle parts behind you there's a thing there on the wall puzzles look at the green thing yeah so does that change yeah it does i think they'll have to be facing the same way no no that was a square [Music] if only there was some sort of image somewhere that had the solution it just said wow do you think we'll find it i was just about to say it's it's literally on the floor it's a square in the bottom right isn't it all right can't leave it leave it it was right but okay it wasn't right though no you're not doing the white line you're cop you're supposed to be cooking oh i'm an idiot jack are well yeah the black ones you have to ignore it's just there to distract you i guess this game's trolled me so many times by the way no it does all right fine i'm a voice for your emotions is that what you want to hear hey that's adam uh i watched the first season and then that's it you'd like that if you if you continue it because it's set in the same um universe like this is probably 99 and there's an episode where there's a crossover and it's hilarious so there's like an episode of brooklyn nine-nine but they're in the same universe yeah so like i think like new new girl goes to new york at one point and she like crashes a car and andy sandberg no no yeah any sound big like takes her car from her because he needs to use it for police duty or whatever so there's like an episode in both shows where that same thing happens like has different outcomes it's really well done uh we pull this pusco see that looked super evil certificate for the funniest person in my life is that's you need right certificate of non-evilness yeah you've done it and that's queen but stallion's hoof print right is this me anywhere look it's here isn't it it tells you what to do i could have worked that one out did you know by the way i realized this yesterday the more of those dice that you find the better loot you get no i didn't know that i thought it just levels you up and i've been playing the game like why do i never get any purples or exotics so you need to go find the dicey [ __ ] jack oh hello thomas hello abby johnson lightning boy what's up worker thank you for coming to the stream we're going to be here for a few hours myself and tomorrow having a good laugh see it's a good laugh in the new call of duty tiny tina's wonderlands [Music] fish that swim away from you when you walk next to them underwater you believe that was the thing that was actually part of their market a talking point pretty sure had been in games for years just and it was only in one campaign level i would have loved to have received that influencer briefing yeah here's what you can talk about what about the fishy eye oh the two [ __ ] absolutely smash them down as well i saw some gameplay of that um lego star wars game yesterday as well yeah battlefront update so maybe i played a demo i haven't played money myself i think i played the lego batman game oh yeah that was good i think i'll try to demo that um the new star wars one though it's nuts it's like an open world game with like third person shooting combat there's like quests and abilities skills it's really in depth indeed i killed them in fact you can fly the ships as well anywhere um i don't know about anywhere but like i saw like like battlefront updates had gameplay of like flying boba fett ship and flying pro diamonds x-wing and there's all sorts of different planets it looks great quite funny as well yeah they they like the humor it's like this game is this game available on console like ps5 yes thomas it is it came out on the 25th a couple days ago it's not on steam though is it it's an epic exclusive so phil put creepy totems around town that sounds like it could be bad who is this phil guy [Music] can you suggest a good lego game i don't really know many johnson because i haven't played them so i don't think i can give you a fair recommendation but i'm sure lots of the lego games are good like the harry potter ones and the star wars ones where'd that thing come from tom just mentioned like the batman ones as well oh my god a hammerhead a good laugh he just seems to anger on me he doesn't really care for much else he's stuck he can't get to me whoa you see we just jumped in the sky like in that battlefield easter egg it's a megalodon that's a reference again fret is wonder sikes is that oh the comedian tom is that the one this is one of the things you're telling me about a minute jump scared me a little bit it's fine oh a lot really yeah a beard out of that as well a beard on the ground yeah someone's beard a beard on the ground okay sell some stuff this reminds me of god of war but with guns i'm not seeing the people it's probably because you look like god of war you look like kratos do i i think star i have been working out a lot well you haven't changed your characters like i mean the skin pigment is still the stone color that i guess kratos has boy boy soundtrack on that game oh so damn good makes me weep like an infant makes you weep yeah it makes me cry dude i listen to the soundtrack and i just like what he's lying i just uh sold all the stuff i don't want to sell oh good something tells me i still need this i do that you can buy it back how are we gonna get on there then that my theory is correct and i don't suppose you're ready to share that people yeah i'm definitely here now yeah now you've been told it's easy yeah i can't do it this new gun's pretty cool [Music] it was a minor problem here tom dealt with it um where does fireworks come from uh my gun yeah i don't know why my gun fires fireworks but it does oh where's all those things [Music] come here are you down there yeah look they just hide in little places ah better loot tom yes find all the others 22 on this level alone yeah that's the thing like i'd rather just make rig i said we found plenty of not in our time playing but i guess not okay we're gonna go get another toaster and then find phil apparently wanda sykes is co-hosting the oscars tonight wow i don't know the oscars tonight yeah i think it is right crap sorry you can kill something right can you kill someone get back up uh they've all got big hp for me okay is there a tldw for this game is it any good i like the occasional casual shooter losers with zero expectations is the pc version good i mean the pc yeah it's just more borderlands with a medieval vibe and more spells more i think i'd say there's more of a focus on combat and you've got abilities and stuff but such a grand arsenal yeah it's not open world either really like the if you get bored of a certain set of abilities like consciousness multiple classes [Music] yeah the pc version runs great for me i mean the mouse feels good performance is good no complaints [Music] what's up justin hey tyler you know it seems like phil actually put those totems around to produce from the monsters i found another thing jack it's underneath this look oh who is it how do i get under there really well now that i figured it out so you look like smarties whatever now that we've destroyed no there's no friendly fire yeah i mean if you just want like a mindless lure shooter yeah this will hit the spot you can kind of be two glasses at once as well in this which is cool yeah i would say if you're more interested in an actual like coherent story then borderlands 3 might hit the spot better but yeah this game definitely satisfies the uh [Music] [Music] oh sorry i'll go and change my voice box then hey dave what's up dope truck is there cross play yeah i think so rogue zero how you doing man hey peter oscars it's tonight seven pm okay so mason thank you for coming into the jail compound oh my goodness it's a big one when we hear earlier uh i don't know we've done a loop around and we've come back to where we were just looks a little similar maybe yeah blow us god what did i spend all this money on this smg to do like just trash one damage per hit oh i guess it's got a bleed on it okay yeah does it have an alternate fire or something nope [Music] there's a ramp here i can jump up maybe oh my god fish that's such a cool attack what the dogfish well you've got an attack that's a dog fish no no no you know the shark things things they're called dogs but they do like an actual megalodon [Music] they're jumping out of water [Music] yeah thomas i played solo yesterday it's fine scales as well you know you can concentrate a bit more on the story if you play solo definitely helped to have knowledge of borderlands though because obviously it's a focus like on one of the specific characters in the game yeah if you like tiny tina you'll probably like that tiny tina's wonderland this is the game for you [Music] open your eyes you're playing your eyes closed again yeah sometimes i do it's not another puzzle nope raquarius cliffside platforming oh great fireworks [Music] feel like an avenger [Music] [Music] yeah it runs really well performance is great [Music] just being mad at me find another way in so weird okay we got your fps counter wrong no i've just locked it to 120. i did the same but mine's pretty much capping it the entire time [Music] oh it's there we have to use the canon [Applause] it is a borderlands game jake it just doesn't have the same name i think like a lot of people are gonna like that's the play on words for it yeah they did do uh tiny tina like expansions in the past i think it was was it borderlands 2 what you uh i don't remember i played all the last games i don't know if i played the dlcs yeah i think a lot of people might be like i don't know what that is like if they'd have called it like borderlands tiny tina's wonderland like i think maybe a lot more people would know what it is yeah it sounds like a dlc on its own doesn't it if it was called board lands tiny tina's wonderlands then you'd think it's a dlc so they have to make it its own thing it's a spin-off of borderlands essentially but like any for the last fan will know who tiny tina is yeah it's for the fans yeah but there is something for everyone even if you're not a fan of both lands or played any games before just here time i just opened cool oh i needed that i don't know what that was for this one next to the ring [Music] jesus screaming as hell [Music] did you find my [Music] well that's a relief have you developed a defensive strategy they'll be calling my case any moment now hear me hear me this be judged you guys are the only ones who call me that shut up nerd jerk i heard that crap if there be anyone who would stand go to pirate court clearly evil jump sack you must report to the courthouse [Music] more interested in buying stuff at this stage yeah that's a good way of putting it pg quips like the the spells almost replace grenades in a lot of ways uh your big aoe attacks yeah but they also play into the way that you build your character which is cool i still not got the bottom left one no neither gold or purple armor like ah like all right let's do this see you later thomas thank you for coming you're there i've gotta sell some stuff to buy this sniper i need a defense for this seems a little harsh and probably guilty we will begin momentarily you're gonna have to try and prove his innocence okay what's your plan perhaps i can appeal to the better angels of their nature do pirates have those i'd settle for okay angels in a pitch no listen just present the certificate and tell them i'm a really decent guy who just wants to help i'm sure that'll fly court is now in session i'm a lawyer now i'm daredevil i'm a really good lawyer we are here to prosecute the case of one crooked eye phil who has been accused of being super evil by pretty much everybody if the defense has any new evidence to present do so now yes he's a really good guy of non-evilness from the infallible hoof of queen butt stallion herself what and he holds a goal tom overrule look for easter eggs you know you can't do that keep up these shenanigans and i'll hold you in contempt of court and in general now i must confer with my counsel about the evidence presented er er i yar yar yaw yar i yaw [Music] great yeah i'm not really sure what happened there i think it was probably like you're a little hit like kill the judge just a guy drinking beer here [Music] normal sunday she's talking about downloading software because she's a pirate that's basically zero damage to this thing look at this uh this woman just [Music] there's nothing in it [Music] you fell down did you oh is that my first anxiety it wasn't intentional i mean there is some loot down there how much money do you have jack i have 140 000 whoa whoa yeah

overworld sweet uh no playstation codes uh cody sorry only pc it's not that far away tom um if we go around here back to this yeah remember if you get attacked in the ground i've lost way more of it since i last played yeah i've done a fair bit yeah smack them away how do we get up that and get the orb thing the lucky dice i think we have to unlock something um i don't know what though there's an eraser here we can use as a bridge did you try and eat those when you were a kid yeah and you get scented ones i succeeded [Music] i sharpen them i tape them to rulers and then like made them catapults oh wow hey blazing angels taste you use them as weapons yeah you tape the eraser to the ruler then pull the ruler back and it adds weight to it and then you know just like hit you me with it see me after class thomas fine and then you have sex but i'm owning this villain thing okay world's not going to cover itself in darkness you know i remember those little scented pens that you could get as well yeah remember and the clicky ones yeah with a picture of no girl not one of those in my school two nine four that's a lot of damage don't worry why does this stuff cost so much what is it i can't buy any of it all right sell sell sell oh i needed that buy back i don't think that hits hard because it's got a really slow rate of fire what's up savage dean sorry something everything up from now on yeah it's a good idea i mean leaving a lot of little on the ground based on his stats whereas i've got enough space in my bag to at least pick it up [Music] oh you know i want to touch that it's make yourself known i had a name long ago but now they just call me the western sorry what's a bastard oh you know what jack says ah this relic dick move a dick noise to defeat the dragon lord and save the enemy from encroaching oh nice i'm going to count with him we're going the same way it's wood i need to get my bomb how you destiny vibes yeah these are a bit destiny these columns with green glowing alien writing on is that hard in general like borderlands gets compared to destiny quite a bit i think it probably inspired us to me a lot [Music] so now we can use those in the open world [Music] the damage is pretty good here i think we can do this [Music] you're such a bastard it's a hollow sight yeah it does look like a loser it takes the whole screen there's a big skull up there what is this what's happening oh yeah that's cool a skeleton rib cage isn't cool right myself a skeleton let me see if i can still magic it down in this form i love the level design in this game in general we go up here somehow on top of that i think he's making a bridge ah something [Music] oh we're gonna go all the way up there over there but uh oh perfect those rocks are being held up by the raw quartz inside you can probably move them around if you shoot the cords that's what i was trying to get on top of you can shoot it to move it yeah the purple bit of the bomb wow wow where's he-man they don't have he-man in this game for sure and i get real hard um i've fought skeletons before okay you've been rinsed i've been absolutely mashed up i feel like a superhero hey booney what's up say hello to the lads for me all the land in this case is tomographic hi tomographic hi jackfrags how are you doing i'm doing yes correct there's an interaction for you i need to do my melee more geez melee's really good and take damage it's like so long to wind up yeah these are a bit tanky like but they're taken i'm about to level up how's the game so far it's good seth i mean i've enjoyed the um the second and third parts more than the first it's just more the route they've boring in this particular game in terms of explaining a lot of dungeons and dragons isms that a lot of people might not understand the average smoothie you don't understand based on the actual game so if i found a lucky dice i'll drop some blue if you need it come and take a look where's wasted gone though we have to just watch his back but where is that where's wasted what the hell i just got a fancy reload it's like a wave of magic wand then it reloaded my gun e-string easter egg reload oh there's a big dragon here okay oh god he's massive you need uh have you got any acid it's got top layer down oh god that is pain i missed with my hammer there we go i'll work on getting the acid down and then you just do the main damage are you winning son ah the reload that spells really good but you have to shoot the barrel at the right point it just douses them in poison i've been using this this is a poison gun i think i'm dead just mrs [Music] who wants to get vanquished die i should have used this small i'm bloody hell dead was a bit of a fight wasn't it i was bit of a slog khaleesi came out of nowhere some of the dragons ah khaleesi i've got the grayscale oh what else is hitting me now there's another dragon in this okay good job can you switch from first to third person no you can't dennis

and it's precisely four whoa jack my hammer does more damage to me than me um this spell that i've got if i get a kill with it it instantly rejects no way yeah yeah i got about four inches myself it makes an interesting conversation no it does it's perfect they do be hitting hard though i'm gonna go do the objective yes i'm good i'll just suffer oh no i got about four stop myself tomorrow came over i don't think i'm gonna be able to save myself okay i'm up kill the elevator guards we just have to clear this areas on roman jones bloody noisy these bloody skeletons what a bloody noise i said

want to get some health back dude i keep getting owned by these enemies dude i'm not gonna lie i need i need to level up a bit i mean i can manage you can manage but it's different i can manage i can't finish them off yeah i've got about four spots myself it's cool this gun has like ricochet so it like it does damage to the one enemy and bounces off and it's another yeah that's it as always good try silver there ow can you get that hold on let's just kill his boss okay absolutely oh yeah he hates it he does he's teleported cody thank you i think you can change the field of view yeah you

of december whereas most people have it on the 25th yeah it's crazy the day that um celebrates the birth of jesus christ it's just mad that it's different days yeah it's because of the time it's because of the time difference that's it the shepherds and the and mary yeah they're on a different difference it has to be a full moon as well otherwise it's just illegal to celebrate oh god oh look

i don't know exactly what that means but he's not the first person who said that today i'm gonna drop a code in the chat here guys for a tiny tina's wonderland on the epic game store big thanks to them for sponsoring today first come first serve if you get it let me know you're one eighth undead one-eighth undead claim cool as long as it doesn't show up on john a cat i have eight lives your powers won't be as potent as mine so you've seen the trailer for the new plus of boots maybe like this one over here no give it a shot it's about nine lives it's good um maybe i have like you've only got one life cat make the most of it it's basically a metaphor for real life and we're gonna die oh classic classic i haven't finished business here so i can only wish you good luck on your quest you're going to need it i wish i could do heaviest house as well you know the land itself thirsting beneath your boots [Music] yeah i think it depends on your mellow weapon okay because some like like some have a really slow speed but they do big attack or some have really light like you can just continuously melee but they do less damage yeah dude i swear i've seen like that i've seen that in destiny in destiny 2 i swear as a god oh my god yeah actually i've seen that i've seen that in um what game is it um like on a roof somewhere doing a puzzle remnant from the ashes yeah [Music] a poetry page wafts upon the wind nearby you see this i think this might be over leveled for us now let me take a look soul purpose level 27 what level are you 20 i'm 23. i'm 16. i mean we'll give it a try but no actually you're going to get pummeled aren't you yeah that's the level we can try it you'll try it yeah it'll scale them right there is a oh no enemy levels begin at 27. you're at least two levels maybe not maybe not let's do some cycles [Laughter] i'm sorry what do you think ominous means exactly uh foreboding threatening inauspicious inauspicious it's a good word isn't it inauspicious putting aside my other shirt yeah guys even if you get free stuff on the epic game store you can use my code as well it's good to use it because it just shows the epic that you know people are using my code i'll use code jack franks thomas uses it yeah and he's got four inches yeah it improved my size yep there you go why is that red oh i'm not high enough level for that oh baby that's a nice man whoa i just got a good one i need this shoots a magical blast of energy is that a rocket launcher magical blast of energy magical blue yeah you have to buy it i just can't not buy it there we go we'll get all my money gone instantly gone we're instantly gone and just like that his money was instantly gone galaxy oh yeah yeah what'd you get oh i thought it was really cool but it's literally a gun that i've been having since the start of the game but oh no you know like a shotgun has crystals at the top of it yeah you do the salt bay oh yeah it's basically a more improved version of that great thank god that was how i wasted all that money how much can i sell it for ah half the price lovely uh i just reloaded and my gun turned into a dragon with a gun for a body you see this um oh oh yeah that's normal that's normal what happens when you shoot a second time okay that's weird i like it though i reload and it spawns yeah that's been that's been in uh previous borderlands games it basically shoots enemies when they're there it's just like a rare reload thing that helps you okay it will just fly around shoot enemies and then time out i'm down and down it's just a reload hook down for that yeah sentinel hess oh hear me outsider you may look upon the grandeur of our oasis why is there three health bars one of them is for my companion the lichen at least oh i just did a reload and it did that but just put three dragons just eating her is that a mod then on your gun yeah well it's just like some weapons have rare attributes that's weird wow did i write the script for this game yes say um wait what say what did i just do what did i just do dude how are you writing the script for this game i see the wizard never reveals his tricks i mean the wasted never reveals morton from sydney hi john [Music] that's a weird title down and instead you have released the spirit of solicit the evil coiled water goddess now her foulness will thank you jason appreciate the donor turning them into blood thirsty thralls see goodness here they come i played any of the other board last games yeah i played like one two and three [Applause] on twitter more than one million views in within a month congrats ryder that's awesome shows man you put some effort into a video it doesn't really matter what game it is well never rush videos instead of spending days being the last person to cover a game yeah spring up ahead i hate that gun sound it's not the best johnson but i like the gun though it does a lot of this one oh right yeah just sound a bit tinny alpha oh there's a bit sea of thieves isn't it it is yeah it's been a really good like diversity in the levels and stuff yeah this reminds me of serious sound do you ever play that game serious serious yeah i know serious sam it's my favorite game oh yeah sand sand sam yeah [Music] this is like a new big concept i remember in borderlands 3 you had a gun where you you reloaded it and it turned into like a little turret with legs in borderlands three yeah borderlands three yeah um though you and your friends get different things all the time i'm going to just suck me off like he could come and join us if he wants to play with him i know i wish he would i kind of like him i kind of like him just a little bit i prefer his mom hey sober hey zero what how come the games are you looking forward to this yeah clearly he does as well god of war ragnarok modern warfare 2 war zone 2. fighting real monsters at the moment uh the harry potter game yeah that'd be cool harry potter oh she's going to kill me so it's kind of like borderlands it is a borderlands game see that's what i mean about like we were talking earlier like a lot of people just aren't going to know what this is because the title they'll be like tiny teen does what we wait what is that tiny tina's wonder hands see that chat with garrett they could have called harry potter games business why why don't they make a disney world game instead it's better than harry potter land anyways [Laughter] yeah dude i can't wait to go and get that man i love jedi fall in order such a big so good yeah it's one of my favorites in recent years he was really good too i hope he gets like putting on the movie someday i think so i reckon they will actually act out his role because they showed um like a well it wasn't bd1 but it was a bd model i showed that droid type here yeah still speedy type droid most people like don't even know your name's jack yeah and potions to prepare for the fight this is not even means shut up yeah why did you make this guy such a dirk face oh yeah me too collect seawork hearts so where do we get them from um i guess i suppose it's like an enemy type you have to kill and then just take the hearts oh they're over here something holy level 16 almost 17. that's like yeah who knows we married and he didn't want to take my second name so yeah you can understand why yeah i mean thomas franklin why would i why would i get yourself why would you get my name hey do you think about this yeah everything's right that's my middle name tell me to think about this remember not to do all the side quests if you do that on max level you get dedicated quest rewards on max level yeah i don't really care that much bloody power to be honest i just want to get to the uh the level requirement for the main quest didn't ask her didn't ask helpless ratio no no i thank you for the tip but um nobody else i don't think i'm going to be playing the game that you know that late game that i've uh you know i care about that kind of stuff uh there's a whole village here thomas okay there's a slide here as well look at this a slide yeah oh wow i've just completely missed it and fallen off that's good maybe this is dice though i really wanted to go down because of what you did earlier with the chest oh there's actually a slide that's cool you walk up to it and push in a slide animation yeah yeah serious sam was like um the name doesn't give me an instant memory of it 2001 2002 maybe basically one guy with like uh 10 weapons and a like a shed load of enemies just constantly attack you as you try and get through the level it's that kind of old school guns yeah what do you mean ben 10 with [Laughter] nice has jack on any legendaries yet i've got one yeah he's named somo uh my legendary is that one i don't know was that an exotic exactly i will catch you legends you're close to a marble who says that oh that tomorrow is that your outro now it's like um what's now that's what i'll say after like a an intro commentary tomographic doing content we have a wild leicester spotted demographic descendants of yeah first i've lost you jack i'm uh just come over here yeah oh god i'm dying how much you just the the compass is showing like two directions i went the wrong one you just come this way you we need to go over there anyway tom i found your phone yeah but we need to go back that way anyway oh great

inquisitive yes okay we've got to go get back three things [Music] ocean cellar my potions are strong stronger than any in the land oceanside my gun isn't doing damage ocean sound that's such a good i'm not sure stupid [Music] see you later johnson i want to sleep because tomorrow i got school and it's 2 45 a.m i need to sleep but like four hours hey johnson right johnson i hope your day at school goes okay do you think his last name is baby oil yes i'll return you to your turn when i'll come probably not do you have a kirby strength potion taylor i don't know what that means kirby just released a nail or something there's some sort of kirby thing going on i'm not sure but you know what the concrete balls they have outside of shops to stop like cars i guess i guess that's what they're for what they're ready for just like the random concrete balls are outside cinemas and stuff yeah well they like wrapped the ones outside of target in like these kirby they painted them over things well yeah they're like it's like a piece of fabric that kirby's face on it but they just make kirby cover those things outside target is there anything about it yesterday i think there's something kirby related i don't know came out like yesterday all the day before i don't [Music] teeny tiny [Music] i keep losing you i'm gonna die thomas oh you're miles away from me thomas please christmas objectives right here chris away are you dead yeah i'll respond you just gotta go pick up that objective okay see you later vault i hope you enjoyed the code and your time with the game appreciate you being here eamon jack you're still playing bf5 yeah occasionally that'll be a bf5 video next week next week is going to be just battlefield videos i think when are you and tomorrow getting engaged we're already married dion we got engaged yeah 2012 in new york isn't it i think yeah you proposed new york yeah how was it such a nice meal we went for as well before we went to the rockefeller center and they had some place they're called frankie and benny and afterwards so good your ability to collect items is unparalleled oh no that other word unremarkable now back to the ice cream we went out for dinner and then came over dessert didn't we joe oh there we go yes tom where are we going oh i see over here please keep remember look at the compass we went this way before right yeah you gotta go back that way but we have to do a secondary thing right place the standards so they interrupt the primary lay line uh bio-four said is it nice links with someone who doesn't dive to full damage every 20 minutes she's gone will now begin reconstituting in the throne the difference is though is though you're always falling for me the stone's always falling for himself through through the floor and i like his videos but then like he showed everyone how to do his thing and then everyone just copied him but he does it the best you get joel he does like this really weird style where it looks like a video game cartoon kind of thing it just skips more villains i've got a lot of stuff yeah i'm looking at my inventory right now [Music] uh what's that noise uh enemies what is some wet they threw something wet at me tom hmm is this made by the board borderlands team yeah oh my god i'm just going to not answer any more questions about that i'm just not no refuse but put a new borderlands game in your title i think it's if i do that why are you clickbaiting for this isn't a new board landscape those people will come out then is this borderlands massive six packs we i mean this feels so destiny now what you said though you know this game probably inspired destiny definitely no question the one thing i do miss is that borderlands 3 had like a bunch of different vehicle types and there's not many in this like you don't really have quite limited in terms of open this spaces be over before you can regret it i am the curator of the shrine of the goddesses shrine of the goddesses i'm playing the game within the game mummy style arena okay you've seen brendan fraser's the mummy yeah yes the scene from that movie how dare you even joke about such things now if you're quite through with jackie's everything about going back to star wars battlefront 2 it's still super active i mean maybe a couple videos i'd like to try the mods out since some of you guys popularity quite a bit yeah like russian badger did a video where the mods were just insane yeah that looks like a lot well after 2042's downfall i think a lot of people want to try back tried uh the game since it's got a lot of content and it's in a good spot now yeah leaping but what shall i say finally a quest for you oh god here we go oh [ __ ] no you had to do it that time i just what i actually didn't see it though where am i supposed to land just all the way through this is sick congratulations sounds like a wonderful night realm but my curiosity overcame my judgment how do we get across the history so nice nice pleased by the sheer power of the first busy years he was out before borderlands i don't think it was his mind both lines came out well before destiny oh god i missed he called me a young a strange a youtube strange man as well what was that delilah he called you a youtube strange man yeah after leaving that comment for the world oh you're right this was like way before yesterday that's very strange um we have to get across there you're a youtube strange man i'm a youtube stranger that fire is upside down oh there's a jump pad there that's funny yeah yeah that's why i landed on that one and then i i fell down a level oh i think i've done it okay i'm over yeah you youtube proceed oh she probably gonna i will fondly oh there we go oh we've got a fight on our hands i like how when i reload and it throws them it actually explodes if it hits them yeah that happens with my dragons so good it's time to deactivate the locks up above and that is if you can figure out your back can you figure out we'll tell you exactly how to do it with these blue diamonds i mean there is a version of the game where you don't get the tips oh i fell through again oh for god's sake into the nether room i fell in that black hole and fell all the way through what have you done oh no she's angry tom i'm gonna need you here to fight come back come back oh she's not angry she won't be there oh spreading pressure why'd you teabag everything so lisa's mind has taken care of an easter egg and i've got this i've got achievement unlocked that's a shame she's going to listen now yeah is this the new time crisis oh time i'll tell you what if i had a big enough house and i had a room across the socket machine yes and uh silent scope and tommy would come over every night yeah i'd have to get the ninja ninja turtles game you can join if you want you can actually join i love that you my mind catch us if you can i've got a legendary shield thank you for reminding me she seems so innocent in your description okay playing with it don't let her out of your sight the prophecy says and four inches this is a delight i can't wait to kill this puzzle why would you say that i don't know i feel like she's up to leaving are youtubers he's probably just help us [Laughter] wow that's fun i don't know tom there's just something funny about it yeah yeah this game reminds me of borderlands borderlands was you know obviously that caught they just copied destiny yeah so i don't think gaming was around until destiny no way no way everyone knows that destiny 1 was the origin of gaming pretty cool graphics as well considering it was the first ever game yeah it looks like borderlands are you pulling out some damage now what was that yeah uh it's just my reload thing i do have a weird like crossbow that doesn't do any damage whatsoever though like no no stats come up when i shoot people and they don't die this is pretty messed up right here this is it's a witcher reference because they do that in the wood chart and yennefer have sex on a unicorn what's your reference girl goes um my inventory i wrote this in the script okay ready i'm waiting for the manic laugh in three two one how did you know tom i told you just write the script didn't i dude i didn't know you didn't tell me you were not about to vanish before our very eyes wow that's a [ __ ] what color is the like button click it and find yeah it's all your fault all right like this it is said that in order to retrieve the key to enter jumping and running at the same time no i know about that jumping and running at the same time that's what the news [Music] and i forgot to repeat even the prophecy doesn't know where the ancient keystone is gone i think you can add aoe to its savage stain but it's part of the skills maybe for which for a weapon or this thing it's got a little bit of aoe it's got freeze on it there's a couple of different variants of like i can do like a hammer slam or i can do the hammer throw which obviously i prefer uh matthew thank you for the 10 man that's very kindly see i'll do the hammer slam now in three seconds and demonstration that's cool i prefer the throw because it makes me feel like full tuna crazy that this is a side quest top is it yeah it's not it's not main quest after killing that bastard yeah stupid wasted if by some vehicle you survive find the vitals so the long-lost keystone i don't know if there's any other cool like voice actor voice actors watch out for the pants have power you picked up idiot [ __ ] ouch yeah i guess they do yes [Music] you inside a bubble like it traps you in there if you're not fast enough this has been one of the coolest levels in terms of just like fighting things yeah yeah so what i mean though as well like the the like next part of the game being so much better than the first there's a wind trap here jack but it's in the corner side of it i don't know what it is a wind truck okay sorry oh stop now oh god it's back where was i oh just seemed to blow as soon as i jumped yeah the wind will stop in a second oh as soon as i jumped inside again i got it i got it what oh my god we'll just see about that they killed you yep oh god i need tina will likely end up in fortnight soon yeah maybe drop me a load of weapons to keep me down you just have to jump when the wind ends yeah you gotta be quick though as soon as it stops jump yeah just jump on it i literally went as soon as it stopped it blew me a little bit but like i grabbed the thing at the very end go go there you go i'm gonna have to like drop some stuff some because yeah my mind i'm pretty [Music] goodbye it's so weird when you st the umbrella stuff out i'm striking that look good that blue thing oh watch me it's gonna drop some stuff you ready you're watching yeah i'm watching it doesn't blow it that's a shame oh i saved my oh no [ __ ] whoa oh there's a thing over there as well that works wait where are they you just run through it's behind me or in front i forward just forward yeah there's a there's like a purple orb on the right side look what's that what did you see yeah we need to grab it bordeaux rocket the rat scallion of crankiness that's called simply must grab it i'm simply blown away yes smash all lost marbles give me some clothes i can't wait to put them on i can't wait to die i can't wait to die can anyone say what is the mission or who is the main boss the main boss is the dragon lord played by willard yeah obviously we will complete our bond and become extraordinary beyond compare [Music] oh my goodness what's the bar about it yeah it's got like an invisibility thing survived i'm actually shocked but all right ah look he's invisible [Music] what [Music] this way like your voice for asana by the way it's very easy i'd have to record all the places in the world though wouldn't i i ain't got time for that oh no you know they've got the technology now like right they can create an automated voice the ai yeah based on your pitch yeah the ai voices like they did for um yeah did you see that episode where they talked about the ai voice yeah watch a lot of those i videos i'll give you the honor of an epic ar that i cannot afford hear me when i say this maybe i can sell more stuff yeah yeah yeah you just like running off and abandoning me again no i'm at the shop next to you it's okay tom it's okay i won't leave you again thanks i'll leave you again yeah can i buy that now yes i can do i want it does 71 damage what do i have right now the 70 that does 18. that does 69 a lull indoor feed thank you for 20 months man that's a lot of months yeah more than 19. it is a lot you think about this why wasn't this a dlc for borderlands 3 i think it's just because of the amount of content in it tyrese like yeah there's there's a lot here it's basically borderlands 4 but based around one character yeah um the gameplay is very similar to borderlands 3 though uh except the spells and like more melee stuff ultimate abilities and fun things oh my god i love this ar this is amazing that sounds cool it's got like a level on the it's right if i shoot really well i'll drop that's your gun there you go a lot of recall on it it's nice though it's less when you're abs are you you like crank it that's sweet dude handling right so it's pretty cool drops yeah that's sweet dude never drops again that's mine and it's mine now sandy to the back yeah i was thinking about this earlier like um think about this a lot a lot of people uh well not a lot of people a few people in my chat uh on the first day especially were like um god the graphics don't look that much better than borderlands 3 and i was thinking well i guess the cell shaded style yeah they do though that's the thing if you put them side by side yeah definitely especially the um like the environments and the lighting um but i was thinking like shadows too like they're like if you come over here look like see your own shadows you didn't have this in in borderlands 3. kind of dynamic lighting yeah like it's not i mean there's dls in this game i've got vsf's even i was thinking four months is way better than borderlands 3. they've got to be working on a like a borderlands 4 or whatever right yeah i think they've probably made this alongside it and a lot of the enemies and stuff you've seen we'll be there too but probably want to they probably want to do a new engine yeah i'm real engine it'll be ue5 and it'll look insane if you think yeah because some people were like well how how do you improve on this because it's just cell showing but if you think if like they could do much higher quality character models the lighting they could have real-time reflections the shadows well they've had mods in the past i'm pretty sure that removed the outline and i think if you do that then it looks a lot more real like the bass graphics hold up on their own anyway yeah but it's a it's a stylistic choice that works i think a lot of people like it it stands the game apart too like if it didn't have the outlines it would just be destiny makes it more unique return to the temple i think the most like cartoony aspect is the characters themselves like with the way that they have like lines on their faces and stuff what the hell i think we have to go up tom okay oh i love this ale this is sick but at least i had time to drink my potions and oil my blood stephen fries are you now we head to the rooftop where the shattering which is performed i mean the animation qualities will all be improved on the new engine you would hope hear me wicked solicitor it is i the undefeated monster slayer garrett of trivia graphics are going to start getting insane though like with with you yeah the next couple of years is going to be absolutely nuts people uh building games for next year only now as well no it weren't before true yeah taking advantage of the ps5 and series x wow that was the

keeping salisa from getting all our big bad powers back and drowning the world or whatever not particularly no that's teenager baby they're green now so that means they're friendly oh yeah celebrate celebrate we are thank you for the corrupting influence of was evil even many of our sisters will still be going to check out for spoken yeah definitely you've seen that game for spoken yeah i don't know it's a dumb name but the game looks cool lady like out in the desert on youtube it's not exactly tiny tina's tina turner's wonderland cool mission what level y'all know oh i'm going up uh almost 18. oh god don't go up that i'm not a fan of that gun [Music] [Laughter] nicholas has broken his cauldron 22. i think we should do this one pets rest because that's like level 23 mr lazy eye thank you for the two man that's very kind hey jack i see you like the tiny things wonderland yeah it's good fun uh we've been that way yeah we have to teleport i think yeah oh yeah it's uh to the right go over there around here i think we should we can just go back to the um the main hub the overworld uh all right yeah this is the land of the stakes snakes nichelle where is it down there okay how do we get down there thomas is that a shortcut there what do you mean look at look at them see the blue diamond yeah i've got to get there let's go there then you know you can walk in this game jack yeah but i'm just saying if there's anything we can fast travel to yeah but let's walk because in that time we'll probably get there okay let's walk there tom let's walk there jack i've got an idea yeah let's walk there okay [Music] just up top my head that was there's a dice here oh did you get attacked nope i didn't hear that i picked up a die awfully maybe it had a secret enemy that popped out of it maybe oh my god hello these are new cyclops oh yeah it distracts the enemies yeah it spawns its own gun that also shoots whilst you're shooting okay it's the ball i okay um that's what you mean now that i'm here how do we go how do we get down there should we go to bright hoof how can you drop down no you've taken a full damage try be careful though as you go off the edge try and land on the sphere that's above me okay you can see where i am you can look across the edge and see this here how did it come to be divided into continents and painted with diversity yeah what complex tectonic mechanics are occurring even now nice well done jack are you sponsored by another oh just a pretty face oh yeah matthew don't worry about it dude it's cool cranberry hang on we were just friends with these are we fighting um them mean not these ones particularly these ones go to hell for okay yeah screw them this game needs more particle effects yeah it needs way more i want to not be able to see a thing remember this you caught any new ready or not contact i think the new update just came out of the new hotel map which looks really cool well not a hotel it's like a villa oh lord now as well so you can't just like obviously see they've got a weapon but a gun by their hands yeah it's a bit more on your toes or you'll get a knife to the jugular did the die roller one are you a critical fail is that why i look see there you go that's why we were pulled into that encounter before apparently oh that's cool she got unlucky yeah makes sense i don't know what you're fighting [Music] oh that massive thunder giant shot you know the giant sharks yeah i can see oh the giant sharks yeah you see the um yeah the giant dogs yeah trying sharks that's a cool looking cave he's a big boy [Music] a oh giant shot in that chest in that chest where's the chest do you see a dress yes here it is there it is crabby oh truly this world is a wonder hey cody what's up man good to see you would you ever do streaming setting vid your streams are nice mr lazy eye do you mean like my setup is that what you mean hey jack oh spawned nice [Music] your loot lock has increased i didn't know it span like that though yeah so we could get worse luck it doesn't really explain that no well it did on the left then it literally just explained it i mean like before thank you yeah you know in the game yeah hit these dice and then they roll a one you can uh i don't know like tutorial videos like that don't do very well on youtube but i might do it one day my setup is very simple though maybe you could do it in a um when you do a gaming setup video briefly touch on it [Music] it's cool the streams look nice though mr lazy eye because the bit rate that's it basically youtube lets you stream at higher bit rates and resolutions compared to other streaming platforms so that's why they look nice you know i've got the hardware and the internet connection to do that it's that simple a shrine piece catches your sweet jackave oh my god i just went on some jump pads and oh i can't get to it though yeah that guy gave us the power to get rid of those let's go rolling the dice seven three well that's the main quest i'm 25 now what are you doing [Music] ah let's see you'll kill him way more enemies than me though it's taking me a longer time to kill him let's see how it goes so i think this might be the final area i don't want to do this tomorrow hopefully it scales it for me it looks way better than twitch jessica yeah it should do because i mean the bit rate is literally like seven eight times higher yeah you can literally stream like six pivot rate on twitch 1080p every mountain i think yeah they're held together by the imagination but it also has more issues though when you stream it okay yeah it doesn't give you the transcoding options yeah i'm gonna take this madhouse prison this wonderlands and i'm gonna free us all from her control the wastard said the pyramid is surrounded by a city of the dead we'll have to then go stream at 12 on youtube 440p revolver hello that rocket launch is still really good what mode is this this is just the the main game i did yeah how's the game so far it's good fun josh i have a 3 700 x and a 30a and it still looks like poop i'll try just my bitrate if you're streaming on youtube yeah if you've got the internet connection to handle it you should use nvinc as well don't use cpu encoding see you later michelle 2 a.m in sri lanka got to go to bed because lots of spooky things happen at three after three a.m interesting interesting oh i just sold an exotic thing and i have to buy a bike [Music] oh damn i must have done it earlier so i'll never get it back even more pain pain pain it's all pain all pain all the time pain why do we live just to suffer pain where do we live oh i've got a big hefty revolver here insane dude look it's like a wingman it looks like it looks like a wingman yeah whoa we just said the same thing did you write this did you write me no i wrote i wrote the script for your life for me okay cool for you i'm done with it you're welcome wow we just bunny hops at the same time you script though i'm not the fate maker seeks the power necessary to emerge triumphant oh i know you're gonna do that these aren't that tough but who knows they're level 21 for me so there are a few levels out but i can kill them 25 um i don't i think i mean this feels like the end game main mission doesn't it i don't know i mean it's a lot of enemies but surely you should say like this is your last chance to a great day yeah

can see more adventurous skin types oh yeah there is a lizard on there you can make sure yeah it's a lot of customization really like it [Music] that's me after two years of lockdown [Music] there's so much customization in the game where you can't see yourself i suppose it's just yourself yeah the emotes and when you do um your ultimate abilities you're going to third person quite often where's

goblin in a barrel this guy's a barrel like snake no i'll teleport something it's just ah it's attacking us what do you want me to do jack you teleport right now right now dude i'm gonna ground you i don't know where you want to be grounded and the suffering at least you know how do i just do it though without a terminal or do we need to find a terminal you can just teleport to me look at the map um there's a station there you can click on it teleport to me not without a terminal thing though no no you don't need that you just go we've got to go cleanse the well tunnel well jack [Music] i call this one the tilt world your pet just did a backflip it does that sometimes i tilt well say hold on holding i'm holding oh yes yes just as we practiced tangle drift fully stopped find the temple of

there's the influence i've completed our quest are the influences you see on that where i'm going yeah is this the right way yeah okay hey nipple heart what's up ethan we've got one more code to give

there we go get in there hello ethan what's up they defiled the temple thomas please throw a knife at me oh i reckon we can get started on tomorrow for the last mission um can we maybe get you to join tomorrow for the last mission yeah i got about four inches that's not what we are well it doesn't make sense right the context of the question he's gone he just joined him why is he never straight with us i don't know it's hard being friends with him honestly yeah sometimes pushing you to the limit you know [Music] don't do warning shots not me that's what my guy said he's like waves of light the shotgun fires cool um so from my lightning shotgun might be another room hmm perhaps this is so weird with third person oh you mean the top down for you yeah it's just part of the game it's like the dnd it's like uh yeah it's like a dnd like piece there's a dungeon dragon backstory i forget what they call it in this game but that's like your move i guess you fight stuff along the way it's called the overworld as well would you believe it it's a dog fish fish it's a dog fish jack it's not fast offensive for goldfishes i mean look at the name this one's called titan tooth but [Music] got him guns lots of guns yeah it is good fun the bait they're sold by animation yeah that's good what's the name the game devs just put it there to troll so you can't ever i mean kind of get it yeah you just walk next to it and a bridge appears i've got it it's real i've just grabbed it at this very moment i can't get it though i've just crossed the bridge yes okay well then it's about learning thanks what's up don how you i feel the warmth of the gods in my heart thank you hero i must hang this in my guest bathroom so that all may feel its glory didn't guess but okay okay okay no quest too small i got a load of achievements there what the hell all right why humble brag yes i'm nearly at the bottom of my skill tree here ah this away an upturned bridge stands before you awaiting your mighty house [Music] the navy rushed to secure the new sea only to find the pirates were now insistent that there were twelve seas all told and so the game of worgen hair has continued for centuries wait that's the main question of sea stretch on the pirates you ask and how much soda they've had that day that one we've got to go back up whatever one you've just selected we've got to go back up yeah that's the one i want to go to okay so come back down the way you came you pick there's this which is cooperative where loot is uh specific to you and no one else can take it and your level scales so it's easy for both players or there's co-opetative where the loot that drops you have to fight for fight over and levels don't scale you'd obviously level up faster if the host has a higher level you'll be fighting the host levels enemies but for me and jack i'm a lower level than him so i'm fighting lower level enemies which is good there you go i appreciate it as a lower level player you said lower level again uh lower level it's very good yeah i got about four inches i didn't say that about that game over i said lower level star just leave discord if you're not going to join okay it's just it's really really annoying enough four inches was like nowhere in that sentence how do i get this how about this you've got some sort of boost how about that where are you where are you by the way oh you stood there sorry i was at the shopping that's all right how'd you get what this there's a thing uh drop down from the waterfall maybe like up there see that i'm gonna try and jump it

puppet this is the last sword i forged for you what the hell is in this game you hear that i heard a ghostly voice don't know what he said what are you saying [Music] long ago it sounds like an interesting question i cannot say though it fills me with dread i recognize this path as though i traveled it not long ago come let us see where it leads this way are you coming tom yeah i'm right behind you what am i looking at though are you oh right behind you it was just uh what he was saying was interesting what did he say it was like a weird ghostly voice oh i heard i just didn't know

was the call of duty advanced warfare trailer modern warfare 2 dude that did have a lot of dislikes yeah and the battlefield now is when battlefield 1 came out like the first trailer for that and then advanced warfare came out alongside it so it's like the most light game trailer and the most disliked game trailer that was a weird year for games 2016. imagine if it was 2042 when the game was

now his face that's nice and i shall grant you this wow so i am no friend of dragon kind i cannot abide but strange circumstance you will be free you gotta go free the dragon watch out for the fire son where did you make him go tom where did you go there was literally a green door next to it i was trying to go through the watch that's a reference to the first sheep that was cloned because the name is dolly yes oh carry on jack carry on carry away yeah just keep keep going teleported but oh i'm here now find the release mechanism uh we need to find the release mechanism it's probably down here let's see if we can find it on um oh it's here right surely outside do this look oh flip i think i destroyed it as i died no you didn't it's outside somewhere that was a plant that was sure i had a plan it killed a sheep we have to go over here it's sean the sheep it's sean the sheep i don't know i think i've gone the my way son oh for god's sake what do i always commit i don't know where i'm going from oh you never do listen we i think we were in the right place oh my gosh let's come back to where we were i don't know how you get down there though tom you know it's showing the sheep it's showing the sheep even mucks about with those that cannot bleat so we have to follow dolly look there's like a plant behind where the dragon is you see ain't a plan and i shot it and i died you see the plan oh yeah and then it rev almost fell off again ratio and then it reveals something and then it grows back so you've got to try and be quick oh i see what you're saying oh get in there okay maybe that's not the thing because it doesn't actually do anything i don't know where to go so i have to be honest now where do we go now i've fallen off again i'm just losing money like so much money maybe it is outside i think it is outside tom follow me this way we come back the release mechanism kill his ass i mean he's not he's looking to us we've rinsed him we've rinsed him oh my god get
