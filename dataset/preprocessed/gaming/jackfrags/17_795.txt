a long time ago in a galaxy far far away some genius had the bright idea of inventing a game mode called gun game and this started in counter-strike and you know what it was Jack's favorite game mode and they've just added it to modern warfare so we are going to play a load of this enjoy I'm not sure how gun game works in modern warfare like is it always a round and set of guns I'd be cool does it give you the same as every time I'm not sure they're gonna see the laser sights that are they if you're aiming how that was rude he just got shot in the back there we go I'll take that onto a shotgun not a big fan of this one still man he nearly got me I'm gonna chill here for a sec felt like a bison is in there I need to be super cautious when I'm aiming because like I said like everyone is gonna see that and they'll give me away like crazy someone up there oh he got deleted might still be here I mean I was doing it for the meme vert see ya mp5s d nice stick around these houses I like it not much range on the mp5 sir I mean I couldn't turn quick enough is that ek unfortunate ng o mine run into that I kind of scared me to be honest rocket launcher well made light work of that could be someone up on my left need to get it closer early with this good night I can't tell you how much I love this game mode so much fun right here got him foul love that should we peek here it's not an enemy no though p90 gonna move gotta get in close again now different angle behind me how did I survive then someone here sniper rifle who's never gonna get that one I don't really want to be moving up close here see if anyone runs down here I am one point in the lead currently good way for someone to come down the stairs or come on I'm gonna have to get killed somewhere all right I think he had a rocket launcher never he was reloading it 3 5 7 please don't war bang me he's just waiting for me isn't it so I can get him I hope that was he killed I don't know he stopped peeking maybe he was killed guys right last weapon you got to get throwing knife kill rather than a melee kill should be easy just gotta get them to walk into it like that oh man I absolutely love this game mode it's so good so much fun now we get to see Emporia slow motion whoo Shh yes right next game oh this games already started just put me in a game they'd already begun dudes on five kills right I've got some catching up to do lads can we do it are they in the building yeah they are they're on seven now and go close range yeah come in walk in well that was lucky pause that don't know if they can actually can they jump up here they can right got in car 98 with a suppressor love that Oh beautiful got the newsy please don't kill me don't push don't push ah no I thought you were dead I thought you'd been killed my friend maybe it might be someone in there now someone's taken my spot oh he's right here I thought they were behind me no way how did you pull that off alright that was close rocket launcher please I hear someone I'm not right here somewhere where did they go he's still alive I don't know [Music] yes I'm the trouble time on that is insane I'm a little smug no shot see rubber stick to the buildings again with this I think yep that's revenge the music it's my favorite spot here I think actually go on this side of the map scar fire slow but it's powerful okay so just write in to me dude I knew you were there sniper missed it behind me I think come in walk in walk in need him to walk in behold user guy my left kitchen it's the worst place type of sniper got him yes oh my god it's the it's the pistol from the single-player with that weird suppressor on it how are you supposed to aim that look the suppressor actually covers the red dot how most people are gonna beat me here could have got a kill there if I was a bit more careful this ramp us damn it this is hard to get a girl with one ahead of me come back try to catch up I need this kill I think we did it yeah right knife kill can we get this second one it's prime just ready yes and you as well do you want some get in oh man it's so tense I love it it's great game oh it's so good shink it's a shame he didn't show the second one there well one more match I should make this like a regular thing just gun game so good I need to try the 1v1 gun fight -
