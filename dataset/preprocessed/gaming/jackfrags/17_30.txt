from check us for the 99 million give 100 million and then that's fine i'm gonna fire a torpedo ready yeah that's it is it away oh there it is look at that oh my god he's wiggling the petal away yeah i passed out i passed out it's okay don't worry we're going to be all right go to a different turret splash three targeted get in please boom slash four okay this guy's getting it oh baby splash five wait we have to take our helmets off yeah you do yeah all right so we're basically we're waiting for tommy oh it's delicious jack don't eat the ice cream just by chomping it down with your teeth dude this is the this is the way they do it on this planet let's go it's gone no one can eat a corn now that quickly that's the full tooth smasher that would be so cold ride the torpedo do you see it i'll give it a go i don't think you can actually ride the torpedo i mean i'll give it a go has anyone ever tried well oh for [ __ ] sake can you load another one okay that's good at it i could maybe get on that come on okay bog is on it oh my god get on it get on it jack get on it oh my god okay firing in three oh no two one oh my god well i'm gonna die no superhero landed incapacitated how do i fold out the wings on this extra probably end oh baby that is sick i don't think that'll be dmca will it go above you like we can look up like top gun yeah go on why not you have to turn upside down there don't you oh no well that sounds risky it's fine all right this is fine this is how you get a good look at the russian mig-29 [Music] how close can i get to you do you think if the hitboxes are correct you could put your wing in between my wing look at that you're nearly there that sounds like it could be like that sound a good idea if you get it level yeah up a little bit that's it that's it oh that's that's nearly touching oh i god i'm in a spin of doom i blacked out oh my god look at this look at the target oh my god he's not gonna recover from that i'm back i'm back it stops spinning it's fine i've got control there there you are that's very odd oh yeah you can actually see the pilot as well touching with touching noses i don't know if that's a good idea that's how the x-wings make a baby i've got one of them that's the main guy yeah but dorsey's here look what of dorsey stephen strange ow i think i hit you then he's gone and he did that's cool it's pvp you firing missiles he hasn't got missiles in a prowler i'm hitting him power to weapons i always get my man oh jack what the hell that's one way of dealing with him jack mission complete this is so cool the formation lads that's good like the keys it looks like uh lila was all right start your content drive and spill it up towards everest then hang on we're doing it is everyone going i've got three i can see three in the quantum i see three people and i've got my job in front of me oh yeah i see you johnny you're on my right behind me [Music] some nice fireworks there feel like i'm back at the magic kingdom but it's in space can we please go and take a look at the javelin have you been on the javelin jack no ah let's go on the javelin i've got a fact sheet i'll read off that what have you got a fact sheet well you've got experience at showing people around houses that much different yeah you'll be good you're the ship estate agent you've got to sell the ship to us all right well oh god well you used to be an estate agent so you can make it work oh it's easy with the it's five million pounds here's the bug well did you sell a house to tom hardy at one point well i've shown tom hardy you're showing him around the house i didn't know it was tom hardy at the time obviously what he had a cap in it michael from halloween mask was it no no he had a cap and sunglasses on it's like captain america in the avengers i'm just running this scenario through my head that will he's got tommardi and his his wife but he's come in come in this is the dog what do you think this is a bargain it's five mil take it and leave it well no no his wife was doing most of the speaking when i registered them i honestly never crossed my mind that he was playing did they buy the house no i know where they live though oh wow [Laughter] oh my god so is this ship smaller than the bengal or bigger yes it's a lot smaller okay but it's still a capital ship are you ready to show us around well right i'm your tour guide guys oh nice to pajamas as well what's more i know i'm freaking stolen at me i told you i did right so this javelin is 480 meters long it's sold by the military is it surplus right here you can see one of the manned ata turrets consisting of two size 8 guns that woman just flowing through the roof okay carry on no selfies oh my god it looks like something out of like warhammer 4 okay there's something here this is deck b so it's probably a midday yeah you're a terrible estate agent this is shower room don't pick up the soap okay why not well i'll get you i'll get i'll get you well there's multiple uh sleeping quarters it can hold up to uh what did i say before so the briefing rumor here is in the middle oh what is the hologram in the middle yeah hologram what plenty of seating for all the officers oh johnny's in there johnny's already found it there you go we can all sit down look it has been an active service since 28 30. wow look at this you didn't tell us the name of the [ __ ] by the way remember it's warhammer apparently he actually is a warhammer ship jack really that's what it reminded me of yeah it's called the uee warhammer okay the warhammer saw action during the fall of caliban in 2884. right man we've got a mission i don't know what it is yet but just look at the hologram behind me what's the objective sir our mission is to take the scorpius we need to attack the bengal with forces you listening over there yeah yeah good we need to take this bengal with force i can see you smiling there tommy i don't appreciate that this is a serious assignment we'll take the scorpius in a squadron fee formation we will view the main turret and we will stay close to the ship to avoid the tracking of the turret and then we'll probably die what's the life expectancy of this mission sir well as you are new recruits look around you 84. you're all that's left oh no excuse me sir excuse me where's the boss not appropriate you are an officer okay we understand the mission we get the mission i could go prone i guess jesus christ that bed's massive look at my arms that looks insane when you're doing that [Laughter] it's very strange that is very very odd oh my god i don't like i don't know if that happened yeah let's have a look there is it oh my god the absolute chungus is it lit up or is it yeah it's lit for me so this is the biggest ship in the game i think at the moment 990 meters double the length of the javelin it's an absolute chungus look at this gun on the bottom jack that's a big shot by that the gun on the bottom wait isn't that that gun is bigger than the hammerhead doesn't it it's 240 meters it's bigger than that 890 jump it's the same size as the idris where are we starting our attack run from then jack i mean we should go from the front right so everyone go to the front and then we'll attack it uh may i recommend putting your shields to maximum okay man in less than a minute aircraft from hill will join others from around the world and you'll be launching the largest aerial battle in history of mankind he giggled this mankind no i just know it off by heart okay star citizen that word should have a new meaning for all of us today we can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore we will not vanish without a fight today we celebrate our independence uh it's firing its main candidate uribe attack [Music] oh no collision this isn't looking good come on get it get it i'm gonna control the spin control the spin i'm being hammered right now ah your turrets that's it take out the main weapon yeah that's nice [Music] well johnny and um adam are gonna rent the ships that can drop the nukes yeah and then we're gonna go to a planet and drop some nukes on it just to see what it looks like yeah just to see what happens you know oh okay you can see the nukes oh you can see the needle right say hello to my little friend those are the nukes i thought that was part of the ship i mean it's got the word ordinance written on it jack is mob mother of bombs yeah come in here let's look at them there oh right now they are volatile inside the ship as well so i wouldn't recommend firing anything towards them okay if you're flying and you drop it and leave that ramp open i'll see out the back won't i that's what i was thinking do that then well we've got four see we're down here now okay adam you see that mountain yeah drop it on that mountain yeah that's what i was thinking i don't like that mountain have you targeted it because it looks like you're above me yeah i think i'm fine i think you guys are about to die you ready i'm ready yeah tell me when you're gonna drop it three two one dropping i don't see it did you aim at the mountain yeah it it it is actually going straight down well that's going to land on me and kill me yeah i can see it falling it's like a little triangular icon jack i can see adam run constantly drop it on the mountain that was like a mile away and he dropped it on my head will please only one of your legs is on there will you're going to blow it up no no that wasn't no i've ran away you definitely need to turn that round and land it the other way yeah my legs are nearly there not quite well it's close isn't it it's close yeah if you put it down now but the thing is your your ass might hit johnny's maybe put it down now put it down there all right power off it's dropped oh god oh god oh god oh my god no it's okay no no you might want to save it adam's crotch is reviving me thank you i've gone off the ramp a bit there what is that well this is the georgia this is the aaa oh oh you got a tank as well yeah tank and this is the the ballista which is like anti-aircraft basically are you going on foot jack yeah i just want to see the nuclear explosion that's all rather than being in it let us know when you've dropped it adam i've dropped it i don't see it it's dropped on top of the a9 jumper all dead i hope not oh [ __ ] look at the debris flying out as well that's cool um i'll do some damage to his [ __ ] when he blacked out pulling out that as well he was escaping like a bloody rally car or something did that in the sky it was a bit of a mad turn that you're gonna drive out somewhere within your tank i'll try and nuke you nice and far away from the rest of the stuff yes yes that's the main thing it's not very fast though i don't feel like i've got much chance yeah we need to be further away and a bit higher up oh are you loading a new top yeah that looks sick i actually did an animation you're going for itself yeah okay will it be right or left it's allowed oh no what have you done it what it just glitched me out the ramp jack jack now i don't worry we're at fallout said jack well i'll get a good view i guess i survived just chipped me upside down why can you not buy parachutes by the way finish him no don't finish me off did you fall off i'm currently free falling in the sky i'm going to catch you don't worry you've got about three seconds i'm not gonna go i mean we know what ramps do hey i'm perfectly still oh that looks so stupid i'm just sliding along the ice wait wait wait okay i'm getting out i've got no control of my character it's just it won't let me do it enough okay you got me got me thank you all right are we ready for a bombing run i'm just loading a nuke nuclear missile loading oh there's two there's some three two one go i've changed direction i don't know and he's gonna marvel oh no remake i've got stuck on a rock oh no go go one nuke when did the other one go oh it's so stormy down here there's the other one there's one yeah oh no no wow oh okay i'm dead i got this guys that was a direct hit do they work in space well oh you can't nuke in space why not if you fly directly above the bengal and drop the nuclear bomb out why not be sure i don't just stumble out the bomb it's armed yeah if you shoot it with a laser will it go off yeah that'll work really no yes yeah that'll work i think i've got a good view here tom i'm not really sure how this is gonna work i'm gonna i'm gonna fly above it and then drop you dropping it oh [ __ ] tom oh [ __ ] spinning yeah it didn't drop there was no dropping there no it doesn't ah it just says no gravity you get an error saying no gravity well so you literally can't drop it oh you can't do it that's a shame there is gravity down on laurelville newt lawville oh yeah why not what's nuke remag why are you so obsessed all right where the [ __ ] are you i'm coming i'm coming for you now if you want to joust come on then my finesse is too much for you [Music] how you hit me nuclear bomb bomb launched oh i can see it i'm gonna shoot it watch out don't shoot the nuclear bomb will please i'm shooting it oh my god did you hit it yeah it's cute playing up it's blue yeah got me an adam oh no oh my god as if you could do that that's the fastest ship in the game i think so in atmosphere anyway because obviously in space they all kind of get it's just a giant engine on a cockpit i guess it is yeah it's just a massive engine absolutely blitzes it through the atmosphere what that was quick man [Music] look at those thrusters on the back it is fast i didn't know that yeah that's cool jack those animations need a bit of work [Music] you can just go bing spinning first of all it's got an extra remote turret on the back there you can see yeah oh baby the gatling gun is it yeah it's not just got one gatling on there jack have a look at this okay there's two on that side and then there's two on this side as well absolutely mad lad [ __ ] this is why do you need that many gatling guns hurston is seeking a contractor willing to clear out scavengers from a cave on aberdeen can only be accessed on foot the site has been used to launch a number of aggressive attacks against hurston's interests and personnel so it's imperative that these actions stop you authorizers take any action necessary payment will be sent once the facility is confirmed to be clear what do you think i mean eviction for me that's a bullet in the head yeah is this the cave i think so it's really difficult to make out anything here to be honest oh here we go what's all that stuff that's come up minerals yeah yeah that's definitely it uh we're gonna get austin i've got my weapon ready i'm gonna look let's go test it are you oh my god i like it so in this cave is just shoot outside oh yeah pop one in oh my god are you opening up with grenades are you it's very dangerous now you stay here steal oh my god i've jumped in it's low gravity right knock knock all right here we go um i don't like the echoes what the point with the grenade launcher don't worry that thing's just gonna annihilate everyone oh hello oh there might be some more men over there yeah yes oh you just hit him square in the face is there one on the oh no is he dead yeah he's dead yes tom it's fine yes keep firing i'm sat through their pockets look if you click loot yeah i'll click loot on him and then right click his um core and his legs and click open it adds more inventory down the bottom and no way what we want is the mid the sweet sweet minerals they were mining what's the minerals called is it dollar vine dollar vine and had a knight once further into the cave we go it's so echoey very echo horrible oh yeah this way see the boxes the they kind of show you where you got to go and the blue flowers as well right oh god drop them guys i like those effects on their chest armor all right we want to go we want a tumbling instant here we're going to be careful the holes you can fall down yep oh there's wait this way there's a evidence of life i don't fall probably down here somewhere there's six more times here phil don't run before down a giant chasm now there's a light up ahead going dark oh yeah i see it damn jack i want to engage enemy down vaporize him there's men coming jack i'll kill them they go i'll do the job you get them yeah there's more men coming got him two left tom i'm going to jump across what open out let's go one left below us to the left somewhere you hear a footstep yeah i know that wasn't you i thought that was actually you don't see him he's lagging it you get him we've cleared the cave nice good job that's a cool mission never done that before that all the stuff a very dramatic death there from that guy with his torch shining the light into the sky look at that dumb oh the ragdolls have physics afterwards well let's test get back dunk him oh that doesn't move him he didn't know what if we become we gotta get out of here no murderous cave creatures that's a shame we're just going about the way we came to be a little alien that ruins you what are these things on the floor then i don't know a moshi plague you just grab it doesn't sound good i don't well i'm not touching that it's called a plague jack look i've got it here do you want something it'll infect you no it's how the flood started yeah we're out i said that was quite the successful cave dwelling mission there well yeah we've got 15 grand each for that and then obviously the mineral sales as well will up the reward locate jamie preston neutralize jamie preston tom i think he's going to get hot grenadine don't you i mean most likely jamie preston's got crimes against the corporation that's unacceptable we can't have it he's believed to be recently located at a cave on aberdeen closing in on him here tom he's in a cave again but hopefully we'll see what type of game is it may well be the same type of game let's see i'll wait for you so this is the same planet but because we're on the other side the sun's here yeah i think the cave layout may be well they're not all the same but i know this is different that's a mining laser then i believe so i believe mine this look at that you just hold mouse on to do that or is there anything else to it well you you scroll up the power use mouse scroll to power up the laser it's 100 then there's like an area uh you've got to keep the power in so it gets to about the middle okay i'm in the i'm in the optimal power range so then you dial back the power a bit to keep it in the optimal power range it's molten tongue oh yeah it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna mulch almost there john they just stuck a microphone next to a kettle yeah oh there you go these little purple bricks you can pick up i don't know yeah yeah oh cool jamie preston jamie that's not jamie that pistol sounds cool man what the hell it's proper laser gun they're everywhere jack let's go jamie checking their bodies is that jake oh i saw a movement james is that you oh he's moving around he's back here tom i'm not going alone hey mate he's here tom there is take him out oh good job 1 500. that's not bad like i'm scared of the cave i want to leave well let's go we've done the mission we have to get out though now yeah exactly that's the scary part i would like it if there was horrible creatures that could spawn down here exactly that like on if you looked up and you could see them on the roof of the cave they're like staring at you with their eyes but eventually i think they do want like our other other human you know ai to kill than just humans so we're gonna crawl back down here and left it to start the beam and then mouse scroll up to like if there's like a power thing it says zero and it will go up to 100 on the left the right hand side of the you know the thing i have to keep putting up 200. there's like a line that's going up and you've got to keep it in the green zone so you spin up the power of the laser until it gets close to that and then spin it down when it if it goes into the red it'll just destroy it won't work okay we're in the green you just control it oh the kale's boiling tom the kettle's boiling i just have a dash of milk no sugar my builder has three sugars in his teeth no that's disgusting there we go hey yeah so that's my first mining tom tonka's my first mining yeah and then we've got had a night door just get them and store them grab them from the floor it's quite the desolate planet this isn't it not much here i like it though mando vibes with this ship and buku pissanto pisano you get it what's the objective neutralize did you get it yeah i got it yeah someone in this asteroid field i'm on right gun front where's the target there are many targets jack uh maybe coming up on the right now quite hard to get an angle up there why you're low uh he is should be right there coming up gonna get him you get it yeah he's dead but i softened him up quite a lot it's on two's here i'm gonna suffer them up explosion blew me back by the way when i killed that other one andrea de costa oh there he is he's right there the hell was that this guy here look he's gonna horn it it's difficult to know if he hit him i'll get on the turret uh power on okay all right here he is oh there's numbuku here we go not in range yeah he's a bit too far away oh my god that was close though oh he's loving that he's absolutely loving that dumb pass and missiles him missiles away that's missed ow he's got a lot of damage on his thumb is he spinning around me yeah get some hits on him there he was just spinning through space well done here we go training and shipping console so sal i've never even been in here dell from my backpack yeah 39 grand for the dolphin oh baby well thousand eight hundred and a hundred grand for the had a night i've got here what how much is mine forty two thousand i mean what did we do we did a couple of caves full of commissions yeah it's about yeah there's some good bounty hunting and and got lots of loot so i feel like a good day of the school [Music] [Music] [Music] you
