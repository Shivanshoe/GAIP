i can't believe i'm saying this they know if they max again guys i'm about to start wiling out and just tearing down some walls because it's my favorite gun in the game they've nerfed already i've left it again they've just changed the headshot multiplier from 1.62 to 1.5 unbelievable i might uninstall the game now just kidding but they just put out a patch that changed this stuff they've also adjusted the pharah a little bit and in regards to what we talked about yesterday and how they were going to fix solos well they've reduced the spawn rate of trucks massively in solo matches so now there's a very small amount of them in the match and by the end of the game you'd hope that people have actually shot them enough and took them out i haven't played a solo since the patch i need to test this but it's a massive nerf to the old big bertha and i think that it will improve the flow of the solar matches but anyways earlier today before the patch i got a couple games and some quads with westy study and tactical bit and i was using my number one gun the amax so this is before the nerf it's not much of a nerf but it is enough it just means that at long range other options will start to become more viable again and yeah that's not necessarily a bad thing but i just love this gun so much it's okay we'll have to make two for now but i did have an absolutely cracking game here with the amax quads can get quite sweaty at times as i'm sure you'll know but this was really fun we had good movement good beams nice bit of team play and it turned into a great action-packed match and cheers to all these lads and lasses for using my code in the cod store love you lots if you liked the video leave a like let's get into it now sit back relax can we get the victory let's see do
