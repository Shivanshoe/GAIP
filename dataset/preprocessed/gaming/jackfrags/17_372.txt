moments ago we got a brand new article about battlefield 6 and a brand new battlefield game that's being developed for mobile there's a ton of information in here this blog went up literally a couple minutes ago and i thought we'd dive in and take a look and this is presented by oscar gabrielson who is the gm at dice so hey battlefield community i know everyone is wanting more detail about what's coming for battlefield this year and i promise we have a lot to show you in the coming months we're putting some things together for when we reveal the next generation of battlefield and we can't wait to show that to you all but for now we have a couple things that we wanted to tell you about first we're really excited to have the biggest battlefield development team ever working on our console and pc game for this holiday season and second we have something very exciting to talk about on mobile so they've confirmed that the game is still releasing this holiday season end of october november would be my best guess there were some rumors and speculation that the game may have been delayed but as it turns out it's still at the moment coming out this year the return of all-out warfare we've heard that phrase before 2021 is an exciting time for us here at dice working with more world-class development studios within electronic arts we have our biggest team ever on a battlefield game for console and pc our friends at criterion and daisalya are working with us on our shared vision for the game while the team in gothenburg is taking technology in the game to the next level together we're creating a jaw dropping experience for you to enjoy later in 2021 now we've not heard about gothenburg working on this game before so that brings the total to four development studios working on the new main pc and console game which is pretty big and it falls in line with what oscar said earlier in that previous paragraph what those new technologies are we don't know yet but yeah i've always said this game is built for next gen so i imagine it's going to look incredible and have some pretty awesome gameplay mechanics it carries on we're in daily play testing mode right now polishing balancing and making the best possible battlefield game that we can i can tell you it is a bold step it has everything we love about battlefield and takes it all to the next level epic scale all out military warfare crazy unexpected moments game changing destruction massive battles packed with more players and mayhem than ever before all brought to life with the power of next gen consoles and pcs get ready for our reveal soon tm winky face so majorly hyping up this game right now of course they're going to hype their own game up right and i think the investors call is coming up next week or the week after something like that so we might get more information then but i mean they're really confident about how they're talking about this now and then a new battlefield mobile game coming in 2022 i don't think there's ever been a battlefield mobile game there's been companion apps before but we've never seen a proper game i guess it's always been our vision to bring battlefield to more platforms so after years of prototyping i'm super happy to be able to let you know that our friends at industrial toys working closely with all of us here at dice are developing a completely new battlefield game bringing all-out warfare to smartphones and tablets in 2022. make no mistake this is a standalone game a completely different game from the one that we're making for console and pc designed specifically for the mobile platform so it seems that this won't be just a port of the new game and it will instead be its own thing it's being built from the ground up by industrial toys to make battlefield on the go a reality and you can expect a fully fledged skill based experience this mobile game is now entering a testing period ahead of launching next year so expect more details to come i can't wait to show you the two battlefield games we have coming in the meantime stay safe and play some battlefield so a true battlefield experience is coming to mobile i guess that ea and dice maybe looked at the success of cod mobile what they're doing there and going you know what we could do that too or we kind of want a competitor in that space but the way they're talking about this it sounds like it could be first person massive amount of players and battlefield but just mobile we'll have to wait and see but there it is let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys pretty exciting news yeah we didn't see any trailers we didn't get the name of the new games not much detail here but there's a lot of hype obviously if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
