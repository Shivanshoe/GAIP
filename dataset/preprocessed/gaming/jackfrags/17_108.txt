if you're not playing hunt showdown you're missing out on some of the best most intense pvp on the market and many people think that this style of gameplay is the future of battle royale games it might not look exactly like this but the mix of choosing your loadouts before you drop in going up against diverse varied ai enemies as well as players extracting whenever you like with rare loot changing the perception of what winning looks like or in typical br fashion fighting till the last squad are components that games like call of duty warzone 2 will eventually adopt i reckon there's some truth to those rumors but of course only time will tell i've been playing hunt a fair bit during the start of 2022 and today i've got some mad highlights to show you from recent firefights that we've got into it gets really intense here and i hope you guys like this one if you do leave a like subscribe if you're new and let's see what all the fuss is about i'm gonna push in a bit and see if
