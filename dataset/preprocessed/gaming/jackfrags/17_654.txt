earlier this week we had a cheeky announcement of a new game from motive and EA called Star Wars squadrons at that time only a short cinematic trailer was shown with some further information available online but EA play has just brought us some real gameplay footage of PvP and single-player from a graphical standpoint the game looks fantastic and very immersive and now we've seen the gameplay and learn more we've got a deeper understanding of how this game will play just to bring people up to speed if you haven't seen this announcement Star Wars squadrons is a first-person team-based multiplayer and singleplayer game focused on the space combat experience and Star Wars set after the events of Return of the Jedi and the second Death Star being destroyed it's due for release in October this year on ps4 Xbox origin steam and the epic game store all with cross-play compatibility - and full virtual reality support the single-player element of squadrons will be a starting point of the game and it focuses on a story spanning across two different factions the Vanguard squadron they're the rebels and the Titan squadron the Empire these pilots are fully customizable and the story itself will see you switching between your pilots on either side seeing both sides of the war through individual missions the trailer doesn't really go into how much depth this story is going to have but the focus seems to be on the player honing their skills and getting familiar with all eight available ships before they progress to the online element of the game which is broken up into two distinct game modes the first PvP game mode is dogfights and this is a straight-up 5vs5 battle where two teams earn points by destroying upon star fighters in a traditional team deathmatch setting flee battles on the other hand is the second PvP game mode and it's what squadrons is calling their signature mode and it reminds me a lot of operations from battlefield and in this mode you'll play both with and against other real players and AI all by yourself with AI in a multi stage objective based battle which will see you advance the front line first by taking out a couple of capital ships to go on and reach your primary objective of destroying the enemy flagship it's a bit of a tug of war between different battle scenarios so in terms of the classes of ships that you're flying this game there are four of them in total defines a class that includes the TIE fighter and x-wing and these are the most flexible and versatile ships and the best all-rounders for any situation and then you've got the interceptor class which includes the Ty interceptor and the a wing and these are fast highly maneuverable ships ideal for hunting down the enemy and a bit of stealth the support class which includes the Tie Reaper and the you wink whose purpose is really to try and keep allies safe and stocked up and lastly the bomber class which includes the tie bomber and the y-wing and these guys are able to deal heavy damage to enemy flag ships and star fighters with massive bombing runs what's cool about this game is that every single ship can be customized down to the pilot from cosmetics over 50 different components that can alter the gameplay in the way that your ship flies how it fights and survives including stuff like changing your primary weapons your auxiliaries countermeasures the whole shields engines stuff like deflector shields sensor jammers proton torpedoes Iron missiles turret mine's even beam cannons so lots of customization and adjustments that you can make to your ship and they did say that none of these gameplay altering components will be purchasable with real money that we either earned or unlocked by a game play your customization choices come down to your preferred spec of each of your ships meaning you could kit out you're a wing with the lighter hull to keep it fast but equip a sensor jammer so the enemy can't see you coming and then maybe you've got your you wings which you can equip with a supply droid and perhaps a targeting jammer so you can disrupt the enemy from hitting your teammates each component offers unique elements to your ship and some have a trade off so it's up to you is the player to decide for example do you want more protection against blaster fire but less against missiles or vice versa do you want more speed or do you want more damage you have to manage that on the fly and we can see that in the game from what looks like the hood of the car PIPP I don't know if they've disabled the real heads-up display for the trailer to make it look more cinematic but obviously there's a lot of information on the screen there the health of the vehicle the components you've got your ammunition the speed you're going the damage of your lasers so it does look like everything is on screen in front of you but I wouldn't be surprised if there is an additional ho tellement that they've disabled from this trailer like a crosshair for example it also appears that the game is first-person only from everything that I've read online it seems that way well though in the trailer there was a couple of shots where it almost seemed like it was in third person but I don't know if they were just doing that for the sake of being cinematic or third-person will be an option here I think it's just the first-person only game and they've intentionally designed it in that way I think it would be really cool though if this is the in-game hook you can see everything in front of you right there and you can decide how your ships power can be channeled between your engine your speed your laser power shield strength at any given time and it's all there in real time in front of you and being able to master that and knowing which ships perform best in certain situations seems like it will be key to the gameplay and depending on which ship that you lean towards they said that it may or may not prioritize the matchmaking to put you into that specific faction whether it's for loyalty or functionality either way that's our first look at the gameplay and it's cool to get a better understanding of how the game will work I'm definitely excited to try this one out it feels like it could be quite a tactical game especially when playing with friends in 5v5 and I like the fact that it seems the deadest have stuck to their guns here and maybe a first-person only I was a massive fan of Rogue Squadron on the Nintendo 64 as a kid and I know how enjoyable these kind of games can be with deep enough mechanics hopefully this one follows suit and can fulfill that Star Wars pilot itch for me once again with that said do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below what do you think of
