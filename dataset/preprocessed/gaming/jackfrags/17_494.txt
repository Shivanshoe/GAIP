i've got a magic 8-ball watch ask it a question um will we win this game most likely should we use the kilo of course it said cameron and i come around the back dead nice nice directly northeast god yeah one's that sounds very exciting uh balcony so good just atv dropping into the area another daddy he's just rest on the by again blast him he's late he's broke he's broke down got him yes ruined and there's another one he's off him on the left he's gonna bite there's a sniper looking at us yeah i'm gonna watch your stream instead you better get this stub no pressure yes hi guys hope you're all doing well and welcome back to warzone i've taken a bit of a break the last time i played it was about 10 days ago now couple of reasons i felt like i needed some time off though primarily i think it really needs that map change and a new injection of weapons to shake the meta up a bit luckily for us though activision have just announced that on the 16th of december warzone season 1 is beginning and this will bring with it 30 black ops cold war weapons and a new version of the map this is rumored to be some map changes and new area potentially alcatraz island so obviously that's got me really excited exploring new parts of the map 30 new weapons that's just insane imagine the loadout video possibilities be interesting to see if it kills some of the old weapons too second reason the juggernauts i've already made a video about this but juggies should not be in normal matches especially now that there's a glitch allowing you to duplicate them so you're going to start seeing entire three or four player squads of juggies in a normal game and that's definitely not the one hopefully that will get patched soon but i have to say that i am pretty hyped for the 16th and i'll be making a ton of videos and live streams for warzone when that new update kicks off so that little montage that you saw just at the start of the video was from the first couple of games back that i played yesterday with study and westy shame about the crash though but i am glad that the boys got the win and the next game i'm about to show you that we played after that was just as crazy and what i loved about this one was that the ending has a number of very good squads in it and it felt incredibly competitive which is what i love to see towards the end of the game as the difficulty curve ramps up as for my loadout in this one i didn't want to use the kilo as the magic 8 ball watch had suggested so instead i went for this amax build that rips absolutely devastating and this is how i had my spr set up for those long range quick snipes when warzone works i still have an absolute blast with it and i do think that it is still the best pr game as always a massive thank you to everyone using my supporter creator code in the cod store i've had a load of people tweet me pictures when they've used it so do keep those coming if you enter the code jackfrags in all caps and buy anything i'll get a percentage of that sale cheers i appreciate you so here we go then you're in for a treat with this game and if you enjoy it leave a like let's get it back in the trash is inside in the truck he's in the truck down one on the white building he's dead behind you oh distract yes what the hell one each of the areas shotgun but is it going to be good it's fine there we go oh that was sick boys that was sick there's another one was that the decoy that's deeper what were they doing where do they come from how do they all come back at the same time they all parachute in go go go that literally was like a proper like sas or marine drop like oh drop on the road i kind of feel sorry for the dev that implemented the underground system the thing is it was broken when it first started like it didn't work properly it was killing people like the first couple of days yeah that didn't help no would you like to use this new gameplay feature it's got a 50 chance of killing you no are you sure one's going to go up blue building one's inside that yellow building i mean oh my god oh god no oh god it's an assault this is a meme it's where we came from oh nice absolute dirt lovely in this jacket this two guys on orange has he gone down the ladder yeah okay yeah i think so that's it chop it down man go for it oh my god oh vehicle vehicle behind fire station yeah get it spammed keep going let's just get to this thing when we get killed at this supply crate most likely the watch says yes get it i'll leave the truck here so we can make a good escape if we need to right okay i'll cover hopefully oh boy just go all the way around and come back to the shop enemy soldier jack are incoming down there what is what okay um okay yeah he's done that sign there on their own stroke they you can get to the tents i think you'll probably be all right for a second just out of the team yeah are they on the ice here three one are they just waiting in a room underneath here yeah and then

over at the stadium they're good players we might be better off on the other side of the road on the rocks we might be better here target right here just put an airstrike on him they're more dangerous on the left yeah yeah the ones that are in front of us southeast they're the best squad we've got a good position here we've got a good position they're gonna come around the right i think with the sticky nice pushing windows closing get to safety there you go no there's one on my right guys team one behind the rocks i think i've got one one he's lit he's lit that's kind of thing you can get
