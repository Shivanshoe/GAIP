hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome back to call of duty warzone season five today i've got 10 times 2 400 cod points to give away and we'll be dropping them in the chat over the course of the next couple hours and we are going to be playing some stimulus buyback solos because i had loads of fun playing that earlier today but also we're going to check out some new areas of the map where there's some potential easter egg stuff going down and i'm all about the easter egg stuff so if you drop a stadium you can find these key cards and there are different key cards for different doors and if you get a key card you can open whatever door that relates to and inside the doors there are loot crates but there's also a computer that flashes a code now in the stadium there is one room that no one can get in and that's because it's got a keypad on the door and no one's figured out the code yet so i wanted to jump in today take a look at the new stuff perhaps visit some older creepy areas of the map and see if we can figure anything out i doubt that we can but it'll be interesting either way and hopefully we can get some dubs as well in your buyback solos well thank you for coming along today should be good fun i hope you're all having a delightful thursday i'm sure that in some parts of the world the time travelers it's already friday it's you guys out there in the future living the good life but for me it's still thursday so we're going to be playing a couple hours as i said i do have 2 400 times 10 cod points to give away for pc and we'll be dropping those in the chat gonna have a good time i did level up the a94 a little bit i still haven't maxed it i don't have the monolithic suppressor yet and i feel like you need that on every single gun so i'm ruined [Laughter] we can have a good time we are going to have a great time tonight jonathan hanson said try glitching into the door well i don't know about that jonathan if i managed to figure something out i'd want to do it legit i wouldn't want to glitch inside it because it could be that if you glitch inside the room something doesn't spawn or something doesn't happen right so really you'd want to do things in the legitimate fashion wouldn't you but we're going to try this in buy back solos first oh it's brutal and if that doesn't work out we'll try it in blender and see how that goes yeah what this is a 725 with a suppressor on it this is it's actually pretty sick not that i would use it in actual war zone but oh you want some let's go practice is over the real fight begins now try using the an-94 single fire it's op i tried it a bit yesterday louie and i just wasn't feeling it man i just wasn't feeling it this is gonna be a really hot drop for stadium it's going to be nuts [Music] oh man so in this game mode if you have at least 4 500 on you i thought it was 4 000 because they changed it in trios you can respawn which is kind of cool [Music] just watch the amount of people that drop stadium here it's going to be great here we go i'm not going in the main way though i'm gonna go around the back fight oh that's not the back no i've come to the wrong area guys i'm in the wrong section oh no no no no i'm ruined well i'm going to back out a second here get these plates on i wanted to go in the underground parking bit this bill there yeah this is weird because usually this is safe no no no no someone's throwing little flashbang grenades i do see that armor plate there i'll try and get that chill here for a second no one behind me okay yeah i've gone to the wrong bit they're full of a two jack a fool of a took i don't know where the windows are i still haven't properly learned this area yet yeah give me an mp7 let's go i think he's right above me like inside above me yeah watch the skies someone just dropped in there hello p90 big fan of the p90 although the scar did some serious work there i'll put that there because anyone running around the corner should get ruined by that ruined like a bruin this has been a nice little run around the outside doesn't it i've enjoyed it i've enjoyed it is that striker look at that skin that skin is sick big fan of that why was he looking what what i i don't understand what happened then anyways i swear we'll get there okay we've nearly made it by this point i'm sure the keycard's gone or i just get killed well i think it's around here careful of the windows there's someone up there okay here it is all right this is the underground section as long as there's no one here waiting for me i should be able to show you guys this stuff right okay we're good we're good i don't think there's anyone here you can drive a car around under here it's kind of cool i like that a lot i've been getting fake reloads as well i don't know if you guys did you see the the video i posted earlier i swear i had a fake reload what i mean by that is the reload animation completes but it doesn't actually reload for you it used to be a big problem in the battlefield games i have a card i do actually have a card when did i pick that up the guy that i killed must have must have dropped it well that's lucky isn't it it's almost like it spawned on me or something they knew that i was going to be live streaming right so the door is over here so as long as no one's gone in it i can show you guys what's inside jump over here yeah no one's there right i think this will get us in so there's a keypad here there you go look at that and there's some crates in here usually you get orange crates there's a lot of money plus the strike and this it's the matrix house number four house weird squiggle five whizz wiggle where's wiggle two guys i i don't know what it means house four house squiggle five squiggle squiggle two gone so it's some kind of a code now in this stadium there are two other rooms like this and you need the key cards to get in them and as i said at the start there is an executive sweet at the top with a keypad and there's a couple of uh twitch streamers and easter egg communities on discord that have been trying to figure this out today and no one's done it i've never been in this room yet it's the changing room i feel like a real football player guys i've made it it's the league final everything is on the line all you got to do is put the ball in the back of the net that's it repositioning he shoots he scores right now where see i don't really know i don't really know my way around the stadium to get to that executive suite i'm not sure how you get to it is it above me here might be on the next level no that's just back outside oh i'm gonna have to leave soon all right okay here we go we're going up uav overhead peter said it's part of a longer key code the symbols are placeholders for other numbers so you're telling me the symbols represent numbers is that what you're saying don't know how you get to the executives where is it that's the bar area god i need to go and plunder and learn it or something i think it's just around like one of these bits here somewhere that's all the same it's just beneath the roof isn't the whole building the roof oh what do you mean i don't know i don't i don't think i'd be able to get in there at the moment anyway because i don't have all the codes i've only got one code but it is something it's the start of something i don't know what it will lead to but it's kind of cool anyways there's no way that those symbols don't mean anything they're clearly there for a reason all right i don't know what to i'll just go with the the meta for this game i've got that cluster strike as well if i need it i'm sure i will at some point berticus said in the chat the symbols are from the shanghai shuffle wasn't that something in black ops i'm sure that was part of a black ops easter egg at one point right sure it was uh i'd like to get to that buy station really take the truck good good where's the trainer oh somebody just shot at me yeah my textures are completely broke again [Music] i'm out of here mate i'm out hopefully he doesn't have a c4 please no c4 please no c4 that's fine if that guy would have just shot at the truck he probably would have killed me then there is also a code lock with eight numbers in bunker zero zero where's bunker zero zero isn't that like 11 bunkers there's a lot of bunkers oh don't want to go to that buy that one's horrible that one the cards despawn after a while oh yeah i don't have it anymore look it's gone where's it gone did i get a crate today no geeky gamer i don't have a crate today give me did someone send me a crate no i haven't had anything today you talking about real life please don't kill me wherever you are right let's get a armor plate bundle uav we got recon online uh again another uav for later well should we get we got low dead okay we're gonna respawn it's at the bottom of the map nathan said okay like the one right down here i know there's one all the way down here look at my uav still there uh storage town no no no no no no i don't want to go back there no i'm scared good loot airport [Music] please no kill i think this has been looted i was just browsing the shop oh what should i get today what's on the menu ruined okay there's someone here no why can't you carry two of the same gun don't get it just trying to be sneaky here because there's someone near me i don't want to drop back to storage there's a repel there i think he's right above me did you know it was there i'll be failure's a wise teacher i think he just heard me go there i guess how many kills five girls yeah he must have just heard me fair play do you shave your toes that's such a weird question do you mean do i cut my toenails yeah of course i cut my toenails i don't shave them you don't shave

which is 2 400 card points and there's uh 10 of these in total and we'll do them over the next two hours or so there it is what is this one warm-up with a grenade launcher what the hell and a pink shot good look at this what are those oh it's the anime one isn't it what's up alexander miller from tennessee hennessey is that is that right preparation is done yeah the codes are for pc i'm going to speak to the cod guys because they they're the ones that give the codes to me you know they sponsor the stream they give me codes to give away that you guys can have and i'm gonna see if i can get some console codes because they they're always pc i know there's obviously a lot of people who watch me who play on console as well battle gas closing royale fast get to the safe zone but there will be nine more but i think 2400 is enough to buy the battle pass and a couple of other things so yeah i mean it's uh it's a nice little nice little gift first come first serve whoever gets it and you can buy some skins or whatever you want did i just see someone in that hangar there i think i saw someone in there maybe it was a gnome or something is it a small gnome i don't know are there gnomes in this game maybe you guys seen any gnomes i don't know about that another orange box okay this is good first two crates that i open are orange boxes i've already got one i did hear a glass smash over there i think i can get into one of the bunkers with that right dude right outside it's a horror game it's it's a horror game guys i swear there's a bunker over here isn't there up there it's a horror game come on land back on you and your stuff i don't know if i can get into bunker 11 without one i'm your step bro this whole time i had a step brother i wish i had a different scope on it i

it i did have an airstrike i left there i could have used that couldn't i actually to get that guy out i lost it when i bought the loadout i'm gonna go back there get the bounty of course it's the guy in the truck you still in there if it's here i'm just going to pick it up and use it oh yeah now maybe there [Music] someone oh you coming back here please do [Applause] a stronger soaker upper someone just got a load out over there hello requesting recon damn it what oh the computer bro this guy this is solos in a nutshell the guy over here he just i shoot him and he runs over there is this guy real i've got gas inbound please what is he doing thank you for the ammo as well that's not as much as i'd have liked this loadout is dodgy because there's a guy over here zone's coming to me though luckily which is good uh i could i could do that for a bit of recon another orange box perfect look at that uh let's do this failed you're out of time you're out of time have a look around [Applause] i don't see anyone around oh man could i make it to that loadout drop and get ghost i think i'll be all right i don't see anyone on thermal or someone over there actually move me [Applause] all the way out there i think i'll be okay unless there's someone right above me let's go um why does it take 10 years to do that i don't know nobody knows it just does yeah the drone's got thermal patch go neal it's really useful you know really useful this is what i wanted though heartbeat sensor i've got ghost now as well sir feeling strong about this quarry is not a nice place to go after a bounty i'll do it anyway it's fine isn't it i think it's fine i've not been to quarry in ages i just don't come here because it is really horrible to fight over and if you want to go anywhere it just takes like 15 years well maybe not 15 years but yeah it takes a long time i feel like you need a sniper over here too relocating different guys doing that why every time that i stream you guys come in

skies [Music] no thank you right in the middle of the pitch loving it oh this game mode is fun as hell where the hobby sensor at where is it give it to me i need it now i want to see the heartbeat i don't care if you don't have a heartbeat so this is the executive suite that i was talking about this is the one watch the skies did not work you need code you have to have code enemy uav overhead oh there's lots of loot in there cannot get in no no no why'd you keep saying for narnia in the chat what does that even mean i don't know what narnia is but i mean what year is it 2001 like they're not narnia movies are just that's dead isn't it like narnia's done it's gone guys forget narnia they all died the lion just killed them all aslan just went sicko mode murdered all the kids ruined all the wizards and the elves and the the taurus weird people like they're all gone as well aslan just killed everyone the end sorry that i support that for you but that's it's the truth i'm not i'm not going to sugarcoat it for you that's what happened did i hear someone down there i feel like they've improved the audio a bit i feel like it's a bit better at the other side yes oh what oh it's the box ten years late look how slow this zooms in ah guys hold on there's a target here let me just yeah oh there actually was enemy marked actually was someone there there's a quad bike over here oh here's someone come on come on behind me yeah i could just spend the entire day here this is great don't try and drop shot in war zone it doesn't work okay it works sometimes i admit it works sometimes a few moments later ten thousand years later three million years later one eternity late okay that guy's gone i feel like i want to go around there though i've got no place look how much cash i've got man i should be spending some of this money i like the iron sights on the out they're really cool so that guy was like here reposition well not there he's down there somewhere who goes that bye why is the loadout gone there [Music] it's in the stadium okay uh brett thank you for the 10. the stadium is massive bill it's huge i kind of like that though it takes ages to run around hostile dropping into the area watch the skies below me yeah it definitely improved the footsteps you coming up are you finding someone the ass entanglement i didn't realize those stairs were so long i have a feeling he had a nice growl i'll be all right we look kind of clear custom corner yeah old growth let's do it we are moving on i could just get ghost i don't know why you'd put it three times on a growl though don't agree with that i've got time yeah i've got time yeah this stadium is sick i've done such a good job with it put your heartbeat sensor down mate what is that it's an odin please don't shoot me please don't shoot me uh do i keep this guy's growl no i'll go around seven round seven's cool all right i thought i had a gas mask oh no no no oh guys so i can't go back and get it i could buy one go on the left oh this site sucks is that guy just gone to that bye enemy uav overhead enemy uav overhead did you have a gas mask yeah you did hey look everything's fine everything turned out better than expected this guy up here on that building there was in that building right there oh man you probably heard me uav is out of fuel returning to resupply it's fine i didn't check [Music] that's kind of cool there's a ghosty boy can i go up will i die if i go up what do you reckon i'm gonna do it anyway for the name can i see the head show me the head i would like to see the head 50 remain i'm not taking that [Applause] you can stay there come on you gotta go what are you doing i'm waiting for you enemy uav overhead what do you get for chewing on me what was that bullet about then i don't like that that screams hacker that does just a random bullet that came my way then all right there's a guy up there all right okay hopefully i can uh count this and go don't shave me don't shoot me don't shoot me it's fine it's fine don't head shot me just don't hedge on me as long as you don't hit me in the head it's fine just please don't hit me in the head okay it's fine there's a guy there this guy above there's a guy there somewhere you see forward my quad bike kind of in a bit of a bad position here because that sniper is still there on the right it's fine it's fine watch out for that sniper he's still there i think yeah i guess he is did you have m4 p90 i don't like this i can't forget to use that airstrike either because that could be really useful i don't know why that dude pushed he didn't have to push where's that name up here my hangers i kill someone that's got an hdr i'd rather have that a suit plate 500 sec dude thank you so much that's really kind hostile dropping into the area watch the skies all right mate and there was a sniper out there still yeah i'm not not liking that that plate box for later he's probably got an hdr or something i don't know where that car 98 shot went by the way that i fired because it was right on him it just didn't didn't connect for some reason no one hiding here is there i don't really like this it's too open go under the bridge but then i'm running towards the sniper he was right up there it's really open i don't have a choice though that's good cover from the sniper i think he's still up there okay we can chill under here for a second there's still 35 people alive i'm just gonna wait here and see where the circle goes how someone just dropped in there did you see that just like that big explosion out there we could just be patient for one second before we see where the next circle's going and then i can make up a plan figure out where to go man those buildings twins is looking good right now but twins has got a repel now so it's not as defensible anymore oh dearie me i think that sniper's probably still up there don't need that loadout respawns are off now so if i die i'll die that's a bush there's always a bush that looks like a player isn't that or someone right here stay sharp out there okay so i think that's that little excursion gone these guys don't ax50 okay i'll take it enemy uav overhead target areas okay he's putting c4 on the stairs now this is a really bad position to be ideally i'd like to have been on one of these twin buildings right now there's a guy there there's a guy with a right shield there oh man this sucks come through that door overhead he's going to run through i'm going to kill him that guy's going to run through i'm going to stay for him or maybe not i hate riot shields so much stun is good though i don't want to give him a heartbeat sensor you could just wait leave it really late i think everyone's gonna do that though i don't get caught in my gas mask animation either yeah i know someone in here can they get to the roof i think they can right i can get around the back here if i want so i do have an out just going to play this really sneaky as sneaky as i can this is quite a good angle here this should be in this cover unless there's someone in this building just in here a couple of plates there i could get only five left okay come back to me circle come back to me oh no it just it just gets smaller in this game mode oh oh this is bad this is bad i kind of want to be in the building so that's where they all are none of them have got ghosts they really all in the building look at this look at this they're all in the building [Applause] right they're fighting this is good one left i think he's above me trying to stay as central as i can i think he's right above this is coming down to the wire he's outside so to mask off yes my god jeez i i need to know what my heart rate is right now i need i need to know because that is that is an insane game right there that is a crazy crazy crazy game oh man i think that's the best game of war zone i've ever played honestly i think that is the best game of war zone i've ever played [Music] i'm so happy that i won that [Music] oh dear deary dude that is a book clencher if i've ever seen one [Laughter] i think i should rip that one and post it as a video crazy mad game i'm glad you guys could see that i'm glad that you could watch that oh sway sway sway you know i'm gonna i'm gonna drop i'm gonna drop a few more codes in the chat right now i'll just wait for it to calm down a sec because it's just popping off right now mad game uh we did get some new members during that match sorry i wasn't really paying attention uh josh canuck mr scott again thank you kaperian thank you for the donation crown schnazzy check your gear clay thank you banana slick wick fluid suplex cody the man thank you uh daddy pop thank you gaza west miguel lee and jerry two times that was a mad game wouldn't it absolutely mud i enjoyed that you know there's not many games that could give me that feeling but warzone does warzone gives me that feeling it reminds me when reminds me when we used to play daisy and everything's on the line right in about 30 seconds you'll see some codes pop up in the chat they're 2 400 cod points for pc i'm gonna put three in the chat there's one there's two here's the third one that's going in right now there you go there's three in the chat first come first serve activate them on blizzard get yourself 2 400 points right then where should we go battle royale avoid the gas get to the save uh what's up fire guy you're new here well thank you for coming fire guy i appreciate you man abbas love your content thank you abbas uh cody upgraded their membership to fountain thank you cody uh jocelyn thank you very much for the five so they are pc only tonight but i'm gonna have a word with the cod guys and see if i can get some console codes for next stream uh john thank you for the five primary objective is to eliminate all targets i need to focus up again now come down a bit no one drop here surely someone else dropped here no one oh superstore it was right over the top of the plane [Music] i could get load out already if i wanted ah see why that guy cannot have their loadout so why are they not on heartbeat center how are you not on hobby center you don't have your loadout that makes me wonder you know is there is there something in the game like if you crouch in a corner and don't move does that does that mean you're not on heartbeat center because that guy didn't have his loadout so he doesn't have ghost there's something there's something to that i think i need to do some testing i can get one of my friends and we can get on the same game together to find out it could have been a glitch but usually the heartbeat sensor works all around i don't think it's a cheater uh keith i don't i don't know if cheetahs can actually hide themselves from heartbeat sensor [Music] i think it was more likely it was a glitch or something nothing a little bear it's nice to get heartbeat center so early in the game when you play solos okay there's always enemy dropping in he's right above me there's a guy on the other side of the store as well god keith how do i like stadium yeah stadium is great i think it's brilliant what they've done love it just gonna wait i could go to a bye all right let's go to that one yeah did anyone find out about uh doctor disrespect is he actually streaming now on youtube imagine if i'd hit that i would have been great but i didn't so i suck i did just give my position away though which is bad in a really bad angle buy station identify danny why don't i go full graphics it's because when you play on low graphics it's a little easier to see people and also you get more frames it just feels smoother i've got a 240hz monitor and i want to try and get as many cranes as possible well that's ruined my plans good to go doc is live right now where is he live is he actually streaming on youtube [Music] he is he's soon right sure there was someone there right that's kind of cool if he's moved to youtube honestly i think at this point like youtube live streaming if you want to grow i think it's the best place to be youtube's got so many good search algorithms and way that they push live stuff is good it's kind of hard to search for people on twitch like discover abilities really really difficult on twitch head of your weight i don't know if i should take this fight with no armor plates but kind of want to place one plate yeah they've changed it you know they've changed it so every time you kill someone they drop a plate even if they don't have any i kind of like that a lot it incentivizes people to go for kills rather than just camp all right okay i'm good alejandro what's up from mexico how you doing man you coming around here he's got a hundred thousand people watching him that is impressive you've got gas moving in i think there's someone next to me i swear i can hear footsteps maybe i'm just crazy we got recon online what is going on here moving here there's a lot of people behind me in this superstar hdr is it okay did no way uh suplate thanks so much again for the 500 dude that's very kind i appreciate you man yeah i think if doc is streaming on youtube now i reckon he's gonna have more viewers than when he was on twitch honestly he's got a very good video editor too so when he does his live streams he can just have someone edit them you know the highlights the good games ah and then he can stream and the way that youtube works it's really good at pushing live streams especially if you've already got a viewer base this is nasty i don't know what i'm doing here man i'm dead think i'm dead [Applause] don't know the drop on this build jack o'neill thanks for the 10. when that guy go 118 000 and it's only the intron oh man he is loving it someone firing at someone's firing an explosive sniper at me moving here uav is out of fuel returning to resupply i don't know where that guy was firing at me from but enemy uav overhead i don't like it is that you are you the explosive guy who is can we please stop i feel like i'm being artillery strikes or something what is going on 125k damn that's insane i couldn't imagine having that many viewers is this what it sounds like when someone's got a explosive rightek something going down over there unless no they're not in the atc oh by the way they added there's a zip rope in the in the dam so you can get up if you're stuck down there vehicle here actually added a repel oh this reminds me of the round i played earlier that i posted [Music] gas is moving someone in the chat said how are the cheetahs um to be honest i played last night with study and fireborn we played for about two and a half hours i played two games this morning and i played what we're doing now and how long have i been live like an hour and a half an hour and 45 minutes or something hasn't been any cheers as far as i know no obvious ones at least someone was in here they just fired a shot don't want to stand tall stand still too long damn it you could ghost this guy in they're not watching their back come down there oh there was one down there that's right we got to respawn didn't see that dude you've just been to dr disrespect screen there's 130 000 people looking at a live wallpaper don't think he's trolling i think he probably will be live later or soon he's just he's a high pipe guy isn't he's hyping people up i was here when i died right not my body [Music] jump oh come on game don't do me like this we lost that one we'll come back to bronco next time that was a nice shot let's watch this guy the talk spy if that was a legit shot that's a very good shot he's got a heartbeat center nice m13 build he better be live people will get mad at this yeah got dead silence on running in behind you behind you how did he get away with that i think this guy killed me the first time as well with a headshot 170 000 people watching him oh my god wow 25 remain solid work he's getting a few nice kills looks like this guy's on controller as well i think it's difficult to tell with the spec cam because the tick rate is not very good he's waiting for 500 000 before he starts is that true vincent i don't know if he'll get 500 000 oh that'd be epic if he did like fair play i saw ninja did a stream on youtube didn't he about a month ago and he had 140 000 viewers 180 thousand something like that uh nicholas owen thank you for becoming a member jack o'neill thanks for the ten sylvia thank you for the ten i always catch these at work but i love watching when i have a few seconds thanks for the good content sylvia that's really kind you thank you de mortem thank you for the five i don't know what you're referring to de mortem sorry and silvia became a member as well mike thanks for the two and dingbat dan jack how have i not noticed your life oh have i not noticed you until recently brilliant entertainment what do i think the next big thing on warzone will be i think the truly next big thing will be the map changing there's a lot of rumors that when the new cod game is out this year the whole map is going to change into whatever that cod game is and thanks to doritos we know that it's called call of duty black ops cold war so you can assume it's in the 1980s or 90s maybe it depends where they go with it are they going to stay true to real life or are they going to go complete just crazy with it i don't know benji we had a look at the easter eggs at the start yeah this guy's on controller i mean the way that that move then just want to keep watching a little bit longer see if he gets any more kills i think he's just good camping out the building is there someone in there he didn't have anyone on heartbeat there there was someone there i think the gun just stuck out turn around if possible uh cassius thank you man there's a dude down on his left as well i'm sure i saw someone there here we go get your sniper out let's go hit that headshot again he's right there in the window he's in the window yellow building window he saw him doesn't have an angle don't shoot don't you don't need to shoot just gave his position away there just missed that one shiz how does the ram 7 compare to the m13 ram 7's brilliant honestly it's my probably my new favorite assault rifle it destroys people up close i think the foul is like the only thing that can beat it close range and the file's kind of broken so what's up psychoarmy exactly rafi you prefer the stream cool yeah i did say that this august i'd be streaming a lot more i've kept it up so far i think it's been going good we've already completed uncharted i know that didn't really have like that many viewers but i wanted to play that game and by all accounts the people that watched it really enjoyed it so that's that's what's important to me go on hit it yeah he is on controller i hate the fact that he nailed two perfect head shots on me was the ground earth yet no the grouse not been changed they're doing a weapon balance pass soon the growl got nerfed before but it didn't really change much it definitely affected the damage at range though and you can feel that the bruin is silly though the brewing is just stupid and the foul i think is broken at close range it beats everything it's a massive assault rifle it shouldn't be an mp5 or an mp7 up close but it does samuel i've not tried the farmer since the patch no oh he's right next to him damn he got flanked well gg do you see who wins this one we've got conan here with a couple of kills talk about that gold growl conan wins fair play conan i've never seen the movie conan with arnold schwarzenegger i've never watched it but yeah the the war zone streams are going great and by all accounts when i post them afterwards is a video everyone says that they like to watch them so i'm happy with that there's a lot of people here right now 15 000 hopefully i'm keeping you guys entertained hopefully you stick around thank you aj louie doc might just get 500k that would be crazy uh swizzy thank you for becoming a member mr moody don't i ever play the metro series i played metro exodus and i played the first metro game i haven't completed them all though i did complete stalker back in the day if you guys remember that's really what metro is based off well it's it's almost like a spiritual successor to stalker okay i'm gonna drop a couple more codes you bear with me a second in about 30 seconds you'll see a lot of codes pop up in the stream and these are 2400 cod points thanks to activision call of duty for sending them my way and sponsoring the stream here we go preparation is done now you deployed battle royale gas is closing in your position so we've got three left and we'll do those after this game let's go stadium again it's good fun good fun a deviant thank you for the 20 would you rather have guns be like laser growl wild ak i'd like the guns to have a bit more recoil in this game but that's just because i'm more of a tactical fps fan but it's called a juicy you're clear to engage all targets okay sure there was someone on the right push me there's a guy right there going to come down the stairs any second and him over there oh this guy is just waiting for me right up there i think or is he below me could be above actually all right we're going up let's do this and i'm dead you know never use that one so i understand him damn it right i'm gonna go get that plate and then jump down come get the finish it's annoying still one on that left side oh man you could just stay up here the whole game couldn't you you're liable to get flanked though because of the repels i love that they put those there bounty contract identified let's go for that let's do it no loot up here either really like it's just this the stands are kind of empty aren't they you've got to go inside to get the loot look at this looks like a pizza shop what is going on there nice little dead silence hmm big orange box yes i would like that a lot that's that's a meta mp7 this guy above below where is he enemy uav overhead it's so weird that you can just run into the stadium i think this is above me uh hostile dropping into the area watch the skies where's the repeller cuteness overload why not play on console i'm terrible on controller dude i've been a pc gamer in my entire life so i like the benefits of playing on pc just keep dropping i like having high fps i like having bigger fov the biggest thing for me is the mouse and then secondly it's being able to play with a high frequency monitor because the game is just so smooth when you get a 240hz monitor it's uh it's a huge difference over playing at 60 hertz if i if i play at 60 hertz it gives me a headache i'm not joking actually gives me a headache oh where is this guy man i could be downstairs i suppose that's it with the bounty you don't get levels it doesn't tell you what level they're on yeah you want to see the inspect there you go they just added it in the latest patch he's on he's on the roof right above me i'm gonna miss it as well am i unless they peek right here they're just camping that repel there i think maybe they are yeah that's them fire again i could see my legs wow couldn't see his head let's go back from ah once you go 240 hertz you can't go back yeah that's right kind of want revenge you know i'll go up there i'm dead obviously he's like right there i think i need to learn this state stadium i thought there was an ascend there there's not those stairs go up yeah okay cool all right i don't think this guy has moved i reckon he's still there yeah there he is okay sweet revenge all right now you come back and let me kill you and then you're out the game what's up brewing i don't know what that is kind of i want to keep my stuff again dude he was about to rpg me just see that sorry okay give me more give me more let's go think we're clear i just heard someone then am i hearing someone was it this weird thing here i don't know hostel dropping into the area watch the skies where how did i miss that enemy uav overhead bro this guy's custom sniper is not the one thermals are like six months ago come on it's her body there i think it is i love fighting over this stadium area now they've completely changed this for me this whole area i just would never come here and now i love it i think it's great okay right so there is someone on the roof i feel like using that repel let's go back there why not enemy uav overhead i thought that was a player then this guy right here [Applause] don't like that the train's coming [Applause] right there oh man that was scary let's go up and die why not where is the one that gets you on the top of the stadium is that on the other side is that over here somewhere what is the weapon i'm using it's a ram seven this one here is around seven i've got some skully camo on it reminds me of the phantom camo from battlefield 4 that's why i put it on love that stuff heading out never mind someone just got murdered down there come on bro i'm a bit worried someone's just going to run up on me here enemy uav overhead this guy's got to move because of the zone i feel like that was a different guy i don't know he was running cold-blooded though so it could have been the same head now uh juan thank you for the 250. decided to fail on you today your internet watching the stream and quarantine there was a very similar message to that yesterday thank you enemy uav overhead head footsteps underneath me i think just gonna chill here for a sec see if i can get a kill here i'm nearly in 50 still active good hunting enemy marked what kind of drop is on this sniper i think that was right i was just a bit to the right maybe a bit higher up enemy marked i hate thermal scopes man i can't use them for the life right here if only this was my hcr god i'd kill all those maybe i don't want to say i definitely would have done maybe just maybe moving oh there was someone right there they dropped off damn it give me a decent sniper place oh that one's zoned in don't think i'm being flanked gotta move now the rain of the stadium is over we tried our best okay we're safe oh buy station identified okay uav no one's camping this i need recon on my position look at this big cluster of people there someone just dropped in uav is out of fuel returning to resupply bingo on fuel a really bad area to be here could get that contract get identified bit of insight into the area watch the skies enemy march dude come on doesn't have to go like this oh you scared the life army dude that looks like a good hdr build good please dice thank you in this building right here above me i think this one on the left where'd you go you can hear him respawn you had a load of cash i think we're clear on this side now someone dropped in there i just got beamed as well keep using the heartbeat should we go through go around 50 meters this way enemy uav overhead someone here someone just threw something right here foreign on the roof there i guess that's a pretty good position [Applause] that sounds like a growl or a bruin damn put a cluster on it could be someone with ghosts around here maybe coming from that building there's definitely a few ghosty boys here isn't there play the long game as much as i can probably someone in there i really want to go in to be honest no buy stations i could use either is this going to be in right here this corner located less than five oh man that's nasty i still think there's someone in this building with ghost or just right next to me watch that door for a second no i knew it what was that two guys left someone just open a door or a crate here there maybe this isn't quite in this is right i'm going to get screwed by the circle or i'm going to be okay this is your last one i think there's someone in here where did you come from one guy left you on the roof that was meticulous i love that oh yes a really exhilarating game again brilliant i have to post that one as well i'm gonna have to post that that was brill my i'll tell you buyback solos are incredible this is my new favorite game mode it's the best mode in the game this is the best mode in the game jeez wow right so i've got three more coats to drop they're gonna go in the chat in about
