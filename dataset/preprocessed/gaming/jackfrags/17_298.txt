there's now a motorbike gun you can call of duty warzone there it is it revs and everything so i wanted to pick it up and today i've got a couple of solo matches for you some highlights with a bit of play-by-play commentary on top a couple of topics i wanted to talk about as well but these games do have interesting endings no spoilers but i mean ruined is all i'll say so they put buyback solos in the game this week and i like this game mode because i do feel like people tend to play a bit more aggressively than normal solos and regular solos are just an absolute camp fest but because in this if you've got that four thousand five hundred dollars if you die and the rebirth is still available you come back you get another chance so i do find that people tend to be a bit looser in this game mode a bit more aggressive and it can be more fun as a solo player i like regular solos too but it's just a bit of a different twist you know a bit of a different take on it and you often find it's a bit more chaotic lots of people in lots of areas at the same time and i think that was my first kill there with the motorbike gun it's got a dismember effect on it too and it fires golden bullets don't really see how that plays into the motorbike thing maybe because it's just got gold metallic pay on it but you've probably noticed the title of the video of course cheating is pretty bad again in cod war zone it comes in waves doesn't it with warzone right they do like a bandwave they tweet about it but it just feels like we haven't had a ban way for ages and ages and ages the dance in particular i think is really bad right now for jesus and it's the blatant kind right like the obvious ones i've talked about this so many times before i feel like i'm just being a dead horse at this point but it keeps happening doesn't it it just keeps happening again and again and again and again so please try something different give it another shot try something else at this point i'd be up for something like valorents doing with vanguard make a kernel level anti-chi for pc just do it otherwise this is going to keep happening and happening again and again and again and that's the driving conversation isn't it it's not hey look at all this cool new content it's oh there's a load of cheaters in warzone again shane we can't enjoy all that new content because it's just cheers everywhere do you know what i mean like that's that's the way it's gonna go isn't it especially when they launch new games and let's say this year's card is world war ii like everyone's saying and it's rumored what if they do a world war ii map for warzone that's awesome like i'd love a brand new map to play on but if the cheating is still a massive problem at that point then gonna put a pretty nasty stain on it all i don't mean to be overly negative i don't typically do videos like this but i feel compelled to when so many of the games that i've played recently have just had blatant chairs in and i don't know if this is just a pc thing and because i'm playing on mouse and keyboard i'm getting put in pc lobbies probably that's the case but normal trios and quads have not been fun at all recently just because of the amount of cheaters that we're coming across this creates many problems in the community rumors conspiracy theories they all start popping up left right and center does the game even have an antique people say yeah of course it does but it's definitely not as effective as it could be and it also creates distrust between other players and people that you don't know were you just killed and you watched the kill cam maybe it looks a bit suspicious maybe it looks like the dude's got no recoil or you were aim locked or how did that guy know i was there i didn't make any noise in reality perhaps you were on heartbeat center or uav or maybe one of their teammates had live pinged you but you can't blame people for thinking that when cheating is such a rampant problem as it is in the game and all this results in is a really toxic environment that's not great to play in i've made this video like three or four times now but it keeps coming back raven call of duty infinity ward they need to take control of this they need to own it and show people that there is a working anti-ship that they're developing other means other methods to stop cheaters and start to really clamp down on it in a significant way in my opinion personally i think as a good gesture to the community one thing they could do is allow console players to just not play with pc at all no cross play with pc should be an option for xbox one xbox series s and x ps4 and ps5 at the moment you can disable crossplay on playstation but when you search for a match it keeps popping up saying we think you should turn this on we think you should turn this on and you can just keep ignoring it eventually it will put you in a game but the xbox players they can't do that so they're forced to play with pc players and if you think about it the majority of players in this game will be on console they'll be playing on xbox or playstation they will vastly dwarf the number of pc players even though it's free to play i can guarantee the amount of console players in this game is massive compared to the amount of pc players so just do it let people voluntarily play with pc if they want to give them an option let's say they've got friends who play on pc i love that aspect of crossplay i think it's great that that's in the game all these platforms playing together it's very inclusive but when you don't have a solid anti-cheat that's when it starts to become an issue so hey if i've got a friend on pc and i'm on console i can volunteer to play with them that's fine i might be up against other pc players i know what i'm getting in for but if i'm a console player and i just want to play with other console players let them do that give them that choice and don't make it difficult don't put a message on their screen saying hey we recommend you don't do this just let them play with other console players in the meantime until you've got a more solid robust anti-cheat system in place and there's a bit of security with the pc version of the game that's what i do straight away i think that's an easy quick fix especially for the majority of the players in the game protect your biggest player base ring fence them keep them happy because at the moment they're being exposed to cheats and that isn't a great look for your game and i haven't even talked about the advantages that pc players have being in console lobbies i've done entire videos about this where i've done it side by side we've looked at fov frame rate higher frequency monitors lower input lag nvidia filters better visibility and then you plug in a controller on pc you get aim assist and you get put in majority console lobbies so some people just don't think it's fair to start with the pc players are in console lobbies and that's another angle to consider when you're talking about player customer satisfaction in the game that's another huge negative for the majority of the player base the devs the publisher they've got to get a hold of this they've got to put more resources into it and start caring about it a bit more yes they've said in the past they do care about it and they've explained some of the methods that they use in the blog post but perhaps enough isn't being done and it isn't being looked at as aggressively as it could be i mean i've just seen a tweet from charlie intel who are a cod news account and they said that there's a new hack going around for war zone where they can join players lobbies then they can change their levels to 1001 and just unlock all of the weapons and attachments in the game and it was a video a couple weeks ago that tommy posted he's a professional cod player where he had a choose to join his lobby and the cheetah could actually crash his game he could give tommy a dev error so now they can forcibly crash people i mean that's just insane isn't it it's crazy that it's got to that point and i've seen cheats where they don't even have to aim at you i've showed a little clip in a video about a month ago now i think it was where a couple dudes were fighting in a house they got killed and they watched the kill cam and the cheater was literally just aiming at the ground and clicking and doing damage to them it's just how is that possible it just oh man it baffles it absolutely baffles me i feel like the most important thing is what i said earlier when if they gonna keep this game running for a long time which it would appear that they are right they've said that warzone is a long-term commitment it's going to be like the the disney world of call of duty that connects all the games so obviously the game's going to be supported and updated for years and years to come it's been hugely successful it's made activision it's made the developers a load of money since its release it's been a cash cow but when they make all that cool new content when the new map drops when they change stuff if the story is always oh warzone just has a load of cheaters that's going to be the topic of conversation isn't it you're not going to be able to get new players because what have they heard about the game oh it's just cheats everywhere i'm not even going to bother and maybe one or two of them have tried the game and they just got beamed from 500 meters away by some kid cheating aimbotting them across the map and the existing players are going to stop playing too because it's just painful i love this game i think it's great it's given me some of the best gaming memories over the last 16 months or so lockdown was way easier because of cod warzone it's so fun and addictive to me but all that goes away the second you get killed by a cheater and then it happens the next game and then it happens the next day and you're about to win a match and then someone just beams you through a wall and it goes from a 10 to a 1. that's how it feels so there's a sense of urgency here the developers need to prioritize this the clock is most definitely ticking and why not if i could magic things into existence and i was in charge number one colonel level antique i'd implement that straight away talk to riot games learn from them number two i'd make cross play with pc players off by default for console players and they can volunteer in if they want and now you can enjoy watching me die to an airstrike and losing the match thanks for watching leave a like if you enjoyed the vid let me know your thoughts below see you next time you
